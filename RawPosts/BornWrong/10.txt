Classic!! So\u2026 when I first told everyone at work I was really female and had been all along, it was after months of shaving my facial hair, ostensibly in order to make myself more believable. I kept shaving for months after that, specifically in order to make myself appear credibly female to others. I still got read as male a lot of the time, and I still often got treated weird when seen as female, because I still looked like a fat butch lesbian with a completely flat chest. When I stopped shaving, it turned out the beard really didn\u2019t make much of a difference. Seems like I\u2019m already past some kind of freakishness threshold and out here, it\u2019s kind of a free-for-all. There\u2019s no real winning for women anyway. A lot of the time you might as well do what you want. And I don\u2019t like shaving! Removing my facial hair (besides a tiny little mustache that I\u2019m not overly fond of aesthetically and do spend like 20 seconds shaving every few days) is not something I wanted to do, or something I was doing for myself. Other women have different experiences here, but this is mine. When I\u2019m feeling at or better than my baseline state, which is most the time lately, I like the way I look. I look like a woman I\u2019d be happy to see and happier to get to know. I don\u2019t always stick to my guns on this. I\u2019ve shaved for my last few job interviews, now that my ID says female. I should probably stop doing that. A job that\u2019s hostile to women who look how I usually look isn\u2019t going to be a good fit anyway, something several different women with more life experience than me have expressed. I don\u2019t really feel great about shaving for my driver\u2019s license photo, either. It makes me feel like I\u2019m still prioritizing other people\u2019s ideas of who I should be and how I should look over what I actually feel comfortable with. I\u2019m tired of feeling that way. I feel like I\u2019m still trying to peel away all these bad habits, and trying to please others at the expense of being myself is one of them. I\u2019m not saying these feelings are intrinsic to hair removal. I know plenty of women whose descriptions of their relationships to their facial hair are really different from mine. But I\u2019m not living their lives, and they\u2019re not living mine. If someone else does feel good about removing all that stuff, that\u2019s her business. It doesn\u2019t feel good to me. The more I give myself permission to stop caring what others think, the more relaxed and authentic I can be, and you know what? A lot of people like authentic, even if they also think you\u2019re kind of a freak. Not being so nervous about others see you makes it a lot easier to connect sincerely. Yeah, connecting with a lot of people might also be easier if \u201cbeing authentic\u201d to me didn\u2019t include usually not shaving my neckbeard very often, or if I wasn\u2019t a butch lesbian, but that wouldn\u2019t be my life. Getting hung up on lives that are so different from my own that they\u2019re really entirely another (imaginary!) woman\u2019s life is not helpful to me. I have stuff to do, and this is what I have to work with, and it\u2019s enough. That\u2019s something I keep coming back to: what\u2019s left of my body might be less than ideal in some senses, and the process of that loss was difficult, but there\u2019s clearly enough of me to continue living. Anyway\u2026 feels kinda silly to keep on working through my feelings about my appearance right now. Really seems like things are about to get an awful lot worse here. I guess I\u2019m still dipping in and out of denial about that. Really sucks to be too poor to have an escape plan or even start stockpiling more than a little survival stuff. We\u2019re working on plans for some actual organizing where we are, and in the meantime we\u2019re calling numbers and writing emails. Redressalert\u2019s post related to this stuff is good reading. So is Crash\u2019s. One or both of them link to this really important article by Masha Gessen, a Jewish woman who has survived other autocracies. Gessen has written another article since that\u2019s equally relevant. There is no good reason I can see to be optimistic about the outcome of this election, and being realistic means challenging ourselves to remain present enough that we can react appropriately to the level of threat that is approaching very, very soon.", "feedtitle": "BORN WRONG"}
