Without access to those, I think I would have continued transitioning indefinitely. It didn\u2019t feel like a choice. I have a major beef with that- the idea that transition isn\u2019t a choice. I felt I had no choice but transition for a long time, and the reason I felt that way was because other choices were not offered to me. I didn\u2019t know anyone who had survived feelings like mine without transition, and I didn\u2019t have any ideas about how someone might do that. That\u2019s a problem! How can someone give informed consent to transition when they believe the only alternative is a miserable life eventually cut short by suicide?\u00a0 People who transition believing it\u2019s absolutely the only way they can ever experience any relief are people whose community and healthcare professionals have failed them. No doctor told me that getting a troubled shelter dog and training her as a psychiatric service dog, or being in a loving and supportive relationship, or having a bunch of friends with similar experiences, might provide enough relief that I wouldn\u2019t have to live as a man in order to feel okay. They totally did, though. That definitely happened to me. The fact that a lot of people see advice for coping with distress that doesn\u2019t involve medication or surgery as inherently invalidating is pretty messed up. I\u2019ve seen it expressed that anyone whose drive to transition can be addressed without actually transitioning (or continuing to transition) can\u2019t possibly be experiencing as much pain as someone who\u2019s really trans. Within this model, you aren\u2019t even really suffering unless you believe they\u2019re the only ones who can help. Believing that puts so much power in the hands of for-profit institutions. The tools used by the medical industrial complex can help people, for sure, and everyone is entitled to decide for herself what approaches to try. But it\u2019s just not true that, for someone\u2019s distress to be valid, it has to be unresponsive to everything except pharmaceuticals or surgery. Finding substantial relief outside a doctor\u2019s office does not inherently mean that the condition was any less serious. A woman I know once said something along the lines of, if the top priority of all providers of transgender healthcare services was really to help people feel their best, they\u2019d be banging down the doors of all these women talking about alternative strategies for coping with feelings currently or formerly diagnosable as gender dysphoria. I think this is entirely accurate, and I think it\u2019s telling that it hasn\u2019t happened.", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 BORN WRONG"}
