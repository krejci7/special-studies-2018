I went to Dr Curtis Crane in San Francisco. I\u2019m talking about another \u201cbig name\u201d in transitional surgery, Dr Garramone. I went to go doublecheck the spelling of his name yesterday (I always think it\u2019s Garramond for some reason) and got a look at his website. Which\u2026 like, damn. From his website: ManSculpture\u00ae Body Masculinization: Transgender Surgery ManSculpture\u00ae Body Masculinization is commonly performed at the same time as the FTM Top Surgery\u00ae Procedure. This consists of shaping the body to a more \u201cmasculine\u201d form with the use of Power Assisted Liposuction techniques. By lipocontouring the abdomen (stomach), love handles (flanks), and the \u201csaddle bag\u201d area of the outside hips or thighs with ManSculpting, Dr. Garramone can give your body a more streamlined and masculine appearance. This is an attempt to up-sell\u2026 Garramone\u2019s special\u00a0trademarked manly lipo (you\u2019ve got to specify it\u2019s masculine, because getting fat removed from your body is culturally coded as feminine)\u00a0costs $2500\u00a0to\u00a0$6000 extra. With the use of the derisive terms \u201clove handles\u201d and \u201csaddle bags\u201d, he\u2019s using the \u201cproblem-agitate-solve\u201d advertising strategy. This is used most transparently in infomercials for quick fix products. Here\u2019s a rundown of the structure from a marketing blog: Problem: Identify your reader\u2019s pain point. Agitate: Stir it up so it hurts to the point of discomfort. Solve: Deliver a solution. The problem readers are having is profound, life-altering levels of disconnect and/or distress with their bodies. The language here is intended to agitate these feelings\u00a0by using\u00a0words that connote\u00a0disgust for body fat, particularly disgust for typically female patterns of body fat distribution. The solution is liposuction. Deliberately playing on\u00a0the emotional problems of those who seek transition in order to \u201cmove product\u201d should not be considered acceptable conduct from someone providing a surgery that\u2019s thought to be the only way to avoid death by suicide. If you think transition is essential to surviving the desire to transition, you should be horrified to see this shit. Somebody offering you a lifeboat shouldn\u2019t be saying \u201chey, for $2500 to $6000 more, I\u2019ll throw in some water bottles, and by the way, you look fat\u00a0from up here.\u201d That is not the kind of help anyone should be grateful for. The fact that this guy is still getting paid a shit ton of money to remove healthy tissue, despite a clear lack of empathy for his patients, speaks to the chronic low self-worth and desperation that tends to drive business for any cosmetic surgeon. It\u2019s worth noting here that an awful lot of people who are seeking transitional surgery (myself included) spend months obsessing over their prospective surgeon, reading and rereading every relevant page of their website. For me, this was true from the very early phases, when I was really just fantasizing, all the way up to right before my operation. My impression from the time I\u2019ve spent in both transition and detransition community online has led me to believe I was very typical in this respect. Garramone almost certainly has a huge amount of repeating traffic from the same viewers, which has to heighten the emotion impact of the strategically misogynistic language chosen. The phrases \u201clove handles\u201d and \u201csaddle bags\u201d aren\u2019t just agitating to FTMs. They\u2019re a part of the language of self-disgust that all women are taught. One of the patriarchally-approved techniques we are given to soothe\u00a0ourselves is\u00a0externalizing this shame, so it\u2019s also how many women talk about body fat in general. I googled \u201clove handle liposuction\u201d for a minute and that\u2019s apparently how an awful lot of plastic surgeons refer to the flanks. Really? It\u2019s coercive to deliberately activate shame in order to convince people made vulnerable by an incredibly toxic society that\u00a0removing healthy tissue will solve their emotional problems. Cosmetic surgeons, including those offering transitional surgery, are\u00a0trying to move product.\u00a0Like most people in sales, they prey on emotional vulnerabilities. When I went to Curtis Crane\u2019s office for my double mastectomy consult, I couldn\u2019t believe how nice the staff treated me. As a teenage butch lesbian with learning disabilities who was\u00a0unable to perform male-defined femininity \u201ccorrectly\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0pretty much always perceived as \u201cweird\u201d or outright pegged as a dyke, I was not used to strangers being that kind to me. I haven\u2019t had strangers treat me with that kind of impersonal\u00a0sweetness anywhere else except church. The last time it happened at church was while I was working a couple weeks ago and taking a man to a sign language service at the Kingdom Hall. I got offered two different jobs, they made sure I got seconds (my food/body\u00a0issues have improved in a lot of ways but I still have\u00a0a real weakness for anyone\u00a0who indicates they don\u2019t want me to starve\u00a0until I look \u201cbetter\u201d). A part of me wanted to go back following their dress code, the first time I had even thought of\u00a0going out in public wearing clothes I hated in years. That\u2019s how lovebombing makes you feel- it makes you want to do whatever\u2019s necessary to keep that attention coming. Another experience that reminded me of Crane was going to the dermatologist who prescribed me Accutane when I was 14, a woman who had visibly had a decent amount of elective procedures on her face. She\u00a0looked at my (moderate and typical for my age group) acne with such pity and she promised she was going to help me\u00a0be the beautiful young woman I was meant to be. The concept of a life-changing\u00a0makeover is not a new one to any woman. As someone who has a trauma response to dressing \u201clike a girl\u201d, the pressure to be beautiful (according to male standards) has been painful in a specific way. Lots of women have tried to help me look more like them all my life.\u00a0My degree of compliance varied by situation, but I consistently experienced these efforts as a rejection of me as I already was, whether or not I let on about it. How did I convince myself that trying to transform myself into a man was going to feel any better than trying to transform myself into a type of woman I never\u00a0had any interest in being? Sometimes I can follow my old logic, sometimes I can\u2019t. Neither made sense without the basic assumption that I needed fixing. Neither made sense without a fundamental lack of faith in the ability of butch lesbians to live meaningful lives. I don\u2019t know. Fuck Garramone, and fuck Crane.", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 BORN WRONG"}
