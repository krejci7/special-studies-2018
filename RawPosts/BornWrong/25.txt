He\u2019s got hip dysplasia, he sheds more than any animal\u00a0I\u2019ve ever met, he drools constantly. He has this habit of coming over to us on the couch and bumping into you with his head and snuffling you all over, which could be cute if he wasn\u2019t always drooling. Since he IS always drooling, this\u00a0wipes\u00a0pretty impressive amounts of drool all over your body. Drool isn\u2019t just like a lot of spit, by the way. That\u2019s what I thought it was going to be when I got him, but it\u2019s more\u00a0like spit mixed with snot. It\u2019s viscous and it doesn\u2019t dry clear. The strands collect his own hair, dirt,\u00a0and wet chunks of whatever horrible thing\u00a0he\u2019s gotten into that day. They swing off when he trots around.\u00a0Sometimes one just hits you out of nowhere. He doesn\u2019t listen, either. We\u2019ve been trying for years to get Kovu\u00a0to sit down before he talks to us on the couch, instead of coming over and wiping his slime mouth all over us and whatever notebooks, computers, sewing projects, etc we\u2019re looking at. Every single time he does it, we ask him to sit down (it gets his head and drool\u00a0away from us). He just looks at you. When you\u2019ve got food, he sits real quick, but good luck the rest of the time. You can look away and completely ignore him and he\u2019s still gonna put his big wet head on you for like, 10-60 seconds before he finally sits down, if he ever even does. Sometimes he just slimes you and then stomps\u00a0off all bow-legged to go ruin some other corner of the house. He\u2019s extremely naughty\u00a0and\u00a0I love him\u00a0very much. When I was 18 and going to community college (which lasted like, 6 months) I took this color theory class for fine arts credits. It was after my mastectomy but\u00a0before I\u2019d been on hormones long enough to pass consistently. Most everyone in the color theory class thought I was a woman. Same in cycling, I think. I only passed in biology. I can\u2019t remember how I felt about that. So one of the big projects in color theory was a monochromatic self-portrait. I suck at human faces, could not stand to think about my appearance, and was tired of feeling\u00a0conspicuously worse than everybody else in the class, so I painted Kovu\u00a0instead. My artist\u2019s statement was about what him and me had in common, which I think pretty much boiled down to \u201cwe both do our best and we still mess everything up\u201d. I would have just been diagnosed with ADD then, but I didn\u2019t really know what it meant. For the first time, when I saw a psychiatrist with\u00a0a flat chest and real straggly facial hair, the issues I\u2019d had functioning at the same level as my peers in many areas weren\u2019t explained away by how sad I was. I stayed on Wellbutrin, but he gave me\u00a0Adderal, too. That was the end of the conversation. It didn\u2019t even occur to me for another 2 years to look up \u201cADD adult women\u201d- I was a man, and I was fine now. I took the pills and could not believe the difference it made- I had one complete thought about the actual environment in front of me at a time. New thoughts followed in a logical order and at a manageable speed, instead of a half dozen scattered racing streams of anxious tangents overlapping each other. I got my homework done. I didn\u2019t wander off.\u00a0It\u00a0just felt like being normal, more normal than I\u2019d ever been before. The constant screw-ups slowed down. I didn\u2019t microwave cups of noodles without water\u00a0or\u00a0lock myself out as often. Making fewer mistakes made me feel like a more lovable person. I just wanted to stop being the problem. Part of why I love Kovu so much is that no matter how incredibly inconvenient he is to us, he never actually seems to think it\u2019s his fault. He does the scolded dog look and all that\u00a0sometimes when you\u2019re really put out with him, but even then, it\u2019s\u00a0so obvious that he has no idea why you don\u2019t want to be buddies\u00a0right then. It\u2019s just never occurred to him that screwing everything up could be connected to people being annoyed with you sometimes. Self-blame\u00a0is entirely unthinkable to this dog, and\u00a0I envy that\u00a0more than I can even figure out how to express. I feel consumed by shame constantly, all day, sometimes. Shame for things I just did, shame for things that I did last month, shame for things I did in 6th grade. Feels like I\u2019m a big old carcass getting torn to shreds\u00a0by a billion different shames, a whole ecosystem of lively and diverse shames. An awful lot of the time, all I can feel for myself is complete disgust. This has been getting better in the last year or so, but that\u2019s really, really new for me. Something I would have learned, if I would have been seen as a woman, if my doctor had known anything or actually given a shit, would have been that growing up female and attention deficit means growing up believing that it\u2019s your fault you aren\u2019t the same as your peers. Reading\u00a0Sari Solden\u2019s book\u00a0\u00a0about this recently was absolutely crazy- it never occurred to me that I could exist without constant overwhelming shame over all the stuff I couldn\u2019t always do right. Like, that was a new concept to me. I wanted that for myself, clearly\u2026 I wanted to be like Kovu. A lot of my tumblr friends during the years when I was transitioning were \u201cotherkin\u201d: people who identified with some non-human entity so strongly that they felt it was more accurate to say that they identified AS the entity. I found these groups from others mocking them but ended up sticking around. We were all very traumatized and this coping mechanism never struck as all that much worse than any of the other weird shit we did. I didn\u2019t argue with anyone about it but never did understand the necessity of leap between \u201cidentifying with\u201d and \u201cidentifying as\u201d, since they would all clarify when pressed that they knew they weren\u2019t literally what they described themselves as, and were clear about it being a spiritual belief/coping strategy. An awful lot of otherkin I knew started out just doing a lot of roleplaying online. I didn\u2019t consider myself \u201ckin\u201d in any sense, but in a way, I envied them, too. Obviously that\u2019s not reasonable or fair\u2026 all of us had horrible lives in a lot of ways. But secretly, I still loved the idea of actually convincing myself I was a dog and having my friends all agree. What stopped me from doing what some of my friends were doing wasn\u2019t not wishing I was a dog. What stopped me was my fear of looking stupid. Pretty much all of my otherkin friends also identified as trans. I saw them doing the same kind of clue-seeking\u00a0looks into their childhood that take place in my process of justifying my transition to myself. Things like \u201cI always loved playing in the dirt\u201d were used to support a current identity as a certain Digimon\u00a0or whatever. I could see the flimsiness of this logic even then.\u00a0These people talked a lot about how \u201ckin positivity\u201d, but\u00a0considering themselves non-human didn\u2019t appear to be enhancing the quality of their lives in any material sense, at least as far as I\u00a0could discern. \u201cIt\u2019s a coping strategy for my trauma/mental illness\u00a0and you don\u2019t know my life\u201d was pretty much always the end of any conversation about whether or not this was helping. Even so\u2026 few months before I finally started letting myself\u00a0question the efficacy of transition as a strategy in my life, I remember making this rambling post about how one of the reasons I identified as male and liked he pronouns was because it felt closer to being a dog than she pronouns or femaleness. That\u2019s where my line of reasoning stopped, at that point. The broader context of the circles I was in allowed for me to say something like this without anyone asking any of the questions\u00a0that the statement pretty much begs:\u00a0why do you want to be a dog? What is that dogs and men have in common that you want badly enough to\u00a0justify\u00a0hormones, surgery, and everything else? It would have startled me to hear, but I think I could have answered it, even then. Here\u2019s some of the reasons I think I\u2019d have given:  People expect less of dogs. People are\u00a0nice to dogs. When dogs make a mistake, people don\u2019t\u00a0treat them bad for it. Dogs get to go outside a lot. Dogs don\u2019t have to worry what anybody thinks of them.  I\u2019m just noticing now is that all these things assume the dog (or the man) isn\u2019t abused or neglected. \u201cAlways greener on the other side\u201d thinking was a big part of transition for me. I was really into convincing myself that the outcome\u00a0I\u00a0would get from these steps would always be the \u201cbest\u201d one possible. With my double mastectomy, I knew that noticeable asymmetry, results\u00a0very different from a male chest, nerve damage, and loss of nipple sensation were risks I was assuming, and if you asked me, I would have said that all of those things\u00a0very carefully.\u00a0I think I really did usually believe that (there were always cracks in my self-deception), but it was not true. I was way too dissociated to truly engage in earnest with the subject matter: my own body. In no sense did I actually try to imagine the reality of living with so many of the experiences that\u00a0I have no choice but to live with now. My priorities were so different then. Having it \u201clook good\u201d and happen quickly was what I wanted most. The insurance I had would have covered an in-network guy, but the only review I could find of his work was that they had ended up going to Dr Crane for a revision anyway. I had been\u00a0earning\u00a0royalties since I was 16 designing\u00a0print-to-order gifts and apparel with the intention of using it for surgery and for college, so with some help from my family, I could afford him. I knew Garramone had more male-looking results with chests the size of mine, but I didn\u2019t want to fly to Florida. Here\u2019s an aside real quick\u2026 just googled his name to check my spelling and the description for his site includes a trademark registered with a national trademark office:\u00a0\u201cTop Surgery \u00ae Florida \u2013 Dr. Garramone performs the best FTM Top Surgery \u00ae Procedure, Periareolar, Keyhole, Double Incision, and DI offered in Florida\u201d. I hadn\u2019t been to his site in a long time. It\u2019s a lot more transparent about marketing transitional surgery than I\u00a0recall noticing\u00a0in 2012 or whatever. The way my chest actually looks now is not a possibility I had actually seriously considered, as far as I can remember, even though I don\u2019t think it\u2019s especially unusual as far as results go.\u00a0I thought anything would be better than having breasts, but I refused to investigate my feelings about the individual outcomes contained within that \u201canything\u201d. Not that I\u2019d feel any better if my chest did look identical to a man\u2019s. I\u00a0don\u2019t believe anymore that cosmetic surgery can \u201cgo right\u201d.\u00a0Wanting to look different so badly that you actually pay\u00a0money to be drugged to unconsciousness, cut apart, and wake up stuck back together by doctors (who get paid to do this all the time)\u2026 how could that be anything but traumatic? I understand that many survivors of cosmetic surgery disagree with me on this.\u00a0They\u2019re fully entitled to believe what they will about their own experiences, and about cosmetic surgery as a practice. But so am I. My biggest hope for conversations about these topics isn\u2019t that whoever I\u2019m talking to agrees with everything I say.\u00a0All I really want is to for us to be able to listen to each other. For most of my transition, I would have completely shut down if I tried to read anything like\u00a0the kind of stuff I write now. I remember trying to write rebuttals to feminist writing on transition that I found offensive but never being able to get more than a few words down, because the possibility that transition was not this\u00a0saving grace\u00a0made me too distressed to think straight. I was extremely dissociated and absolutely miserable in my body. I had done an awful lot of things trying to feel better, and nothing had worked. I just wanted something to\u00a0work. By the time it was becoming difficult to keep convincing myself transition had resolved these issues that were clearly still present, I had already invested so much.\u00a0I didn\u2019t want to die, and this had seemed like the only way to stay alive. It was really fucking hard\u00a0to admit I was wrong. If I hadn\u2019t been in a place with more stability and supportive women in my life than I\u2019ve ever had before, I think I would have backed out. Actually facing my reality\u00a0has been\u00a0much, much harder than transition. Lately I\u2019ve been working on the way I tend to think or sometimes actually say \u201cI want to die\u201d whenever anything goes wrong, which got a lot worse when I went off Cymbalta. Now, when it happens, I remind myself that I don\u2019t really want that. I just am feeling hopeless. I walk myself through naming what\u2019s bothering me and making a plan to address it. That means taking steps like\u00a0considering a transfer at work, quitting weed, trying to find somebody to talk to about my feelings, or whatever. I\u2019ve been noticing that for me now, the way I feel when I say \u201cI want to die\u201d is pretty close to the\u00a0way I remember feeling\u00a0when I was obsessively fixated on the whatever next\u00a0step of my transition. It\u2019s an\u00a0attempt to find a shred of hope in hopelessness, to believe that\u00a0something\u00a0can relieve my pain, whether that\u2019s suicide or facial hair. These thoughts are a feeble attempt to combat learned helplessness. They are a maladaptive expression of resilience in the face of a world that is built to destroy women like me any way it can.\u00a0\u201cIf I\u2019m the problem, I can fix it\u201d lines of thinking justified my suicidal ideation as well as transition. My overwhelming\u00a0self-blame seems like an\u00a0attempt to claim control where I feel I have none. Do I really have\u00a0none, though? Not quite.\u00a0I\u2019m realizing that now, as an adult woman, I\u00a0have a lot more control than I ever realized. I don\u2019t have as much control as I want, and I don\u2019t have as much control as I feel women deserve. Still, an awful lot of what has kept me still in fear is not material barriers. It\u2019s the fear I have been taught since girlhood. Why bother locking women in\u00a0if we\u2019re all\u00a0too scared to go outside anyway? Patriarchy has grown complacent in the totality of its reign over women. The more time I spend actively training myself out of learned helplessness, the easier it\u2019s becoming to strategize around the obstacles that are not just in my head. I\u00a0don\u2019t know. I\u00a0meant to tie this all together more coherently\u00a0but I\u2019m kind of losing interest. The main thing is, I don\u2019t think anybody is actually born wrong anymore, but that kind of thinking was a major part of why I transitioned. Now, I believe everyone deserves the quality of support\u00a0and accommodations necessary for her to live as she is.\u00a0I do not believe that the male medical industrial complex is a great place to find\u00a0genuine healing from issues of\u00a0profound and life-altering bodily dissociation/distress.", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 BORN WRONG"}
