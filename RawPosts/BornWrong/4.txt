I understand that when you talk to a journalist, you lose control of the narrative to a significant degree, and we willingly signed up for that. It was a gamble and the outcome was middling, where \u201cgood\u201d is Katie Herzog\u2019s article and \u201creally bad\u201d is a Daily Mail shock piece. I wouldn\u2019t highly recommend media contact with Charlotte McCann to anyone in detransition community, even so. Making yourself that vulnerable on a very public scale isn\u2019t worth it for a \u201ccould be worse\u201d article. It\u2019s worth it for a genuinely good one. I\u2019m not trying to stop people from sharing it or anything. I\u2019m really glad others are finding value in it and if I was able to be more objective, I might like it more, but some of the stuff that bothered me feels really personal and is hard to be perfectly diplomatic about. Honestly, I really liked Charlie, too. Would absolutely still recommend her as a house guest. The photographer was totally cool to work with, too, super nice about our various neuroses. Anyway, this response is mainly for talking about with people who know me personally, so that I don\u2019t have to keep explaining everything I found frustrating, and for myself, so that I stop reciting in my head everything that\u2019s bugging me about that article.  Our house is not a trash hoard, in case you were wondering. We have some thrifted paintings and ceramics that apparently some people might think belong in garbage cans. Fair enough, different strokes, but I would have appreciated clearer language there. \u201cFull of junk\u201d implies our house wasn\u2019t clean. It was. The guy who died a few months ago, the one I was supporting at work whose picture is on my wall, isn\u2019t any type of Asian, and neither of us ever said he was. He was Alaska Native. I\u2019m assuming she just guessed based on the photo. If a reporter is going to describe someone I cared a lot about, whose death really messed with me, with very little information other than his race, it feels to me like it wouldn\u2019t be that hard to ask where his family was from. Honestly, this is what\u2019s bothering me the most and probably a big reason why I\u2019m feeling so cranky about the whole article. I worked really hard to meet his needs and advocate for his rights when he was alive, but now he\u2019s dead, and there really isn\u2019t anything I can do about it. It sucks. Feeling like his picture on our wall is being used as a vehicle to make some weird assumptions about me and my partner\u2019s life, and have disrespectful assumptions about his race thrown in, is pretty shitty. My face was never sharp. I\u2019ve been at least kind of fat as long as I was on testosterone. I had more masculine facial fat distribution when I was on HRT, but \u201csharp\u201d is a serious stretch. Anyway, I didn\u2019t show her any pictures of myself on testosterone. Since neither of us said my face was ever sharp and we never showed her any pictures, I found that comment weird. My skin wasn\u2019t rough, either. I get cold easier now because testosterone makes your skin thicker. I haven\u2019t noticed my skin feeling softer, just the difference in cold sensitivity. Again, weird, since we didn\u2019t say it and I feel like I would remembered this lady having touched my skin a couple years back. I was diagnosed as ADD and bipolar three or four years ago, not exactly recently. \u201cFTMTF\u201d is not how I understand myself. I\u2019m actually pretty sure I recall the term coming up, and us saying something along the lines of, we don\u2019t know anyone who uses that language for herself and we don\u2019t feel it\u2019s accurate. I was really, really clear that I have been female this whole time. I have never used that term for myself and actually find it pretty distasteful. I felt the off-and-on he pronoun thing was gimmicky, distracting, and inaccurate. Like\u2026 the sentence \u201cWhen Max was 19, just over three years after he came out as transgender, she realised he\u2019d made a mistake\u201d? Geez. I\u2019m actually one person. Just the one. I don\u2019t feel separating myself into at least two, if not more, is actually gonna do me any favors. I didn\u2019t use male pronouns for myself at any point in our conversation. I was very clear that I have been a girl/woman and a lesbian the entire time. I notice at another point in the article, when describing a theoretical \u201cpre-everything\u201d three year old ostensibly beginning identify as a transgender girl, the preferred pronoun of that hypothetical toddler is used. In contrast, I was referred to as male intermittently throughout, although I was super clear about not identifying that way. Just something I noticed. We did talk about this before the article came out- Charlie asked me how I felt about it, I expressed that I hated it and why, she said that she could try to talk to her editor if I absolutely insisted but she firmly believed that would ruin the story. At that point I repeated that I hated it but that obviously, she was the journalist here and it was her call. Which it was. I requested that, in spite of the pronoun switching, she made it clear that I believe I have been female the whole time, that transition happened to me as a girl and as a woman. She assured me this would be clear. I don\u2019t feel that \u201cMax is a woman and has been one for two years\u201d communicates this at all. In fact, it specifically communicates the opposite. \u201cMax detransitioned for several reasons; the most significant one was that she is not transgender\u201d is an oversimplification that I specifically addressed during our interview. I told her that while transitioning, I was as transgender as anyone else, that there\u2019s no single part of my experiences that applies only to women who would eventually detransition, that everything you could pick out as a reason why I \u201cwasn\u2019t ever trans\u201d is something that applies to a bunch of people who haven\u2019t stopped identifying as trans. I said that by some definitions, I still am transgender, although I don\u2019t describe myself that way: I pass as male frequently, I\u2019m butch, I have issues with people feeling my legal sex doesn\u2019t match my appearance. I told her I still experience the feelings that motivated me to transition, and that I don\u2019t see an inherent difference between me and those who continue transition. Kitty and I explained that we feel transition is one strategy for coping with dysphoria, but that both of us now utilize other strategies. I do not feel that any of these nuances were conveyed. The reporter only spent time in our living room and bathroom, where we don\u2019t have any pictures of ourselves up. There\u2019s actually a bunch of pictures, including both of us and many of our friends, by our kitchen table, on our cork board. She never asked about this and it never came up, as far as I remember. Kinda makes all the extrapolation about why we don\u2019t have those pictures up seem silly.  Basically: reading this article makes me feel like a lot of what I said in that interview wasn\u2019t actually heard. I\u2019m having a hard time being objective about it. That being said, I still hope it can do some good, and I feel this was a productive learning experience for me and my partner.", "feedtitle": "BORN WRONG"}
