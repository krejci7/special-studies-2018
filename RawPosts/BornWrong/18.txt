Um\u2026 nerve damage. That\u2019s not fun. It really did not seem like that big of a deal to me, when I was, um, looking into surgery, I read all my side effects, signed all my papers, went to the doctor\u2026 I did everything right, everyone told me what was what gonna happen. Um, but, if you don\u2019t have, like, nerve damage\u2026 I mean any medical thing, anything you haven\u2019t experienced yet, you don\u2019t really know what it\u2019s like. But specifically right now, I\u2019m talking about like\u2026 if you don\u2019t have nerve damage, you don\u2019t really know what that\u2019s like, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re signing up for. Um\u2026 it\u2019s pretty distressing to have an area of your body where you\u00a0 used to feel something\u2026 feel dead. I mean, it feels the same as like\u2026 when your mouth is numb. Sometimes. Sometimes it hurts like hell. And that\u2019s the other thing is it\u2019s like, it\u2019s all over the place? Um, it\u2019s really really weird to go from having normal sensation on a part of your body, to be, you know, drugged to sleep and wake up, and then going forward, for years going forward, you have no sensation, or pain, or no sensation mixed with pain, or like dead and pain, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s crazy! It\u2019s really hard to describe. In terms of like what sensation feels like, nerve damage kind of feels like it\u2019s like, off the sensation spectrum, like it\u2019s not really a kind of feeling I had considered existed before. Um, and you know\u2026 when I was with someone else who was trans, who I felt really comfortable with, who was getting a mastectomy, like, my chest was able- I was able to experience my chest as a part of our like, you know, intimacy together. A lot of other things went wrong in that relationship, but I did experience my chest, as a a part of my sexuality. And that\u2019s very weird, to go from having something\u2026 potentially, with the right person you feel really really comfortable with, in terms of those issues, be a part of my sexuality, versus feeling dead, it feels dead, or painful. Um\u2026 so yeah, and you know, I thought anything was better than what I had. But you know, I wasn\u2019t super realistic about how top surgery turns out when you\u2019re not, you know, the \u201cright\u201d size. My surgeon\u2026 my surgeon told me, the same as if someone was much smaller than me- or you know, whatever- if someone was- the \u201cright\u201d size for a surgery like this. Um\u2026 I really, I really didn\u2019t know what that would mean. Not that I think I\u2019d feel any better about my chest, if it looked super symmetrical and everything. I don\u2019t think that I would. But I mean, it does kind of strike me that, you know, I wasn\u2019t expecting this, even though by any reasonable measure, I should have been. I\u2019d seen pictures of people who had had surgery with, you know, I\u2019d like, like, 32DDs, and I wasn\u2019t super really thin, you know, kind of\u2026 regular. So\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I think that\u2019s another element that demonstrates kind of how, you can go into this and sign everything and say all the right words, and not really have it be real to you, what the actual results might be. And my nipples- whew! Oh my goodness. Yikes! Um\u2026 they still look like scar tissue, it\u2019s been like three years, and they still are like\u2026 you know they\u2019re not really perfectly round, they\u2019re kind of\u2026tore up, you know, they kind of look\u2026 I don\u2019t know. They don\u2019t look\u2026 nothing looks the way I thought it would. And I didn\u2019t have any real good reason to think it would look that way, either, I was just, you know, I wasn\u2019t being realistic with myself. I would say all the right words, but inside, I wasn\u2019t really realistic with myself. And you know, nipple sensation. Whew! You know, that\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s coming back. Um, I have almost no feeling and what I do have is pain, and it feels, it just feels nasty, it feels crazy. And it just brings up, you know, all the other feelings about my chest. Um\u2026 like you know, there\u2019s little pockets on the front of your shirt? When I\u2019m wearing TWO shirts, I love putting shit in my front pocket. Super convenient. I work at a job where there\u2019s a bunch of keys, so I can keep my keys in the front pocket. Uh\u2026 keep my phone in the front pocket. And then summer comes and I\u2019m wearing one shirt, and I put, and I try to put something in the front pocket on my tshirt, and it\u2019s like oh shit, because it\u2019s like on my nipple, and it just feels horrible. So then every time I go to put my phone away, I\u2019m like- I\u2019m attention deficit, real attention deficit, and so I just forget all fucking day. So I\u2019m constantly being reminded that you know, you can\u2019t use the front pocket of your shirt, or else you\u2019ll have to think about your fucking chest all day. Um\u2026 yeah\u2026 um, you know\u2026 it\u2019s not symmnetrical. I\u2019m off testosterone now, I have been for like a year, and tissue\u2019s kind of coming back there a little bit, you know, because whenever- it doesn\u2019t generally come back until your weight starts shifting around, but I guess mine is now, a little bit, because my chest has a little bit more, like, breast kind of tissue, and then\u2026 um\u2026 and it\u2019s super weird, because the new tissue has normal feeling, but the old tissue doesn\u2019t\u2026 like, a lot of it is still nerve damage-y\u2026 I don\u2019t know it\u2019s just! It\u2019s crazy! I don\u2019t know how to describe nerve damage. Super weird though. And if you know, it turns out that this isn\u2019t something you have\u2026 easy feelings about, nerve damage sure as shit doesn\u2019t help with that, damn! It so super does not help! Um\u2026 so yeah, I guess, just wanted to talk about that, basically. Um\u2026 just wanted to talk about how things can turn out, because this is a reality, is that, there was nothing before I transitioned that would have clearly distinguished me from anyone else. That\u2019s, I mean, my gender therapist is, was experienced, and had a lot of, you know, had a lot of experience with this stuff, with a lot of people, and we\u2019ve talked about how this all turned out for me. I don\u2019t see a gender therapist anymore, whoo, I don\u2019t see any therapist, damn, hoo. Um\u2026 but I email with my gender therapist, and we talk about this, and I don\u2019t think my gender therapist knew this was something that could happen to me, either, I don\u2019t think anyone knew. And that\u2019s kind of the problem. I mean, at the very least, people should be aware that this is how it can turn out, that you can end up- years into it, years into it, you can realize\u2026 hey, um\u2026 I\u2019m a fucking lesbian, and I really fucked up. And now, you know, I have to live with that. And that\u2019s, this is where, you know- and there\u2019s, you know, there\u2019s ways to move forward from it, there\u2019s talking about your feelings, there\u2019s connecting with other people, there\u2019s plenty of things you can do, but\u2026 I would not wish this on anyone. It would have been a LOT easier to not have that surgery. I really would have done myself some favors with THAT. Um\u2026 so yeah. Um\u2026 well, bye.", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 BORN WRONG"}
