I wanted to talk a little bit about how I experienced passing, as a man- and I mean I still experience it, you know, because people, people don\u2019t really know what to make of this\u2026 um\u2026 at first, I started passing about six months or so after I got my mastectomy, because I got a round little face. And it took a long time for my voice to even drop as much as I did, I had, uh, I was pretty shrill\u2026 um\u2026 so, when I first started passing, it was pretty cool, uh, it was really cool. I felt like I was becoming this new person who could have an easier life. I felt like I was re-creating myself, I was\u2026 I don\u2019t know, um, I felt like I was being seen. And\u2026 the longer it went, the less I felt like that. The more time I spent with men thinking I was men, being treated the way men treat other men, and women treating me the way they treat men\u2026 it was intensely distressing. It did not feel like I was being seen. Once I realized what other people meant when they saw me that way, and what that meant to them, whether or not they would have defined it the way I did or even noticed they were treating me differently\u2026 it\u2019s a lot. Like, I, I\u2019ve done\u2026 I work in group homes, I\u2019ve done work in group homes for a while, and when I was a man- \u201cwhen I was a man\u201d! I mean, I wasn\u2019t ever a man. But when people thought I was a man, they expected me to clean so much less. People were so much nicer to me. You know, I\u2019m, kind of mental health-wise, I\u2019m kind of a shitshow. Um, and, um, people were so much more patient about attention deficit stuff, like about needing help, needing them to explain things, and go over stuff when I screwed stuff up\u2026 people were so much more patient with me. When I was like, kind of nervous socially, people would go out of their way to try and make me feel comfortable, in a way that I had never experienced before, you know, in my life as a woman who looked like a lesbian. And, um, going back\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s, you know, people treat me differently again. People, I\u2026 you know, I told my coworkers. I made them transfer me sites and everything, I told\u2026 my supervisor and everybody, that, you know\u2026 \u201cwoman all along\u201d\u2026 I goofed\u2026and so, now I\u2019m back to working in an environment where everyone knows I\u2019m a woman. And the expectations are higher again, you know, people want me to clean more, people are passive aggressive when I forget to clean, you know, it\u2019s different, you know? And group homes are kind of interesting, the ones I work in, because it\u2019s kind of\u2026 obviously it\u2019s very different, but in some ways it\u2019s kind of similar to a family environment, in that there\u2019s a lot of like, domestic labor, and like, emotional labor, are big things, that you\u2019re helping these people with their problems and talking to them. And like, the expectations on me in this environment, are wildly different when people think I\u2019m a man versus when I\u2019m not. People expect so much more emotional work from me, and like, support for people emotionally from me\u2026 the people I support too, expect more from me when they think I\u2019m a woman than when I\u2019m a man. Um\u2026 yeah, it\u2019s just a trip. And you know, women are scared of you, the way they\u2019re scared of men. And that makes to be scared of men, and it make sense to be scared of me when you think I\u2019m a man, but shit\u2026 I guess, I don\u2019t know. Part of transitioning for me was- I mean, I don\u2019t know if it was part of transitioning exactly. But\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Part of being a lesbian to me, and I think for other lesbians but especially if you look, you look more butch, is\u2026 this fear of being like a man, of being scary, of being predatory, of being dangerous. And having other people reinforce to me that I was a man, and reinforced to myself that I was a man, and have it reinforced to me that it\u2019s correct when other people treat me like a man\u2026 that did not do me any favors. Um\u2026 because I\u2019m not, that\u2019s not the reality, it\u2019s just not true. There was a time when I wanted that to be true, and\u2026 even then, it wasn\u2019t true, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not a man. Um\u2026 and, you know, as intensely as passing felt like being seen at first, is exactly how intensely I feel erased now. I, it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. I mean, I felt like I was doing the right thing, and even like, a couple months before I stopped transitioning, I would have told you, you know, this is who I am, I can\u2019t help it. Um\u2026 but, obviously that didn\u2019t play out. So yeah. Um\u2026 I guess just\u2026 feel like I haven\u2019t seen enough\u2026 you know, it\u2019s obviously really hard to talk about, but I haven\u2019t seen a lot of conversation about how difficult passing can be emotionally, for someone who hasn\u2019t grown up as a man, who hasn\u2019t been taught that they deserve to be given all of the things men are given at the expense of women. Um\u2026 it just, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s just like fingers in the wound, of like, you know, you do not deserve\u2026 this is not, this is not for you. This is for men. It just feels like\u2026 I don\u2019t know, it just reminds me, it just reminded me\u2026 you know, that\u2026 that wasn\u2019t how people saw me, that wasn\u2019t what, deep down, these people would think of me, if they knew I was female. They would not think, that, you know, that I deserved all this help. I was getting this nice treatment because they thought I was someone I was not. And you know, I couldn\u2019t talk about my childhood? You know, I\u2019d tell\u2026 I have sisters, I have all these stories about my sisters, and it\u2019s really hard to talk about your relationship with your sisters, when everyone thinks you\u2019re a man, you know, you can\u2019t talk about Girl Scouts, you know, there\u2019s so much shit, there\u2019s just so much shit. Couldn\u2019t talk- the only girl on cross country, I couldn\u2019t talk about being the only girl on cross country, there\u2019s just all these parts of my life, that, you know, you can\u2019t just\u2026 you know, it\u2019s not like a video game, you can\u2019t just change the gender, change the pronouns, and the story stays intact. Nothing makes any- it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t work anymore. I can\u2019t just\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Um\u2026 yeah. And I mean, I still get, I still get read as male all the time now. But it\u2019s different, um, now that I can\u2026 now that I\u2019m not so dependent on other people to see me. Now that I know what I am, regardless of what someone else sees or doesn\u2019t see. Having some stability in my self-concept, like, makes a huge difference. I don\u2019t, you know, I don\u2019t\u2026 obviously I am \u201cmisgendered\u201d, you know, people call me a man all the fucking time, you know, I go to the store, whatever. Um\u2026 but\u2026 it doesn\u2019t change what I know about myself, it doesn\u2019t shake me in the same way. It sets off\u2026 it makes me kind of, you know, makes me have to think about, and do some more processing, do some feelings work, about old feelings, of what it felt like to pass, while I believed that made me a man inside, and this was a true and honest reflection of myself, um\u2026 but\u2026 it doesn\u2019t\u2026 it doesn\u2019t get to me in the same way anymore, um, that it used to, because I know what I am. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just kind of a weird, it\u2019s a weird thing. Because obviously before transition, I didn\u2019t like female pronouns, whatever\u2026whoo\u2026 um, but yeah, I mean, I hated she pronouns, I was all fussed about that. I was very worked up about that. And that was about what they represented to me. The same way male pronouns distressing me now, or I mean, distressing me sometimes now, is about what they represent to me now. Um, my distaste for female pronouns was about what I thought they meant, and the ideas that I had heard and been told over and over again, and that I believed, and did not question, about what it meant to be a woman, and that that was something that could not include me. Which I mean, you know, fair enough. Makes sense that I thought that. I really hadn\u2019t encountered communities where a woman could be like me, where that wasn\u2019t, you know, where I hadn\u2019t spent time anywhere, where, you know,\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t kind of a freak show. And\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Getting to spend time in female space now, with, especially\u2026 the two times I\u2019ve gone to female, uh, events, were events that had a bunch of other, detransitioned and reconciling women, like women who had stopped transition before or after taking medical steps, um\u2026 being around those ladies and getting to talk to everybody and be together, and not be, you know, not be such a fucking freak\u2026 made a huge difference. This is kind of a sidebar, I was trying to talk about how it\u2019s not fun to get seen as a man. But yeah, um\u2026 kind of looped the hell around. It used-for a while, I couldn\u2019t stand either, I didn\u2019t know what the fuck I was gonna do, you know, \u201cnonbinary\u201d, so to speak. But it really just turned out that I needed to do more, do more thinking\u2026 with my girlfriend who also used, she used it pronouns, for years\u2026 we love each other. We were both trans when we met. But yeah, we just had to do more thinking and processing, and, you know, feelings work about what those pronouns meant to us. So yeah, uh, those are my thoughts\u2026 later.", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 BORN WRONG"}
