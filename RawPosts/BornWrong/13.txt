I think they\u2019re kind of like dreams- products of parts of your brain you can\u2019t control, with wildly varying levels of significance. Sometimes it\u2019s meaningless regurgitated images or words, sometimes it\u2019s an expression of shit that runs really deep, sometimes it\u2019s a nasty and disturbing combination. Right now I\u2019m stuck on \u201cI want to be beautiful\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m tired of being ugly\u201d. It feels like it\u2019s my 13 year old self saying that in my head. There\u2019s so much shit there. When I was that age, I had started wearing push-up bras and trying to date guys. It was horrible. I \u201cblended in\u201d exactly as much as I could, and it gave me no relief. It didn\u2019t work. I couldn\u2019t do it right, and even when I got as close as possible for me, it felt like shit. After a couple years of that I gave up and tried to be myself- a cranky lesbian. This was not well-received. Another year and I wanted to transition. The other day, my girlfriend said she wanted everyone in the world to think she was beautiful. I said I wanted that too. She thought for a little bit and then corrected herself, saying what she really wanted was for everybody to think she was valuable. That makes a lot of sense to me. All our lives, women are told a million different ways that our true value is in our looks. This can be incredibly destructive to any woman. Those who do \u201clook right\u201d have their own set of challenges here, but honestly, I don\u2019t know nearly as much about all that. Sharing across that kind of experience gap takes so much vulnerability on both sides. What I know more about is being seen as an unfuckable freak. When that\u2019s how others treat you, of course you think being seen as beautiful is the solution. It\u2019s not really about vanity, or about looking a certain way. Beauty standards are temporally and culturally bound. Wanting to feel worthy of love isn\u2019t. That\u2019s part of why, for a while, I straddled that line, trying to make myself fuckable for men. At the time, I thought that was the same as lovable. I wasn\u2019t allowed to dress how I wanted anyway, so I tried to hide my butchness and play up my DD breasts. It was a really messy few years.\u00a0 I had sex with a man and it was disgusting. I saw my best friend assaulted. A lot of rough family stuff happened. When I came out as trans and was eventually allowed to choose my clothes, that was a really amazing feeling. Throughout transition and detransition, ever since I got control over how I look at around 16, I\u2019ve pretty much stuck with the same look. I get basically the same haircut (which I grow out to variable stages before losing my shit about how bad it looks \u201clong\u201d and cutting it again). I wear mens clothes a couple sizes too big. I don\u2019t wear makeup. I don\u2019t shave, except when I\u2019m feeling self-conscious about my facial hair for some reason. The reason this stuff hasn\u2019t really changed is because, when I\u2019m not freaking out what other people think, I like how I look. I know what I\u2019m comfortable in. So it really makes me feel crazy when I get echoes of adolescent wishes to be pretty and normal. On the other hand, it totally makes sense right now. I feel like a repulsive freak an awful lot lately. It\u2019s hard to remember that I don\u2019t always feel this way. When I\u2019m surrounded by butch women, detransitioned women, and others who don\u2019t fit in a lot of places, I don\u2019t worry that I\u2019m a literal monster who deserves to be immolated for the good of society. What I\u2019m experiencing is not innate to being a funny-looking woman. It\u2019s not caused by my body, and it\u2019s not caused by how I present myself. It\u2019s caused by isolation from supportive community, and forced engagement with people who can\u2019t (or won\u2019t) really see me. Anyway, my girlfriend and me went out to a nature reserve so I feel a lot better than I did when I started writing this. I love algae and willows and weird bugs. We met a nice couple on okcupid last week and I\u2019m trying to make friends with someone from Craigslist. Would super love to have more than zero good friends within a 3 hour drive. Maybe we\u2019ll get there eventually. A billion different pretty necessary expenses we can\u2019t afford have been coming up for months and my work is super stressful, but all things considered, it feels like I\u2019m doing a lot better lately.", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 BORN WRONG"}
