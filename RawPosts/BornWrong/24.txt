Sounds like asofterworld maybe, I used to read them all. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s what I think of as the unifying quality between a seemingly disparate set of activities I\u2019ve done (at different times, not all concurrently) that seemed like they had something unhealthy in common for me. Here\u2019s the set, at least as far as I can remember it right now:  Running 10-25 miles a week Starving myself Testosterone injections Tweezing my eyebrows Shaving  So like\u2026 what linked these things was that I felt like I was stuck forcing myself to repeat these rituals I was miserable (often in pain, always disinterested) during in an attempt (successful or unsuccessful) to create some difference in my appearance that I (publicly or very privately) ascribed an almost religious importance to. To the extent that I could see the change I was manifesting, I would look at it compulsively and ruminate very repetitively on the degree of my \u201csuccess\u201d. I was doing all of these things in part to avoid social consequences, in some way or another. Running was about trying to lose weight and not pissing off my teammates. Starving myself was about thinking people would be nicer to me if I was thinner. Testosterone was about trying to escape the way I was treated as a woman. Tweezing was about thinking people would make fun of my eyebrows (in high school this would have been true\u2026 as an adult it really hasn\u2019t come up, lol). Shaving my arms, legs, and armpits was about not being mocked for not being enough of a woman. Shaving my face was about trying to make myself more palatable to the people who knew I was detransitioned, and so I could feel like it wasn\u2019t my fault when I still got read as male. None of these things made me feel any better. Treating my body as the problem has never moved me towards healing. It just reinforced that I\u2019m not good enough and that I don\u2019t deserve to control my own appearance. This isn\u2019t how I want to relate to my body anymore. I\u2019m tired of training myself I\u2019m shit by forcing myself to do activities I find painful and/or tedious and/or stupid with the objective of pleasing another person or group of people. If someone actually wants to bully me into doing objectively unnecessary shit I don\u2019t want to do, they\u2019re the freak, not me. At this point I\u2019m just so done taking on somebody else\u2019s hangups about my body. I\u2019ve got plenty of my own.", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 BORN WRONG"}
