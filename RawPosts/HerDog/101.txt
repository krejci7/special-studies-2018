Mea culpa. I want to apologize to all the middle-aged people whom I mocked, behind their backs, for what they did during their midlife crisis. I rolled my eyes at the $60,000 kitchen renovation with a Sub Zero refrigerator and an integrated wine storage system. I snickered at the $45,000 red Cadillac sedan with French leather seats and a Bose sound system. I said \u201cShe should have had a brain implant instead of a boob job\u201d in reference to a less than stellar co-worker who got a big cup. I take it all back. Somewhere out there someone I know is \u201ctsk-tsking\u201d me for having top surgery. It is payback. What I am doing fits the profile of a midlife crisis as much as taking skydiving lessons or buying a Harley-Davidson. Midlife can hit you hard. Particularly when you are set in your ways. Same job. Same partner. Same apartment. Same therapist. Same non-conforming butch gender stuff. And then boom, you look up and you are in uh-oh land. The land of possibilities that you did not let yourself think about every time you pulled on your Levi 501\u2019s, buttoned your L.L. Bean flannel shirt, and laced up your Timberland boots. It isn\u2019t exactly like I woke up one day and suddenly realized that I was an overweight and out of shape middle-aged butch lesbian with a stack of plaid flannel shirts and a pile of construction boots. But, after I corrected my therapist and told her \u201cI\u2019m not a girl\u201d, I started the long process of figuring out exactly what that sentence meant. While I was thinking, I started\u00a0going to Weight Watchers, ramping up my gym work outs, and binding my chest.\u00a0 Those activities are at the top of the list of warning signs of a midlife crisis. Men try to lose weight, get in shape, and take up extreme sports. Women go to plastic surgeons (Botox, liposuction, or breast enhancements). I chose from both Column A and Column B. Maybe it is just the guys I know, but it seems like midlife crisis hits men harder and they spend more dealing with it. Besides the \u201cbest fucking Cadillac ever\u201d I\u2019ve watched guys buy Crestliner fishing boats, 60-inch Samsung plasma TVs, and Rolex watches. They went for bling, so everyone else could see how cool they were. Another warning sign. They\u00a0don\u2019t want to be bald guys with beer guts any more than I do. They\u00a0want to live the good life. Even while they take out second mortgages and pension loans to do it. They want to feel good about themselves. I understand it. If you had told me ten years ago that I would be getting top surgery, I would have told you no, I\u2019m going to stay natural. I\u2019ve worked everything out, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m OK being butch. I\u2019ve made my peace with it. When I was a kid I wanted to be a boy, and I fought hard to get to where I am, and it is OK. \u00a0I do what I want, I wear what I want, I\u2019ve got a dog and a partner, I\u2019m OK. I\u2019m OK. Midlife crisis kicks in when OK is no longer enough. When you can\u2019t do the same thing over and over anymore. Somehow, in the process of repetition, it stops making sense. I was lucky. I didn\u2019t quit my job, I didn\u2019t leave Donna, I didn\u2019t go to an ashram in India, I didn\u2019t buy a convertible. I came out again. I changed my name. I lost weight. I got back in shape. I am not starting over but I am learning to be more flexible and less judgmental. And if anyone wants to make fun of me for having top surgery, then so be it. I\u2019ll be out shopping for new shirts. Notes: Surgery is still scheduled for next Monday (12/8). I\u2019ll probably take at least a week off from blogging while I recover and I\u2019m not expecting to post any \u201ctransbucket\u201d worthy photos.
