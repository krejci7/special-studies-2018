It is exactly what my dad used to say when he got up from the couch, during a commercial, for a snack. There are many facets to my gender expression. Where did they come from? How much came from my dad and my brother? How much of it did I learn\u00a0by osmosis? How much by imitation? Is any of it genuinely authentic? I adored my dad and I was envious of my brother.\u00a0My dad was squishy. He was masculine enough for a middle class Jewish man with a desk job in Manhattan. He was an avid Met\u2019s fan. He watched as many baseball games as possible. When it wasn\u2019t baseball season he talked about pitchers and catchers and spring training. He taught me how to watch the game, and, indirectly, how to talk about coaches, players, umpires, fielding strategies, rules, and stats. I still, obviously, pepper my speech with baseball idioms. My brother was a masculine enough couch potato. He watched a lot of sit-coms, drank a lot of generic cola, and listened to music while he pretended to do his homework. He was a \u00a0laid back teenager, probably because he was stoned most of the time. Once he discovered music he stopped following sports. I tried to like the music that he listened to, but I didn\u2019t. Our tastes were different. Instead, I embraced his obsession with collecting records and high-end stereo equipment. When he started drinking beer I drank his brand (Budweiser). Unfortunately, I copied his personal style, or his lack of style. Levi\u2019s, T-shirts, and plaid flannel shirts from Dave\u2019s Army Navy. I went to his barber to get my hair cut. All before I came out as butch. When I left for college my wardrobe was identical to his. Navy blue. I don\u2019t remember explicitly trying to mimic his body language and comportment, but my movements are like his movements. I resisted adults \u201ccorrecting\u201d me to take my hands out of my pockets, keep my legs together, and smile. My mother wanted to send me to etiquette lessons so that I would learn to walk and talk like a lady, but they were too expensive. She hated that I clomped around like a Clydesdale. I still don\u2019t put much thought into how I walk. I walk briskly. I don\u2019t know how other people see me, but they move out of my way on the sidewalk. I\u2019ve often wished that I looked and sounded more masculine. I\u2019ve assumed that if I took testosterone I would look and sound different, but I\u2019d be the same person I am now. I\u2019m not interested in turning into anyone else. Either way, I\u2019d still want to talk\u00a0about food, music, the Mets, queer stuff, and dogs. Either way, I\u2019d still be squishy, and masculine enough. Notes: Julia Serano writes brilliantly about being an unconventional trans woman in this\u00a0excerpt from Excluded, originally published in the Advocate,\u00a0titled Gender Is More Than Performance.
