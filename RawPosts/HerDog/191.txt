Today I was \u201cSir\u2019d\u201d while I was waiting to buy a loaf of bread at Bien Cuit. I did not correct the counter-man, and he did not apologise. Mostly I am read as female but several times a week I am read as male. I answer to either. I realize that it would be easy to be consistently\u00a0read as female.\u00a0That it is completely in my control.\u00a0 If it bothered me to be \u201cSir\u2019d\u201d\u00a0I could be\u00a0\u201cMiss\u2019d\u00a0\u201d or \u201cMa\u2019am\u2019d\u201d in an instant.\u00a0It isn\u2019t that\u00a0strangers don\u2019t pay any\u00a0attention when they look at me.\u00a0They don\u2019t see obvious female clues, so\u00a0they default to male. I don\u2019t do any of the things that women are supposed to do to look like a woman. Some people get confused because they see my gender, but they don\u2019t see my sex. Some people get angry because they think I should be easier to read. They don\u2019t like having to think. Some people hate ambiguity. In theory, I could wear earings that dangled.\u00a0Or I could wear glasses that are\u00a0feminine.\u00a0I could carry a purse.\u00a0I could tweeze\u00a0my eyebrows.\u00a0I could shave my legs. I could wear make-up.\u00a0I could wear a scarf like a woman wears it.\u00a0I could\u00a0style my hair differently.\u00a0I could wear jewelry (other than studs in my ears).\u00a0I could wear women\u2019s clothing, or a woman\u2019s winter jacket, or a woman\u2019s hat, or women\u2019s gloves.\u00a0I could color my hair. I could show cleavage.\u00a0If I did\u00a0just one of those things, if I gave just one visible clue, I\u00a0would automatically\u00a0register as\u00a0\u201cMiss\u201d.\u00a0But I am never going to do any of those things.\u00a0I am never going to make an effort to look like a girl for anyone. \u00a0I make an effort to look the way I look. I am so far down the butch bunny trail that I couldn\u2019t even remember the word that went with eyebrows (shave? thin? thread?) and I started to write \u201cwear a purse\u201d because the phrase \u201ccarry a purse\u201d is not in my vocabulary. I have to accept that it is no accident when I am \u201cSir\u2019d\u201d. I have to accept that when I look\u00a0in the mirror I want to\u00a0I read myself as \u201cnot a girl\u201d.\u00a0I have to accept that whichever way you read me, by sex or by gender, you are right.
