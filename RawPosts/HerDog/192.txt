Butch Or Trans? Battery Park City blog bus Paul Simon queer trans* transgender 
 Some days my brain is  “trans*-fixed”. Imagine my surprise as I was taking a walk through Battery Park City at lunch, thinking about the blog, and out of the corner of my eye I saw this bus. I thought “no way”. But there is always a way. Hey! That’s my bus! Apologies to Paul Simon. Hey! That’s My Bus!
