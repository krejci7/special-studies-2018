I was short and didn\u2019t fit in clothes\u00a0for my height.\u00a0Everything had to be\u00a0shortened. I popped buttons,\u00a0busted seams, and split zippers. I could not be contained by my clothes. My mother took me shopping in\u00a0the chubby department (now called girls plus). I didn\u2019t mind being a butterball, but I wanted to shop in the boy\u2019s husky section. I was rough on clothes. Especially girl\u2019s clothes. In first grade I\u00a0had a dress that was navy blue \u201cdotted swiss\u201d with red smocking\u00a0across the chest. I detested it. I accidentally dropped hot dogs on it and spilled grape juice on it. I pulled at the smocking\u00a0to snap it or stretch it out of shape. I told my mother I was clumsy. I could not outgrow that dress fast enough. I was teased at school for being fat. And for being a cry-baby. In my school\u00a0pictures I don\u2019t look obese, just pudgy. I stopped crying, but I could not stop eating. The girls\u00a0kept teasing. I liked to eat. I had an insatiable desire to eat. I supplied myself with food by using my allowance and stealing small amounts of money from my parents. On my way to school, after breakfast,\u00a0I\u2019d go to Craig\u2019s Bakery and buy a corn muffin. On my way home, I\u2019d stop\u00a0at Ess-A-Bagel, or\u00a0at Ralph\u2019s Pizzeria. On bad days\u00a0I\u2019d buy two bagels, and eat them before dinner. Some kids starve themselves to keep their breasts from growing and prevent menstruation. I was a kid who ate to suppress\u00a0my feelings and to hide my body. I didn\u2019t want to be a girl and I didn\u2019t know what to do about it, except eat and wear boy\u2019s clothing.\u00a0I also had an active fantasy life. I confused anxiety with hunger; I ate to quiet my anxiety. It is only recently that I learned to tell the difference. I numbed myself with food and then I numbed myself with alcohol. When I first let myself feel the pain of not being able to be a boy it was almost unbearable. Now I can live with it. I\u2019m no longer numb. I am also no longer fat. My BMI\u00a0is now within the \u201cnormal\u201d range for my height (5\u20194). I am learning (via Weight Watchers) how to feed myself. What combination of food, chocolate, wine, and working out allows me to maintain\u00a0a weight that\u00a0I will be comfortable at. It is embarrassing to admit that I had no idea\u00a0what physical hunger felt like or how\u00a0to satisfy it. I am gradually untangling eating and drinking\u00a0from being butch and transgender. Losing weight\u00a0will not\u00a0transform\u00a0me into a\u00a0boy anymore than gaining weight did.\u00a0It will not alleviate my dysphoria. It will not make my breasts disappear (I notice them more). Nothing I do can fix the past. Nothing can erase the pain. There is also no point in lugging\u00a0the weight\u00a0around with me, just to prove I suffered. The weight has outlived its purpose. I carried it for a long time. I don\u2019t need to hide. The title of this post comes from the Beatles song \u201cGolden Slumbers\u201d \u2013 you can hear it here.\u00a0In fantasy my\u00a0name was Paul, after the Paul McCartney of The\u00a0Beatles, circa 1964. My brother is named\u00a0Jon, so I thought it would be a good match. It wasn\u2019t until after I legally changed my name to Jamie that I realized\u00a0I had chosen exactly the same initials as my brother\u00a0\u2013 Jon Robert and Jamie Ray.
