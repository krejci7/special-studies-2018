This is the obligatory January gym post. The very first time I went to the gym I felt like Moby Dick. I was one big whale of a butch flailing around. Donna had basically told me to get my middle-aged gut to a gym and get in shape. She was worried about me because my Dad died young (43), and I take after my Dad (homely looking). Donna doesn\u2019t often ask me to do things that will make me appear more butch\u00a0so I didn\u2019t want to refuse her. I hoped that going to the gym would help me close the schism between my head and my body. That working out would make my body feel less alien. That it would cast out the demon of dysphoria. My Dad didn\u2019t play sports, didn\u2019t use power tools, didn\u2019t own a car. I am not a macho butch or a manly butch or even a gentleman butch. I am a nerdy Jewish boy butch. I am a pudgy wuss. I am just like my Dad. The second time I went to the gym I had an introductory free session with a personal trainer. It was painful. I was beet red after 5 minutes. I was out of breath. I was a 5-foot-4-inch 175 pound weakling. I returned hoping I could work out in peace and quiet without a trainer without making a total fool of myself. I bought some gym shorts. After a couple of months of lifting weights and using the elliptical, I started to look a little more like Charlie the Tuna. This was a big improvement. I was still ridiculous, I wasn\u2019t svelte, but there was hope. I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with being butch or trans*, but I am happiest in the water. I am ecstatic in the ocean. I love to swim. I\u2019d swim in a pool for exercise, but I haven\u2019t found a swimsuit I can tolerate wearing in public. Even the thought of wearing my black racerback Speedo makes me cringe. \u00a0Dysphoria is insidious. \u00a0It transforms pleasurable activities into a slog though miles of muddy swampland. I can handle gym shorts and a t-shirt, so long as I avoid the full length mirrors. When I work out, I look at myself from the shoulders up. I look at my form and not at my body. I tell myself that I am only competing against myself. It doesn\u2019t matter what anyone else is lifting. Concentrate on the on the movement and the feel of my muscles contracting not on the\u00a0size of the dumbbells or the number of plates on the bar. I remind myself that I feel good and I look better when I am working out regularly. I hold my breath every time I walk into the women\u2019s locker room, hoping no one tries to stop me. My personal weight lifting goal is to feel like\u00a0Flipper, the bottlenose dolphin who effortlessly jumps up in the air and then dives down into the water. Who laughs and swims and is friends with Sandy and Bud. If I worked out more, I could be as graceful as Flipper. Therein lies the problem. My roles models are fish. \u00a0Male fish (technically marine mammals). Flipper Searching for Jamie Ray \u00a0 ", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
