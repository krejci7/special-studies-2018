The Cardiologist listened to my heart with a stethoscope, took an EKG, looked at my blood work, asked me some questions about my exercise and diet, and asked about the circumstances of my parents\u2019 deaths. I walked out with a prescription for low\u00a0dose Atorvastatin (20mg once a week to lower my cholesterol) and a follow-up appointment in May. He also gave me the green light for going on testosterone.\u00a0He said that if I thought I\u2019d be overall happier and healthier on testosterone then I should start taking it and we\u2019d watch and manage my cholesterol.\u00a0I should be ecstatic; my cholesterol was the only medical obstacle to starting testosterone. Instead, it sent me into another confused tailspin. I talked to my Nurse Practitioner at Callen-Lorde. She offered to write me a prescription for testosterone and I told her I wanted to wait. She said to call her when I was ready. My next appointment isn\u2019t until September. Putting off taking taking testosterone feels different than saying \u201cI\u2019ve decided not to go on it.\u201d Even if the outcome is the same. When I think about never going on testosterone, I get very sad. Crying sad. Raging at the unfairness sad. It lets loose all of\u00a0my childhood denial. I\u2019m not really a girl, I can\u2019t really be a girl, there has got to be a fix for this, I\u2019m really a boy, and someday I\u2019m going to turn into one. Somewhere in there I still have hope, even though nothing short of a time travel machine can turn me back into a boy. Starting testosterone won\u2019t do it; it will make me look and sound like a man. My reasons for wanting to start are straight forward. If I don\u2019t try it then I will never know if it is the right thing for me to do. If I don\u2019t like it, I can stop and call it quits. I want it to lower my voice. I want it to make people stop Ma\u2019aming me. I want it to nudge me along. My reasons for refraining are also simple. I might not like how I masculinize. Donna might not like how I masculinize. I will have a lot of explaining to do as I change, and I\u2019m not sure what to say about it. The rest is complicated. I am afraid of too much too fast. I like my face. I don\u2019t know how it will change. When I look at trans men\u2019s before and after pictures, I don\u2019t always prefer the after picture. Some guys lose their softness and their youthfulness. I\u2019m not keen on growing a lot of body or facial hair. I don\u2019t want to go bald. I\u2019m already hairy, and the men in my family are hairy. Except on the top of their head. I\u2019m afraid of gaining weight and bulking up. It took a lot of effort for me to get my weight down to where it is and I don\u2019t want to get husky again. I\u2019m afraid of busting out of the custom-made shirts I bought after I had top-surgery. I have not found any research on the recommended dosage for post menopausal administration of testosterone or for low dose testosterone. Callen-Lorde follows the Endocrine Society\u2019s\u00a0guidelines (start with biweekly injections of .5cc (100mg) of 200mg/ml testosterone and increase to 1.0 cc biweekly). This is also the document used by WPATH. It does not take age or estrogen levels into account. If I started, I would start somewhat lower, and probably with Androgel. I do not know how to get past the sadness and the anger. I do not know if the pain of not being a boy translates into desiring\u00a0to be a man, or to be seen as a man. I\u2019m content being seen as non-binary, but no one sees me that way. Testosterone is an effective way to change that. Testosterone will not turn me into a man anymore than estrogen made me into a woman. Meanwhile, I\u2019m staying in the middle. Notes: This post by Dr. Cary Gabriel Costello, from his blog TransFusion, critiques biological and hormonal essentialism in the trans community. He also has a good analysis on why trans men \u201cpass\u201d more easily than trans women, and it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with height or shoulder width.
