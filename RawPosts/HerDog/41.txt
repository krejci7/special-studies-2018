For years, in-between puberty and top surgery, I hated my breasts (and my hips). \u00a0I didn\u2019t know the word for dysphoria but I experienced it. I had a lot of body shame. Now, when I take my morning shower and get dressed, I give thanks for my top surgery. But my chest is not what defines me as trans. I am tired of seeing articles (popping up in my Facebook feed) that feature some variation of hot young trans guys without their shirts on. I\u2019m put off by the media obsession with trans men who have chests as sexy as sexy cisgender men\u2019s chests. I\u2019m put off by the search for the perfect trans chest. For trans torsos with a narrow V shape. For trans chests with no visible surgical scars or dog ears. For trans models with small nipples and chiseled abs. For guys who are young, ripped, and (usually) white. Articles about trans men that show them going shirtless (or in boxer shorts injecting testosterone) are as obnoxious as\u00a0articles about trans women that show them putting on their make-up. We are more than our surgeries. We are more than our make up. We need to see the widest range of trans possibilities, not just the ones that reinforce the stereotypes. I\u2019m not going to exchange my dysphoria for the muscled hypermasculinity that dominates the media (or the svelte androgyny that is used to represent genderqueer). I want to look like myself, but comfortable, and with a nice, flat, masculinized chest. I haven\u2019t posted pictures of my chest on my blog. I don\u2019t want them up there for everyone to see.\u00a0My chest is fine, but not fabulous. My revision scars are still healing and my pecs aren\u2019t exactly even (they are even enough). I have emailed pictures of my chest, and taken my shirt off, to show my results to a couple of people who were thinking about going to Dr. Weiss. I saw a lot of trans chests at the \u201cshow and tell\u201d workshops at the Philadelphia Trans Health Conference.\u00a0Many of them are a little funky looking. There are a wide range of idiosyncratic trans chests (and cis chests) out there, including mine. I have no shame about my chest (particularly after getting my nipples reduced/resized) but I still compare it to other people\u2019s chests. I caught myself judging an actor\u2019s chest at the movies this weekend (Elmer B\u00e4ck in Eisenstein in Guanajuato), and asking myself if I\u2019d be content if I had his nipples (I like mine better). In real life, the only time my shirt comes off in public is when I\u2019m changing in the locker room at the gym.\u00a0In another life, my shirt would also come off at\u00a0the beach or by a pool. I can\u2019t think of any other situations when I\u2019d want to go shirtless.\u00a0I understand why some trans guys post shirtless selfies, but no matter how cool my chest looks, I spend almost all my waking time wearing a shirt. So does everyone else I know. I\u2019d rather look at guys with their clothes on.\u00a0And the truth is, I haven\u2019t met anyone whose top surgery doesn\u2019t look great when they are wearing a nice shirt. Notes: This article \u201c16 Trans Men Who Don\u2019t Own A Shirt\u201d, \u00a0kept showing up in my Facebook feed last week, as did this article \u201cMeet the First Trans Man on the Cover of Men\u2019s Health in Europe\u201c. Both offer a hypermasculine approach to chests. A more realistic peek at what three different trans chests look like is in Davey Wavey\u2019s video \u201cTransgender Men Get Shirtless\u201d which also has a link to this video on nipples by Ryan Cassata with Davey Wavey.
