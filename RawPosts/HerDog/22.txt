He very nicely told me how grateful he was that I had come back to work in the subway schedules department, and how I had provided invaluable assistance to the staff by trouble shooting their software problems\u00a0 (the important, but unofficial, part of my old job). After I agreed to one more year, he told me that he was very busy and asked me to write the memorandum to request that the\u00a0state Board of Ethics grant me another waiver so that I could continue working. In theory, writing the memo was no big deal. One paragraph stating why they hired me back in the first place, the second paragraph with a flowery description of what I\u2019ve done for the department, the third paragraph outlining what they expect me to do in the next year (oversee the installation of a new proprietary software program), and the fourth paragraph closing with why it is important that the contract be extended. Standard bureaucratic drivel. When I was in charge of the department, I wrote a hundred similar memo\u2019s to HR to hire and promote managers. The memos were slightly formal and stilted. I got hung up on the first sentence. The one that started with \u201cThe purpose of this memorandum is to request that Ms. Jamie Ray\u2019s Contingent Temporary Employee contract be extended for an additional year.\u201d Four paragraphs of writing about myself in the third person with Ms. and she used collectively eleven times. It was a strong and convincing memo, but it sounded off-key to me. I\u2019m not that person any longer. I don\u2019t think of myself as she or her or Ms. I copied the text into a new document and tried to tone down the gender references. I realized that this was not the right time to change pronouns and honorifics at work. If I am going to do it I need to do it the same way I changed my name. I need to talk to my closest co-workers and my boss, ask for their support, and then let everyone else know and hold them to it. It isn\u2019t good form to ask my boss to sign out a memo, under his name, using Mx. and they, if I\u2019m not already using gender neutral pronouns and honorifics in the office. I substituted they or Jamie seven times, and I left in two Ms. and two shes. One in each paragraph. It flew under his radar and he signed it out. The last time this specific problem came up was over two years ago, when I drafted the \u201ctherapist\u2019s letter\u201d for Dr. Weiss for my top surgery and ended up using she and her (but not Ms.). I am merely annoyed by other people referring to me as she/her, but it is torture for me to do it to myself. I\u2019m not doing it again. I never think or talk about myself in the third person.\u00a0 I don\u2019t use or select Ms. on address forms. Thankfully, first person pronouns are not gendered, except in a very small handful of languages (including Thai and Welsh). I\u2019m happy referring to myself with Jamie, me, I, my, and mine. Outside of trans spaces, I\u2019m still reluctant to ask anyone to use they/them pronouns for me. I don\u2019t have a good answer when I\u2019m asked what my pronouns are. I\u2019m likely to say that I prefer they/them, then hedge it by saying that most of the people in my life use she/her. I don\u2019t feel entitled to make a fuss about it. It is as if I\u2019ve tethered new pronouns to taking testosterone (what is the point of using they/them if I\u2019m not on T). Increasingly, however, it feels contradictory for me to come out as trans while tolerating she/her pronouns. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m headed for he/him, but I don\u2019t think I can tolerate she/her forever. Notes: While using gender neutral pronouns has been in the news a lot, I could not find anything regarding using they/them/their pronouns in business writing, e.g. resumes, CV\u2019s, and professional bios. I did, however, find a great article by Dennis Baron called \u201cThe Words that Failed: A chronology of early nonbinary pronouns\u201c. I last wrote about this issue in an alarmingly similar way about two years ago in a post titled \u201cGrammar, Preferred Gender Pronouns, and I\u201c. It also references an article by Dennis Baron.
