I am surfing the internet for swimsuits. Gracie is curled up on the floor in a patch of late afternoon sunlight. I\u2019d like to know what she is dreaming about. I have the perfect wardrobe for January; for 12 inches of snow, slush moats, and arctic windchill. I\u2019ve got high-tech long underwear, three different types of fleece jackets, a down sweater and a down jacket, lightweight and heavy weight Gore-Tex shells, boot socks, \u00a0windproof gloves and\u00a0moisture wicking\u00a0glove liners, neck gaiters, wool beanies, and insulated waterproof work boots. I can mix and match for any\u00a0 winter weather condition. If you wanted to throw an outdoor party in January I\u2019d have the\u00a0ideal outfit. I\u2019m an urban slumberjack. Last year I waited until June to think about swimming. I swore it would be the last season that I\u2019d wear a black racerback Speedo in the water, topped by a pair of quick-dry shorts and a damp T-shirt on the sand. A black racerback is the butch equivalent of a little black dress. It is elegant and understated, but I don\u2019t wear dresses.\u00a0I promised myself\u00a0to start looking for genderqueer appropriate beach wear in January. This is my 2014 swimsuit challenge. Layers work great in January but are less appealing in June. It is\u00a0my conundrum. My winter wardrobe hides my femaleness; a swimsuit exposes every last bit of it. Jamie, are you ready for a pool party? I\u2019ve lost about 30 pounds since I bought my Speedo. Speedos are stretchy but they only contract so much. I need to replace my size 16 with\u00a0something smaller.\u00a0I went to swimoutlet.com and looked at racing suits,\u00a0triathlon suits, and swim unitards. I am concerned that the unitard will accentuate my curves. I am afraid I will\u00a0look like a sumo wrestler in\u00a0it. If I try hard enough, I can morph my Speedo into a men\u2019s swimsuit from the 1920\u2019s. Until the early 1930\u2019s\u00a0it was considered obscene for men to bare their chests in public, even at the beach. Public ordinances prohibited it.\u00a0 Men were arrested and fined for exposing their nipples\u00a0and their belly buttons. Psychologically, I\u2019d rather wear men\u2019s gear. It would keep me from feeling like a conservative matron. Realistically, there are limits.\u00a0I\u2019ve ordered some board shorts from Patagonia. I\u2019m in the anticipatory stage where they haven\u2019t arrived yet, so they are the perfect solution. The problem is what to wear on top. I\u2019m not interested in showing flesh; I\u2019m thinking about a rash guard. The sentence that aches to be written is \u201cI can\u2019t do that until I have top surgery.\u201d I can try\u00a0a sports bra or a swimsuit under the rash guard. It is OK if I look like a self-conscious queer. At least the rash guard will be rated UPF-50 and I won\u2019t get sunburned on my shoulders. I discovered that I am not the only person who is confused about what to wear under my imaginary board shorts.\u00a0There is a surfing controversy between going commando and wearing some form of boxers or briefs. The commando cons are sand, board wax, and sea lice in your junk, and leaving nothing to the imagination. The layered look cons are feeling like you are wearing a wet diaper under your board shorts, showing panty-lines, and having\u00a0your underwear band peek out over the rim. I\u2019ll have to take a bath in them and see how they look. And then pretend that surf\u2019s up. Update: I never went swimming in 2014, but you can read about my purchases of swimming binders, genderqueer swimsuits, and butch friendly swimsuits and compression tops in my 2015 post here.  Note: Here are two short picturesque articles on the history of\u00a0men\u2019s\u00a0and\u00a0women\u2019s\u00a0swimsuits, and the fight for the right to bare arms.
