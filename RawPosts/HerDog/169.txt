I cleaned out my closet. I also cleaned out my dresser drawers. I dumped everything out onto the floor.\u00a0I kept all the clothes that I like in my current size and one size up. I gave away the rest. I am temporarily liberated from clothing I don\u2019t like and won\u2019t wear. I have space to spare.\u00a0I threw out two bags of old clothes; three bags of practically new clothing went to the Housing Works Thrift Shop. I\u2019ve done this before.  I sorted through an immense pile of Levi\u2019s ranging from size 32 through 38 inches. Each incremental size in multiple colors and washes. I tossed \u201cwork clothes\u201d in sizes 12, 14, and 16 petite. I weeded out a dozen turtlenecks that I can\u2019t wear because they give me hot flashes. I eliminated T-shirts in colors that don\u2019t look good on me (lemon yellow, chartruese, baby blue). New Yorkers are used to living in small apartments with insufficient closets. We don\u2019t have basements and we don\u2019t have attics. There are three approaches that we take; live like a monk, create unique storage spaces, or live like the Collyer Brothers. Neat freaks tend to go for the first two approaches. They build floor-to-ceiling bookcases in their hallways, buy fancy storage systems for their closets, and put rolling drawers under their beds. Clutterers go for option three. I stack my books sideways and two deep, stuff my sweaters onto\u00a0 overflowing closet shelves, cram my T-shirts into drawers, and avoid doing my laundry because I have no place to put it once it is folded. Clutterers are recidivists. We make the same mistakes year after year. I periodically purged my closet of women\u2019s clothing, but it kept creeping back in. There was a wedding, or a funeral, or a conference I needed to go to. I bought a blouse, wore it once, and put it back on a hanger in the closet. I once made a list of combinations of pants, shirts, and sweaters to wear to work.\u00a0In the\u00a0morning I put on the next outfit, and worked my way down the list until it was time to go to the dry cleaners and do the laundry. I refused to look in a mirror. I felt false. I tucked a pair of\u00a0 jeans in my pack so I could change after work. I want to believe that dressing butch is a conscious fashion choice. It would be nice to\u00a0shift out of casual butch-mode when the occasion requires it and slip into something else. I can\u2019t do it. I still think there is something wrong with me for being unable to do \u201cit\u201d. I still have shame. I do not want clothing to have that kind of power over me. I do not want to accept that I am incompetent at getting dressed like an adult woman. I do not want to accept what the acuteness of my dysphoria means. I want to believe that I don\u2019t like dressing up; I do not want to accept that I can not do it. That I can not outgrow myself. It is hard for me to accept failure, to accept that I have my limits. I expect to be able to do whatever I set out to do. I am persistent and stubborn. I do my research. I like to figure out puzzles. I like to solve problems. I am giving up. I am throwing in the towel. It is going to the Housing Works Thrift Shop. ", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
