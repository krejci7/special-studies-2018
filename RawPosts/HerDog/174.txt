Gracie\u00a0expects to walk down to 11th Street in the morning and she expects to go to the dog run before dinner. At night, she expects me to play \u201ctricks for treats\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0She expects a rawhide swizzle stick after the last walk, and she expects to be invited up for a snuggle right before I go to sleep. If I try to skip a routine because it is late, or because I am tired, she sits and gives me a withering look. She whines. She is a willful little bitch. The last time I counted, we had over twenty daily routines. I will not list them. She keeps track. Dogs like consistency. If you asked Gracie what she wanted to do tonight, she would probably reply \u201cThe usual.\u201d I\u00a0enjoy Gracie\u2019s routines.\u00a0They are a form of intimacy.\u00a0I\u00a0love her enthusiasm for giving me high-fives. I like how she \u00a0pulls me to the right at the corner of Horatio and Washington because it it time to go to the dog run. Gracie and I understand each other. We know what makes each other tick. There is great comfort in being known, even if it is by a dog. I don\u2019t have to explain myself. I don\u2019t have to make excuses. I don\u2019t have to pretend to be someone else. I can stick to the routine. It is a good thing that I have Gracie, because Donna chafes at routine. She claims\u00a0that a routine is a\u00a0good starting point. Having a routine helps to keep\u00a0her organized, but\u00a0she does not want to be constrained or\u00a0governed by it.\u00a0Donna is always thinking about how to improve the itinerary, by either deviating from it or adding to it. As soon as I adjust to a plan, she changes it. She likes spontaneity. She aspires to be a free-spirit. She always wants to hear the specials in a restaurant. I am a person who\u00a0cleaves to\u00a0routine. I like that\u00a0the barista knows me as \u201cgrande dark roast\u00a0in a personal cup\u201d\u00a0and that the waiter at the Japanese restaurant knows\u00a0me as \u00a0\u201csushi deluxe, salad, Asahi Super Dry beer.\u201d I like that they acknowledge my existence, even if they don\u2019t know\u00a0me by\u00a0name. Still, they see me as something more than my appearance. Being butch and trans*\u00a0is at odds with the heteronormative world; the familiarity of routine evens out the score. A woman in the locker room was staring at my hairy legs (and the neon-green striped boxer briefs I forgot I was wearing). I reminded myself that the trainers and staff know me, my form is good, and I know I belong there, hairy legs and all. Thursday at 5:00 P.M. is my gym time. I\u2019m willing to share it with others. When I was in my twenties I wanted to be invisible. I preferred places that were impersonal, grab and go. I avoided situations that required asking for assistance. I did not want to deal with a bank teller, or a delicatessen counterman, or a hardware store clerk. I did not want to be on a first name basis with the cheesemonger at Murray\u2019s. I\u2019ve changed. I still feel a little tension going into a new place; are they going to have an attitude?\u00a0I like patronizing shops and restaurants where I don\u2019t have to worry about how I look or how I sound or what the proprietor is going to call me. It isn\u2019t about being a big shot or jumping the queue or getting\u00a0the red-carpet\u00a0treatment. Being a regular takes the sting out of being gender non-conforming. I can be queer and normal at the same time. It is comforting to have someone ask \u201cThe usual?\u201d and to be able to answer \u201cYes.\u201d ", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
