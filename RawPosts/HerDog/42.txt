I did not want to look like Barbra Streisand. I wanted to look like Paul McCartney. The pixie cut was meant to \u201cfix\u201d the haircut that I gave myself with ordinary scissors. I wanted a \u201cBeatle mop cut\u201d but mostly I wanted to cut off my hair. I was still hoping that a hair cut could turn me into a boy. My father adored me. My father adored Streisand. She was a poor, big nosed, Jewish girl from Brooklyn who made it big. She was a star. I didn\u2019t want to be a star. I didn\u2019t want a girl\u2019s nick-name. I didn\u2019t like girlish diminutives or terms of endearment. I especially hated when my Grandmother called me Ameleh or Feygele; the former the Yiddishification of my birth name, the latter Yiddish for little bird. Years before I changed my name I forbid anyone to call me Ameleh or Feygele. I cringed at the sound. I didn\u2019t want any part of being either. Barbra as Anshel in Yentl I didn\u2019t see the movie Yentl (the 1983 musical, which Streisand produced, directed, re-wrote, and starred in).\u00a0I remember seeing the trailers and thinking that Barbra Streisand looked way too much like Barbra Streisand. She didn\u2019t look like a yeshiva boy to me. Her hair was still in a kind of pixie cut. The movie Yentl\u00a0is based on Isaac Bashevis Singer\u2019s short story Yentl the Yeshiva Boy. I\u2019ve read the story. Yentl is the rabbi\u2019s daughter, who, after her father\u2019s death, cuts her hair, puts on men\u2019s clothing, leaves town, changes her name to Anshel, and goes to study in a yeshiva. Anshel falls in love with Avigdor, another yeshiva boy (there is a complicated love triangle with Anshel being married off to Avigdor\u2019s ex-fiance), and eventually Anshel confesses to Avigdor that he is a woman, not a man. Instead of living as a woman with Avigdor, Anshel deserts his wife and runs away again, to study in another town. Singer\u2019s ending is unresolved; I was left wondering what Anshel\u2019s life will be like, how many more times will he have to run away. Streisand changed the ending; Anshel reverts back to Yentl and gets on a boat bound for America. The movie makes a feminist statement, but the original story is a transgender tragedy. Yentl the Yeshiva Boy made me question what I would have done in Anshel\u2019s place. I can\u2019t picture myself going stealth or wearing a yarmulke and a shtreimel. Many years ago, in a misguided attempt to improve my style, I bought a black wool beret. When Donna saw me wearing it, she laughed, and said \u201cYou look just like Fernandel!\u201d I would have preferred a comparison to a more debonair actor, but I am still much happier to be Donna\u2019s Fernandel than her Barbra. Fernandel Notes: Fernandel was a French comic actor, starring in films from the 1930\u2019s through the 1960\u2019s. He was famous for his wide horse-teeth smile and his large nose. Yentl the Yeshiva Boy was published in Commentary magazine in 1962, you can read it here. The word feygele (little bird) is also slang for fairy or fag. The English words came first; the Yiddish usage is American, not old country. It was probably coined because of the phonetic connection. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
