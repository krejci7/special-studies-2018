This created a controversy. Everyone has their own ideas about what a stone butch is. All negative. And they didn\u2019t include me. Butch, no argument, but not stone. That is because I am, and aways have been, a big softy. A big hugger, a big kisser, and a big cuddler. I\u2019m sweet and I\u2019m considerate. With humans and with dogs. I just don\u2019t like taking my clothes off or having my \u201cgirl\u201d parts fiddled with. Stone butch sounds hard and immovable. Stone butch sounds cold and rough. It isn\u2019t. I\u2019m not made out of bedrock. I am a butch with contradictions. I am a butch with limits. Some labels are too hard, some labels are too soft, and none of them feels just right. Not even the little bear\u2019s. I don\u2019t require my own special seat at the gender table. I don\u2019t want to be corralled into the polygon sliver within the overlapping circles of lesbian, butch, transgender, queer, neutrois, genderqueer, androgynous, agender, tomboy, and transmasculine. Nor do I want to define myself by the empty space left over after eliminating what I am not: cisgender, straight, polyamorous, bisexual, transsexual, trans man, or ftm. I would like to be able to explain myself in one sentence that anyone can understand and relate to. I don\u2019t like using labels to exclude people. I was excluded for being odd, weird, different, queer, and awkward. An introverted tomboy. I was only included in social activities when I was bullied; otherwise I was shunned. I was the kid with the cooties from kindergarten through 6th grade.\u00a0That wasn\u2019t how I identified; it was branded onto me by the other kids at P.S. 40, Manhattan. There was no escaping it. I am wary of labels and categories that are applied by outsiders, even if they mean well. I do not want to be narrowly defined by the medical or psychiatric establishment.\u00a0I don\u2019t want to be patronized. I don\u2019t wan to be pathologized. When I tell someone I\u2019m transgender, they may think that I just started to transition, or that I\u2019m not very convincing. I don\u2019t look \u201ctrans enough\u201d to them. They are not interested in how I think about myself and where I place myself on the gender spectrum. They ask if I am on testosterone and if I\u2019ve had surgery. When I tell someone I\u2019m butch, they see a masculine woman who fits their stereotype of what a lesbian looks like. They see me as \u201cbutch enough.\u201d They are not interested in how I think about myself. If\u00a0I state that butch and transgender do not have to be mutually exclusive then I need to be prepared for the Spanish Inquisition. From all sides. Below are a few low jargon, nonjudgmental, and grammatically awkward ways to describe me:  I always wanted to be a boy and to wear boy\u2019s/men\u2019s clothes, and I\u2019ve always been attracted to women. I\u2019ve never been, or wanted to be, feminine and I lean towards the masculine. The women I\u2019ve been attracted to are warm and earthy. I\u2019m not comfortable being a girl/woman, yet I am not convinced that becoming a man would make me happier. I am in a good long-term relationship with Donna and I want to keep it that way, even if I have to make compromises. I am happiest in the company of dogs and women (especially Gracie and Donna).  CN Lester and Sophia Banks have started a project called Songs Of Ourselves. Their mission is to provide a place where \u201cI allow myself to be who I know myself to be\u201d. \u00a0It is worth checking out, and if you identify as trans you may want to consider adding yourself into their mix.
