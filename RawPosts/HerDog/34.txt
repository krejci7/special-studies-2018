The second best answer was a doctor, a lawyer, or a rocket scientist (or more realistically a nurse, a librarian, or a teacher). I knew not to answer a baseball player, a fireman, or a cowboy. I didn\u2019t know what happened to kids like me, but I wasn\u2019t ever going to be a wife and a mother. To be safe, I said I wanted to be a lawyer (we watched Perry Mason on TV). Then I read The Fountainhead in high school and decided to become an architect. It was all based on image, not innate skill. I didn\u2019t question why all my role models were men. Highway engineer in Nebraska, 1960. I enrolled in an architecture program but I was no Howard Roark. I was too sloppy to pass the introductory drafting class. I transferred to civil engineering because it had a promising job board. I pictured myself on a construction site wearing Carhartt canvas pants and Red Wing boots. I aced my classes.\u00a0I also came out as butch. It was the first identity that I could identify with. It seemed natural, as if it had been waiting for me all along. The term butch only came into usage in the 1940\u2019s. Regardless of the label, the religious, legal, medical, and psychiatric authorities have pathologized, criminalized, and demonized people like me since they realized we existed. I say people like me, because even though we\u2019ve been around forever, the words used to describe us keep evolving. The bigotry seems to stay the same.\u00a0 Since biblical times, words existed for the sexual acts between people of the same-sex (e.g. sodomy, buggery, or tribadism), but until the mid 1800\u2019s there were few words to specifically identify the kinds of people who committed these acts. The terms homosexual and heterosexual were first published in 1880 (by K\u00e1roly M\u00e1ria Kertbeny). Transvestite was used by Magnus Hirschfeld in 1910, and transsexual in 1949 by David Oliver Cauldwell. I\u2019ve never identified with any of those terms. I don\u2019t know what choices I would have made if butch didn\u2019t exist. Would I invent it? Would I go\u00a0underground and try to pass as a man? Wear women\u2019s clothing in public, but dress as a man at home? Cohabit in a Boston Marriage? Join a religious order? Suppress everything and marry a man? Have romantic friendships? Would I be institutionalized? Would I try to kill myself? I do not judge those who came before me. Una Troubridge and Radclyffe Hall and two Dachsunds. They lived quietly and did not write books about how they lived their lives (Radclyffe Hall being one of the exceptions). What was reported in the press, after their death or discovery, was often lurid or prurient. We do not know their true gender identities and sexual identities. I don\u2019t want to appropriate their stories or retroactively try to fit 21st century labels onto them, but I can picture myself in their boots. Slang and labels come into fashion and go out of fashion. It is difficult to write about myself without using my 2016 vocabulary. Today, I\u2019d say I was assigned female at birth (AFAB) but identify as queer, non-binary, and transgender or as a transmasculine butch. I use labels, but I believe in the whole spectrum, not just my little part of it. I don\u2019t let labels dictate what I can or can\u2019t do. Labels helped me untangle the confusing mess of my gender and sexuality. Labels help us find our niche. Labels help us organize and come together to fight for our rights, to defeat the bigots, and live to tell the story. Notes: I was thinking\u00a0about how fast terminology changes when I read Shawn\u2019s\u00a0post on labels last week. I started looking for timelines of what terms were used when, and instead found this interesting summary of terms in the OED (The Oxford English Dictionary) for women who have sex with women. Lastly, I was looking for some information on \u201cBoston Marriages\u201d and found this article in The Atlantic on 19th century friendships (But Were They Gay?).
