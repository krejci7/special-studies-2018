The big reveal. Frankenstein\u2019s monster, 1931. The thermometer hit 80\u00baF (27\u00baC) in New York this week. It is T-shirt season. This is the first week I\u2019ve been out in public wearing just one thin clingy layer. Me, my nipples, and my dog. I like the contour of my chest in a T-shirt. I like the definition; clavicle, sternum, pecs, and nipples. It looks like a male chest attached to a short and not-quite-so male torso. Last summer I wore a heavy T-shirt over my binder. I didn\u2019t want the binder\u2019s outline to show. I have not\u00a0figured out how I want my T-shirts to fit. I\u2019m not sure what is too tight around the chest, what is too loose, what is just right. Where the sleeve should hit my bicep. How the bottom should hug my waist. After years of being overweight, I lean towards loose. I\u2019ve bought and/or returned a dozen different T-shirts. The one thing they have in common is you can see my nipple bumps.\u00a0I\u2019ve kept a boy\u2019s XL from Lands End, a men\u2019s S from Uniqlo, and a men\u2019s M from Bonobos. My nipples are prominent. My shirts feel oddly transparent. Prior to top surgery my nipples were\u00a0invisible; smoothed over by sports bras and binders. Women\u2019s nipples are supposed to stay hidden. The last time it was fashionable for women to poke through a sweater was in the 1950\u2019s, when bullet bras were popular. Even now, magazines routinely airbrush out all evidence of nipples. Even on male models. When I go out walking I discretely eye men in T-shirts to see whether their nipples show.\u00a0I\u2019m not cruising. I used to work with a guy who never looked women in the eye; he only looked at the headlamps. I\u2019m afraid of turning into him. I\u2019ve confirmed that it is common for a man\u2019s nipples to protrude. It is less noticeable when the T-shirt is loose, has graphics or stripes, or is a dark color. Nipples are more visible on guys who are husky, out of shape, and middle-aged, but some young rail thin guys sport them. Nipples are normal. My surgeon, Dr. Weiss, asked me, at one of my follow-up appointments, how I felt about my chest. Overall, I\u2019m very happy with it, even though my scars look like they belong on Frankenstein\u2019s monster. There is still a small pucker around the incision on the left side. Dr. Weiss noticed it after the bandages came off and was waiting to see whether it settled in. He will fix it in the office, without charge, after the summer is over. The other lumps and bumps disappeared. No dog ears on the sides. He asked me if I was OK with my nipples. Dr. Weiss does double incision top surgery with pedicle preservation. Instead of doing a nipple graft, he leaves the areolae and nipples attached to the stem but reduces the size of the areolae. Compared to a standard male chest, my areolae are a little large (roughly the size of a Quarter coin), and my nipples are proportionately big and perky. Despite their size, the placement is good and they look like they belong there. They are familiar. I don\u2019t need to reduce, move, or adjust them; someone else might feel differently. My nipples don\u2019t have\u00a0to be perfect. I\u2019m glad I had top surgery. I like the way I look in a T-shirt, even with the bumps. I might try going one size smaller next time I\u2019m shopping. I\u2019m reclaiming my right to present as masculinely as I want to. I\u2019m down to one layer, and at least to me, my chest looks great. Notes: For models without nipples, here is an article from New York Magazine on how Rolling Stone Magazine edits and alters cover photos. And when you just can\u2019t stand to look at one more airbrushed model, and you want to see what real butch, femme, queer, transgender, and/or non-binary people look like (and which catch phrase they use for themselves) you can look at this gallery of photos from The Identity Project (photographed by Sarah Deragon). \u00a0And at Meg Allen\u2019s BUTCH gallery, or buy a copy of Wendi Kali\u2019s book The Butch/Femme Photo Project.
