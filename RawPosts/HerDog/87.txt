I let it pile up. From December until now. Three big piles. Roy Rogers and his mail. I think Bullet (his dog) is under there somewhere. I have a secret streak of irresponsibility and procrastination. When it surfaces I know something is going on. Years ago, I procrastinated filing my taxes. One year, then two, then I stopped opening the letters until the IRS took the money out of my bank account. The weird thing was, if I\u2019d filed on time,\u00a0I would have gotten a small refund. Instead, I had to pay a penalty and hire a CPA to straighten the mess out. All the forms I need to file my 2014 taxes are in those piles, and whichever ones aren\u2019t, I\u2019m going to have to track down on-line. I should\u00a0make an appointment with my accountant. I have phone anxiety. If I don\u2019t call now I could procrastinate for another five years, paralyzed by shame. Like a bad child on my way to the principal\u2019s office, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here again. Telling a procrastinator to just do it is about as effective as telling an overweight person to use willpower or a depressed person to cheer up. I muster up my adult self,\u00a0pick up the phone, and place the call. I know I won\u2019t blow off the appointment. I will come\u00a0prepared because I don\u2019t want to look like an idiot. I want to look like a responsible adult, even if I feel like a terrified child. I\u2019m afraid of backsliding and screwing up my finances again. Of starting a costly self-perpetuating cycle of anxiety, avoidance, and shame. This is a part of me that I hate.\u00a0I\u2019m also afraid of gaining back weight; the visible manifestation that I\u2019m out of control\u00a0and that something is wrong. I could lose my grip and be round again. Or be eleven years old, chubby, wearing clothes I hate, stealing money from my parents to buy muffins from the bakery, and stuffing the muffins down to steady myself, bewildered but unable to stop. Two things my mother harped on were my weight and that I was never going to be successful or be able to support myself (since I obviously wasn\u2019t going to get married and no one would hire someone who looked like me). It is impossible to get those dead arguments out of my head, no matter how many times I prove her wrong. It is no accident that this is happening just as I am starting to feel good about my body. The procrastination and bingeing are warnings. The eleven year old is banging at the cellar door trying to get out. I don\u2019t know what to do with her. I want to tell her that her mother is wrong. It is OK that you don\u2019t want to grow up. There will come a time when you won\u2019t have breasts, and you won\u2019t have to wear anything that makes you look like a woman. You will have a nice chest and you will put on a T-shirt with nothing on underneath it. You won\u2019t have to stuff your feelings down, you will be able to feel the pain and it will hurt but you will survive. It won\u2019t be easy, but you will stop stuffing down bagels and you will pay your taxes on time. And you will feel better. I promise. Notes: Roy Rogers is remembered for his horse Trigger, but he also had a trusty canine companion, Bullet. Bullet was known to rescue him from some pretty difficult circumstances. Unfortunately, Gracie can not help me open the mail or file my taxes. I can\u2019t even take her off as a deduction. This article from The New Yorker (although neither butch nor trans* related) is a good piece on procrastination. A lot of us complain about being paralyzed by procrastination, putting off all sorts of things until we get our act together. I\u2019m trying to break the cycle.
