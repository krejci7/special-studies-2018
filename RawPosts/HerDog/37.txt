Back then, I was one of those kids you could spot a mile away and say \u201cShe\u2019s going to be a lesbian when she grows up.\u201d Now, you\u2019d probably say \u201cThat kid is going to transition as soon as they can.\u201d I\u2019ve never been able to hide it. I never tried to look \u201cnormal\u201d. I didn\u2019t know that I was trying to manage my dysphoria, I just knew that I wanted to look like a boy. I knew that every compromise hurt. All through elementary school I wore dresses to school because it was \u201cthe law\u201d. I wore the least feminine dress possible, but a dress is a dress, even if it is olive drab. Putting a dress on felt like a punishment for waking up. I swore that when I grew up I wouldn\u2019t get married, have kids, or ever wear a dress. I said I was a tomboy, and that I didn\u2019t mind being a girl. I claimed that I wanted to wear boy\u2019s clothing and sneakers because they were comfortable and practical. I didn\u2019t tell anyone that I wanted to be a boy, or that I was a boy.\u00a0No one wanted to hear the truth, even though it was obvious. I repeated versions of that lie right through my adolescence and into adulthood. The olive drab dress gave way to jeans and a flannel shirt. When I came out, I liked that I was visibly, recognizably, butch. What was once a problem was now a solution. I went from being an outcast to being part of a community. Then I got my first professional job and had to find something to wear to work.\u00a0I never got used to wearing women\u2019s clothes for work, no matter how man-tailored the cut. I expected to find a fashion solution I could live with, but I didn\u2019t. There was no official dress code, but only a couple of managers wore jeans in the office. The ones who did were men. Every morning I had trouble getting myself dressed and out the door. I hated wearing office drag. I started wearing jeans to work. I could tell my boss wasn\u2019t happy\u00a0about it, but he didn\u2019t say anything directly to me. There is no queer way to dress for success. For me, being visibly queer is different from looking androgynous. Androgynous seems smooth, slender, and glossy. Flowing, elegant, socially acceptable, and almost pretty. I can\u2019t pull that off. Queer seems more in your face. Androgynous can get dressed up and go to the Oscars. Queers protest outside the\u00a0Oscars. Queers stick together. I don\u2019t own a pair of nice slacks. I don\u2019t own a jacket or a suit (or a top hat). I have nothing appropriate to wear to a wedding or a funeral. I stopped going anywhere that I can\u2019t go in jeans. I\u2019m self-limiting. There is no eloquent way to phrase the next thought, so I will phrase it awkwardly: I don\u2019t know why I keep my female secondary sex characteristics when I don\u2019t want to be seen as female. Are they what queers me? Would I still be queer if I took testosterone? This is the odd and awkward place I am in. It is a queer place, a butch place, a gender non-conforming place, an eccentric place, and an idiosyncratic place. I don\u2019t know if it is the place I want to end up at. Everything I\u2019ve done so far in my transition has made me feel a little queerer, a little more masculine, and a lot more like myself. I don\u2019t know if I want to shift from being visibly queer to being a visible man. Notes: One of the first books I read when I started to read transgender books was Jamison Green\u2019s \u201cBecoming a Visible Man\u201c. It is also the book that convinced me that I probably didn\u2019t want to follow the \u201cstandard\u201d social and medical transition path. I had to keep reading to find a viable path. This five minute video, What Does It Mean To Be Queer?, came out just in time for this post. Shon doesn\u2019t actually answer the question, but I like the other questions that Shon throws into the mix. ", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
