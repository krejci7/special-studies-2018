Every time I get called Ma\u2019am, it\u2019s like getting slapped in the face with a dead fish. For years I\u2019ve tried to adjust to strangers calling me Ma\u2019am. I\u2019ve tried to ignore it. To acknowledge it and let it roll off of me. To accept that in a cisnormative society I\u2019m perceived as a masculine female or as a butch lesbian. To accept that some people must use only Sir, Miss, or Ma\u2019am in their jobs. To accept that other people can\u2019t imagine any other alternatives, even when one is standing right in front of them. I\u2019ve tried to listen to the tone of the Ma\u2019am. To guess the intention. Is it friendly? Is it innocent? Is it automatic? Is it sardonic? Is it because they don\u2019t know what else to call me? I wish it didn\u2019t bother me. There are far worse things going on in the world than the cashier at Whole Foods calling me Ma\u2019am. Or the bank teller. Or the staff at the front desk of the gym. Yet each Ma\u2019am smacks me in the face. I don\u2019t know if calling me Ma\u2019am counts as a microaggression, but it feels like one to me. Columbia Professor\u00a0Derald Wing Sue defines microaggressions as \u201cbrief, everyday exchanges that send denigrating messages to certain individuals because of their group membership.\u201d Microaggressions\u00a0are \u201cdifferent from deliberate acts of bigotry because the people perpetrating microaggressions often intend no offense and are unaware they are causing harm.\u201d Microaggressions \u201cinclude statements that position the dominant culture as normal and the minority one as aberrant or pathological, that express disapproval of or discomfort with the minority group, that assume all minority group members are the same.\u201d Microaggressors are\u00a0ignorant, with a little arrogance and privilege thrown into the mix. They think they know how I identify by looking at me, and that everyone who looks like me identifies the same way. They believe it is my problem that I don\u2019t neatly fit into one of two boxes, and that they have the right to assign me to the one that makes them most comfortable. They don\u2019t see the need to educate themselves, because they don\u2019t see their own prejudices. I don\u2019t know if can respond to being called Ma\u2019am honestly and without hostility. Without humiliating or putting the other person on the defensive. I don\u2019t know if it is better to let it go or to say something. New Yorkers view all non-essential interactions\u00a0as a delay. WIll someone on the back of the line sigh loudly, or make a snarky comment, if I start to say something? When other kids picked on me, my parents told me to ignore them. To develop a thick skin. To not fight back. To take the high road. I tried to not let the name calling and teasing bother me, but it was impossible to ignore. When I was in college, when I wore my MIT sweatshirt off campus, random people would ask me \u201cDoes your boyfriend go to MIT?\u201d The\u00a0question surprised me. Boyfriend? Me? I started answering with \u201cI go to MIT and my girlfriend goes to Lehigh.\u201d Some people took offense. Halfway through my first semester I stopped wearing the sweatshirt. I don\u2019t want to feel diminished, obliterated, or angry, but I haven\u2019t found a way to turn being called Ma\u2019am into a neutral experience or to stop it from happening. I haven\u2019t discovered the magic way to\u00a0protect myself from the damage, or to regenerate the damaged parts. The best I can do right now is to acknowledge it, feel the pain, take a deep breath, remind myself of who I am, and go on with my life. Notes: Most media discussions of microaggressions, like Simba Runyowa\u2019s piece in\u00a0The Atlantic, focus on race and college campuses. Debito Arudou\u2019s article, \u201cYes, I can use chopsticks..\u201d, from the Japan Times,\u00a0discusses the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s of challenging \u201cfriendly\u201d microaggressions. The graphic I used for the post is one frame from a comic by Transitive Properties aptly titled \u201cThe Fish Metaphor\u201d. You can see the whole comic here \u2013 it accurately captures my experience. ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
