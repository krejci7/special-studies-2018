Now that I\u2019ve had top surgery, I\u2019d like to stop thinking about what to do next and settle back into my butch/transgender self. Without feeling pressured to be on some trajectory with an endpoint. WIthout being swept away by someone else\u2019s idea of the transgender narrative. The pressure to keep going is subtle. The unspoken assumption is that next year I\u2019ll be taking T and using the men\u2019s room. That transition has a starting line and a finish line and once the starting gun goes off all the participants are full speed ahead on the shortest path. There is no place in that race for\u00a0a meandering half-baked genderqueer person. An acquaintance ran into me on the street and we chatted. Later, she asked Donna how long I\u2019ve taken testosterone for (I don\u2019t) and if I\u2019ve always had a mustache. Yes. I\u2019ve always had what I refer to as my \u201cFu\u201d but no one said anything about it until I changed my name. My Fu is most prominent on my upper right lip. I neither want my Fu to spread and grow nor do I want it to disappear. I\u2019m fond of it. I never shaved, plucked, or bleached it (chin hairs are another story).\u00a0 I\u2019d like to regain my patience with whatever it is that I am doing. I lost it in the build up to top surgery, when I was overcome by that feeling of MUST DO THIS NOW. Now there is no rush to do anything else and the quietness makes me uncomfortable. Should I be doing something else? Is it really OK to stop here? I completely understand guys who are in a rush to transition and who want the changes to come as fast as humanly possible (voice drop, muscle mass, jaw square, facial hair). They want to look definitively masculine and be consistently\u00a0read as male. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m satisfied with how with how I\u2019m read by other people. I feel misgendered regardless of whether I\u2019m called Sir or Ma\u2019am. My appearance confuses people. RIght now I feel as trans as I want to be, and as butch as I want to be. I want to keep tinkering\u00a0until I\u00a0get the right balance of internal and external gender expression. Sometimes I feel an internal pressure to transition, mostly due to self-doubt and the fear that if I don\u2019t transition I will never fit in. I can imagine comfort in following a path, a set of directives, with an endpoint of M. I have the awkward deportment of a tween; not comfortable playing with the children or conversing with the adults. It is\u00a0a lonely place. Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion says that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. As soon as I start thinking about organized standardized medical transition my rebellious self asks \u201cWho made the rules and why should I follow them?\u201d And ultimately I don\u2019t. Every morning I brush my teeth and look up in the mirror. Lately I\u2019ve noticed my Fu, and wondered why it is there. For every trans person like me who likes their mustache or is waiting for one to grow in, there is an equal and opposite trans person wishing their five o\u2019clock shadow would disappear. And we are all looking in our mirrors trying to make the best of it. Marcel Duchamp as Rrose Selavy. Notes: Marcel Duchamp was an artist associated with Cubism, Surrealism, and Dadaism, although he avoided being labeled as such. His art is gender-bending, playful, and punning. The photo is\u00a0by Man Ray, and is of Marcel Duchamp in the created role of Rrose Selavy \u2013 which, like any good drag name, has multiple meanings. In French it transliterates into \u201cEros, c\u2019est la vie\u201d i.e. \u201cEros, such is life.\u201d ", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
