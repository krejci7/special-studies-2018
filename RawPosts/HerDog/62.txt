Except that I can\u2019t really say that. I can\u2019t easily explain, to someone who barely knows me, that I did lose weight, but they are probably noticing that I had top surgery (in December 2014) and then I went out and bought clothes that fit me. I lost some weight, but mostly I lost my shame. Not all of it, but a healthy chunk. My dentist was the most recent person to ask me \u201cYou look great, did you lose weight?\u201d He is a middle-aged straight white guy. He looks like he is in good shape. I imagine he has an easy life, but all I know about him is that he lives in the suburbs and took over the dental practice when his father retired. We mostly discuss my teeth. He is big on flossing. He told me to \u201ckeep on doing whatever it is you are doing\u201d and I was tempted to explain just what it is that I\u2019m doing. He was picking up on something, but it eluded him. My transition is only visible if you know what you are looking for. The gracious thing to say is \u201cThank you, I feel great.\u201d and move on, but I hate when people bring up my weight. His statement implied that I used to look overweight, uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfashionable (true on all counts). He might have meant to pay me a compliment, but instead he fat shamed me. I don\u2019t want it to be\u00a0all about the weight. For fifty years I put up with all kinds of fat shaming. Most of it from my mother. All of it unsolicited. From the \u201cYou\u2019d be so pretty if you lost weight\u201d to \u201cI\u2019m only concerned about your health\u201d to \u201cYou\u2019ll never lose weight if you eat so much bread.\u201d Shame is not a good motivator.\u00a0I didn\u2019t do anything about my weight for years. I didn\u2019t want to diet and I didn\u2019t want to be pretty. I just wanted the problem to go away and for everyone else to shut up about it already. If I look \u201cgreat\u201d, it is because I lost the weight of all that shame. It took me a long time to realize that weight wasn\u2019t my problem, it was my solution to not wanting to be\u00a0a girl. It was there for a reason. For me, shame and overeating go together. I\u2019ve come across many \u201ctips for trans men\u201d \u2013 mostly young guys giving advice to other young guys. The top three tips are to\u00a0lose weight and lower your body fat percentage (eliminate curves), work out (to build up your back, chest, and shoulder muscles), and wear mens/boys clothes that fit (don\u2019t wear baggy clothes). These tips did not work for me until I accepted the limitations of my body, got top surgery, and exorcised my shame. Slowly, my envy of other trans bodies has faded. I\u2019m solid instead of lanky. I\u2019m not willing to put in the effort to get lean and buff. I have the body of a short middle-aged transgender butch who goes to the gym intermittently and is not (yet?) on testosterone. I could do better, but I no longer feel compelled to compare my body to everyone else\u2019s. Trans or cis. The pictures that I chose for this post illustrate dangerous (tobacco) and harmless (belly trimming) weight loss regimens from the 1930\u2019s. I am curious whether fifty years from now everything I am doing will look as ridiculous. Notes: This is a good article on fat shaming and fatphobia, from xojane. Although it is not specific to the LGBT\u00a0community, it is relevant to anyone who has dysphoria. This article, \u201c19 Men Go Shirtless And Share Their Body Image Struggles\u201d should be titled \u201c19 Cisgender Men\u2026\u201d but is otherwise very interesting. Lastly, I found a sweet site on Tumblr called chubbytubbytrans, which needs no further description. ", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
