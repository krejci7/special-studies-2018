Serious sniffing. This forces me to make small talk with the other owner. At first, being a shy person, this seemed like a weird thing to do. Now it is natural. The standard questions are boy or girl (if it is not obvious), what is\u00a0your dog\u2019s name, and what kind of dog is that. I\u2019ve learned to recognize a lot of unusual breeds and\u00a0\u201cdesigner\u201d mixes. Some\u00a0owners know what\u00a0mix their mutt is because they adopted the dog as a puppy\u00a0and know the dam (and sire). Some owners guess based on what the dog looks like (ears, muzzle, tail, markings). Most of us are curious. To solve the mystery, I could do a DNA test and find out Gracie\u2019s genetic material. I\u2019d have to swab her dog\u2019s mouth, put the results in a plastic container, and send it to the lab. A few weeks later they would tell me how many different breeds were identified, and the percentage of each breed in the mix. When asked, I say that Gracie was supposed to be a Flat-Coated Retriever mix, but she seems more like a Border\u00a0Collie mix. I haven\u2019t done the test. What if it came back that she was a Chow/Chihuahua mix, or a Spitz/Field Spaniel mix? Would I feel differently about her if I knew her true genetic identity?\u00a0What would Gracie\u2019s results tell me? We\u2019ve already figured out each other\u2019s personality, routines, and obnoxious habits.  I can\u2019t ask Gracie if she feels more like a Border Collie or more like a Flat-Coated Retriever. If she could answer, she\u2019d probably say that she doesn\u2019t know what a Border Collie feels like or how it is different from what a Flat-Coated Retriever feels like. \u00a0Sometimes she feels like chasing sheep (futile\u00a0because we live in Manhattan)\u00a0and sometimes she feels like chewing on a sawed off deer antler (possible\u00a0as one is always in her toy box unless she already pulled it out). She would add that she never, ever, feels like playing fetch with a tennis ball. Then she might roll over for a belly rub, unsure of the difference between feelings and instinct. I don\u2019t know what my DNA test would show. Scientists haven\u2019t found the butch gene or the transgender gene. I\u2019ve always felt hardwired to be\u00a0more boy than girl. It is an intrinsic, subconscious, pull. There is a wide range of gender expression for women to choose from, but none of it feels right to me. When I look at women on the subway I can see a lot of subtle differences in how they present themselves. Sexy, demure, conservative, punk, religious, intellectual, athletic, hipster, girly, colorful, expensive, maternal, trendy. I\u2019ve never seen a woman on the subway and thought \u201cI\u2019d like to look like that\u201d or even \u201cI\u2019d like to wear that\u201d. When I\u2019ve had to wear women\u2019s clothes I\u2019ve felt like an impostor.\u00a0I am comfortable with the\u00a0jeans, t-shirt, plaid shirt, sweater, and hiking\u00a0boot look. There are a lot of guys on the subway who\u00a0wear a variation of that look. Some go for lumberjack, others for geeky/nerd. I go for \u201ca boy and her dog\u201d. It\u2019s in my DNA. I\u2019ve got the dog gene.  ", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
