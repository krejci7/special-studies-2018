I didn\u2019t plan it that way. My\u00a0sixth grade class at P.S. 40\u00a0performed the musical South Pacific. I can still sing some of the songs. It is a Rodgers and Hammerstein classic.\u00a0\u00a0Some Enchanted Evening, I\u2019m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair, You\u2019ve Got to Be Taught, and There Is Nothin\u2019 Like a Dame. The play was\u00a0considered\u00a0progressive by New York City public school standards.\u00a0It touched on\u00a0war, race, and privilege without referencing Vietnam, the civil rights movement, or white flight. Subjects we did not discuss much at home or in school. Our class\u00a0probably performed a sanitized\u00a0and\u00a0abridged version of it. When I listened to\u00a0the original 1949 cast album some of the songs were unfamiliar. My\u00a0memories of the\u00a0play are sketchy. It was set\u00a0on a\u00a0island,\u00a0there was a love story, one of the male characters had a scene where he wore a grass skirt and a coconut cup bikini top, and\u00a0the play\u00a0had a bittersweet ending.\u00a0All I remember clearly\u00a0is that I was a Seabee in the chorus. Original 1949 cast, the Thanksgiving Follies scene. I wanted to look like a real sailor, not like Mary Martin. Everyone in the class had to be\u00a0cast in the play. Most of us ended up in the chorus, either\u00a0as a\u00a0nurse or as a sailor. Because I was a girl I was originally cast as a nurse,\u00a0but I objected and requested to serve as a Seabee. I had short hair and already had the costume (blue\u00a0jeans, a white T-shirt, and white canvas sneakers). It never hurts to ask for what you want, but you need to be\u00a0prepared\u00a0for the consequences.\u00a0My request was granted. I was issued\u00a0my Seabee hat, a classic \u201cDixie Cup\u201c, and went off to practice with the boys. There were a lot of rehearsals for only one performance. I told my parents that I was in the chorus. The Dixie Cup hat was the prize. I always wanted to dress up as a sailor, and even though I was eleven, and a little old for it, I was game. I knew I was on the cusp of \u201cwomanhood\u201d, but I still desperately wanted to be a boy. I practiced getting the tilt of the hat just right, like a real sailor. The afternoon of the performance I changed into my costume and adjusted my hat.\u00a0I\u00a0was\u00a0the\u00a0chubby kid in a Seabee\u00a0outfit proudly and enthusiastically belting out \u201cThere ain\u2019t a thing wrong with any man here, that can\u2019t be cured by putting him near, a girly, womanly, female, feminine dame.\u201d My mother had a meltdown at the party after\u00a0the performance. \u201cWhy\u00a0did they cast\u00a0you as a sailor? Why\u00a0were you\u00a0the only child who didn\u2019t have a solo line? What is wrong with you? Why didn\u2019t\u00a0you say something? How could\u00a0you embarrass\u00a0me this way?\u201d We left before I got a piece of cake. It was true that I didn\u2019t get\u00a0to sing a\u00a0solo, and it was true that I didn\u2019t have any spoken lines. I wasn\u2019t keeping track of who sang or spoke. All the class misfits were in the chorus.\u00a0I\u00a0was\u00a0happy to be\u00a0a Seabee\u00a0and to be singing the truth. ", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
