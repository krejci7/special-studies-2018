I pre-pack my gym bag with shorts, socks, a T-shirt, sneakers, and a charged iPod. When I\u2019m in a gym frame of mind I feel strong and solid. I don\u2019t hesitate or find excuses to avoid going. I didn\u2019t go back to the gym after I came back from New Mexico. It took me six weeks to get around to it, and when I went back, it didn\u2019t feel right. Not the first time, not the second time. The third time I realized that I didn\u2019t want to go into the locker room to change or shower. I forced myself to do it. I wasn\u2019t avoiding working out, I was avoiding changing in public. I was avoiding being naked in a women\u2019s space. For 15 years I have steeled myself to walk in and out of the women\u2019s locker room. I tried to convince myself that not only do I have a right to be there, but that I should keep going until it stops bothering me. That I should exercise my right to use it. I am more aware of being transmasculine in female gendered spaces since I had top surgery. I want the gym to be a place where I don\u2019t think about my gender. While I am comfortable on the gym floor lifting weights, I don\u2019t want to keep pretending that I am comfortable entering that locker room. I\u2019d rather change and shower at home, even though it is less convenient. The first open dressing room I encountered was at Loehmann\u2019s in Riverdale (The Bronx). My grandmother and mother shopped there for deeply discounted designer dresses, and brought me along. There were racks and racks of dresses. Loehmann\u2019s had a large communal dressing room with no partitions and no privacy. The walls were lined with mirrors and a few pegs to hang up clothes. I\u2019d seen my mother and grandmother struggle to get into girdles, and wrangle the hooks on their bra\u2019s, but I\u2019d never seen a room full of women in foundation garments wriggling in and out of cocktail dresses. I was mortified. Embarrassed. I wanted to go home. There was no place to look without catching a glimpse of a woman getting undressed. I received an unwanted education in the variety of bra\u2019s, girdles, panties, and hosiery available to women of all sizes and ages. The women chattered away as they tried on dress after dress. Unsolicited opinions were offered on size, cut, color, original price, and the appropriateness of the outfit. There was a possibility of finding something fabulous, but no one wanted to make a mistake; everything at Loehmann\u2019s was final sale. I was vaguely aware that I was supposed to enjoy this. I avoid the locker room during peak hours. The undergarments that women wear have changed, but my feelings about them haven\u2019t. I feel odd pulling my T-shirt on after I come out of the shower. My boxer briefs are clearly not panties. Even my athletic socks look out-of-place. I don\u2019t know where to rest my eyes. My discomfort is the same discomfort I had as a child, except that this time around I\u2019m in charge. Last year I wrote \u201cTopless in the Locker Room\u201d to convince myself to tough it out. Today, I\u2019m throwing in the towel and showering at home. Notes: This post \u201cEven Lumberjacks Deserve Lotion: Gender in the Locker Room\u201d is a great description of what it feels like to be gender non-conforming at the gym. The author is a member of the same gym chain that I go to (NYSC). Loehmann\u2019s went out of business in 2014. It is memorialized in Mara Menachem\u2019s post \u201cEverything I Learned, I Learned in the Group Dressing Room at Loehmann\u2019s\u201c. \u00a0 ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
