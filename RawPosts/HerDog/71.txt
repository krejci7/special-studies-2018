However, a blogging friend, Mrs. Fever, invited me to write a guest post on her blog Temperature\u2019s Rising, and I invite you to read the post (link is below) and also to hop around her blog. Before you link, some of Mrs. Fever\u2019s writing is NSFW! It is however, excellent and often hot. So be forewarned. My post is pure vanilla, \u00a0and discusses various aspects of my coming out stories. Plural. The link is here. Happy reading, happy July. See you in a few weeks.
