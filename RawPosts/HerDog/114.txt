I\u2019m trying to balance my butch identity with my transgender identity; to walk the trans-masculine tightrope. It is about being honest in my relationship, talking in therapy, being open at work, and showering at the gym. It is about the long haul. Philippe Petit crossing between the unfinished towers of the World Trade Center, 1974 It isn\u2019t about labels. It is about asking for, and accepting, support for\u00a0who I am. I am not good at the getting help thing. Sometimes I feel like I am lost, without GPS, and afraid to ask for directions. I don\u2019t know if I am just around the corner from my destination, or if it is still miles away. What does it take to live\u00a0as a non-binary (genderqueer, agender, or neutrois) person? I\u2019ve been visibly queer since childhood, but it wasn\u2019t always intentional. I couldn\u2019t stomach the alternatives. What does it take to do it deliberately and consciously? Please don\u2019t answer patience and perseverance. Being in the middle feels more right than the alternatives. I don\u2019t think it is a rest stop on the journey to trans man, but stopping short is socially awkward. A body in motion stays in motion. No one outside the community has asked me what my preferred pronouns are or used them in my presence.\u00a0I fill out forms that require me to check off M or F. When I self-correct the form, I am given the lame excuse that the computer will only accept one or the other. There is no box for butch, trans-masculine, or queer. Just F or M, when I need FML (see my notes if you are not familiar with the acronym). I am still looking for the PATH. I had to choose whether to go through life defaulting to F or transitioning to M. I\u2019m in default F mode, confusing people without apology. I don\u2019t think I need to change my gender marker or take testosterone, but I can not make compromises that throw\u00a0me into the vortex of body\u00a0dysphoria. There are some things I can compromise on. I can tolerate being seen as female as long as I can express that I am trans-masculine. I can tolerate dealing with a women\u2019s locker room freak out when I forget that I am wearing boxer briefs and a binder. I can tolerate female pronouns even though I prefer the third person singular. I can live with the institutional default to F, even if I would check a different box if it existed. I found out that I can\u2019t compromise on my name or top surgery (although I did agree to delay surgery until December). I can\u2019t compromise on what I wear\u00a0(jeans, button downs, flannel shirts, and T-shirts). I can\u2019t pretend that I am just butch; I can\u2019t pretend that I am not transgender. My plan for the fall is to line up support for top surgery, for staying in the middle, and for being open about it. I want to be in it for the long haul. Notes: Philippe Petit walked that wire without safety nets and without permission. A summary of his story is here.\u00a0While I was at NYCT, my co-workers had a chuckle as senior management tried to place the blame on low-level staff for the unintentional sign f-up. Here is CNET\u2019s report, and for a history of FML there is this post at Cracked. ", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
