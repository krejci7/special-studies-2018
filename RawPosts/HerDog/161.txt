We were a few weeks early, but something was going on\u00a0with her gastrointestinal system. Gracie hates the Vet. To get her there I have to go on a roundabout walk that just happens to end at their door. Halfway down the block she realizes where we\u00a0are,\u00a0stiffens up, digs into the concrete,\u00a0and refuses to budge. Her eyes narrow into little slits. I\u2019ve\u00a0betrayed her again. In the waiting room I sweet talk her and give her a biscuit. I scratch her ears and tell her she is a good girl. She is anxious. She whines. I\u2019m embarrassed that my dog is a bad patient. Each visit she is a bit more obstinate. Each visit she has to wear \u201ca party hat\u201d so the Vet can draw blood, take her temperature, and give her shots.\u00a0 She doesn\u2019t like it, and it is a tussle to get the muzzle on properly. She is fear aggressive, and it takes two of us to get it on safely. Gracie would not pose in a \u201cparty hat\u201d for me. This is a better behaved dog. Gracie is six, middle aged\u00a0but juvenile.\u00a0 Something she has in common with me. The stool and blood tests come back; she has a little giardia, nothing to worry about, it has been going\u00a0around. They give me\u00a0five packets of a powder. I mix one a day into her dinner. I pick up some heartworm\u00a0nuggets and Frontline. I pay the bill. Hopefully, we won\u2019t be back until next year. I stare at the telephone unable to make the phone call, unable to cross off\u00a0\u201cmake appointment with gynecologist\u201d from my list.\u00a0 I hate going even though I am sure\u00a0the doctor\u00a0is a lovely person. I am way overdue, but I feel fine. For years I didn\u2019t go to a doctor.\u00a0I wasn\u2019t on birth control, I didn\u2019t want children, I never got sick. I only started going during peri-menopause when I began hemorrhaging\u00a0from fibroids. I had huge fibroids. Depending upon the\u00a0surgeon\u2019s preference for sports or food metaphors I had either softballs or grapefruits. I was determined\u00a0to go through a natural menopause, and thought I could tough it out. I couldn\u2019t. After two surgeries to remove\u00a0reoccurring\u00a0fibroids\u00a0I acquiesced and had a partial hysterectomy (uterus out, cervix and ovaries remain). Looking back, I don\u2019t know why I resisted having my uterus removed. I had read up and done my research. The hormones are in the ovaries and find their way into your bloodstream without the uterus, so there was no need to go on hormone therapy.\u00a0 If you\u00a0keep\u00a0your cervix\u00a0there\u00a0is\u00a0minimal loss of sexual responsiveness.\u00a0My system had to go through a little internal nerve rewiring\u00a0but within a few months I was fine and had orgasms that I couldn\u2019t complain about. I felt better almost immediately. I was, and still am,\u00a0ecstatic to not have my period. I never acknowledged how much I detested getting it. How uncomfortable it made me feel. My body betraying my mind. My denial ran to not keeping track of it; every month it seemed like a surprise. Cramps and crankiness. I always seemed to be out of tampons and Advil Extra Strength. Each visit\u00a0to the gynecologist freaks me out and kicks up all sorts of traumatic dust.\u00a0I don\u2019t like having anyone\u00a0else\u00a0touch me there or poke around. I tell myself that I can not wait until something is wrong; I have to go in for a visit. I try to psych myself up to make the call. I have to be a grown up. I remind myself that if you are an adult with some combination of a vagina, ovaries, a cervix,\u00a0and a uterus you need to go in\u00a0for a check-up. For preventive maintenance. Doesn\u2019t matter if you identify\u00a0as gay, straight, butch, femme, transgender, female or male. But I wish someone else would make the appointment, snap the lead on my collar, walk me there, put on the muzzle, and pay the bill. ", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
