The dog days of summer. It is hot in New York. Unless you stay in\u00a0 your apartment with the air conditioning on you can not escape the heat. The sidewalks are hot, the subway platform is hot, the dog run is hot. I try to take Gracie in the evening once it cools down a little. Last week she wasn\u2019t interested in going out for walks. She skipped a meal. When it is hot\u00a0Gracie finds a cool place on the wood floor and lies down. She laps\u00a0up\u00a0some water and chews on an antler. I get lazy too. I skipped the gym; I went to the dog run and had a couple of beers. The dogs splashed around in the wading pool and then lay down on the hot pavement\u00a0and watched us drink. I put on a couple of pounds and blamed it on Gracie. The summer\u00a0is prime time for losing weight, but I am exactly where I was in April. I am still on Weight Watchers. I am still a few pounds short of my goal. Depending upon\u00a0whether I\u00a0view the\u00a0pint glass as half\u00a0full or half empty,\u00a0this is\u00a0either\u00a0a success or a failure. Or\u00a0it is\u00a0an experiment to see what it takes to\u00a0maintain\u00a0my weight rather than have it creep back up. I\u2019ve learned that I can\u2019t suck down beers and skip going to the gym. I\u2019ve got to cut down on the beer and work out if I want to see shoulder and back muscles. The dog days are mindless and static. They are not a time of deep thinking and reflection. I save that for September. This year Rosh\u00a0Hashanah\u00a0(Jewish New Year) starts at sundown on September 4; the earliest day that it can fall in the Gregorian calendar. I look forward to the\u00a0ten days\u00a0of reflection and repentance between Rosh\u00a0Hashanah\u00a0and Yom\u00a0Kippur. It is a time to\u00a0think about the past\u00a0year,\u00a0my successes and my failures. About what changes I need to make in the new year. I am Jewish, but I am not religious. It is ingrained\u00a0in\u00a0my thought process, my speech, my outlook, and my kitchen. I was raised\u00a0to\u00a0read, study, analyze, deliberate, reflect, interpret, and eat. It affects how I think about my body. How I think about being butch, being queer, and being trans*. I grew up in family that believed deeply in the American\u00a0dream (or at least a German-Jewish middle class version of it). It was important to speak proper English (no Yiddish), to not talk with your hands,\u00a0 and to not\u00a0look\u00a0too Jewish.\u00a0There were long discussions\u00a0about whether it was acceptable to get a \u201cnose job\u201d or to anglicize your last name. The line between assimilating (hiding your Jewishness)\u00a0and integrating into the mainstream as a Jew. My family did not want to be marginalized with the greenhorns and the orthodox. They cared about what other people thought about them. For me, there are parallels between top surgery and nose jobs. I think about both in terms of dysphoria, cultural norms of beauty and handsomeness, body self-image, and reliance on the medical establishment. I am still thinking about top surgery. I do not want to assimilate, either by becoming a \u201cgood gay\u201d and looking less butch, or by transitioning and going stealth. On a good day, I am happily gender non-conforming and all for integration. On a bad day, I feel weird and marginalized. Today, I am a boy with her dog, heading out to the dog run for a beer and some shade. Tomorrow is gym day. ", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
