Getty Images. Another visit to the gym and another epiphany. In my previous\u00a0post I wrote that I feel physically safe in the women\u2019s locker room, but not emotionally safe. I try to ignore my emotions. It is machismo. I use the women\u2019s locker room because I think I should be strong enough to handle it. I think I should have a thick skin and not be bothered by how out-of-place I feel. That changing at home is wimping out. Because I don\u2019t want to let the girls with the pony tails chase me out of the playground again. It is grade school, redux. I also realized that I want to change and towel off like a guy, not a gal. I want to wrap the towel around my waist, not around my chest like a strapless little white cocktail dress. I don\u2019t want to look like a woman, even in the women\u2019s locker room. Even though I\u2019ve never used a men\u2019s locker room, I know that guys don\u2019t wrap like that. Not me. Not Gracie. But I\u2019d wear the green towel that way. Getty Images. If I brought a beach towel I could put it over my shoulders and cover everything in a more neutral way (thank you to Mary for sharing your coping mechanisms). I\u2019ve only seen a few women completely naked at the gym. It is a breach of etiquette to stroll around the locker room naked. It is a breach of etiquette to look at someone while they are changing, especially if you can see anything. Especially if you are a butch lesbian or a masculine genderqueer person with a vagina. Better to be stared at than to be caught staring. I count on the gym to ring my male chimes, and the locker room gets in the way of that. I work out in a heather gray T-shirt and navy blue\u00a0shorts. No spandex, no capris, no neon, no big logos. I like having muscles, and even though I am not on testosterone, I have pretty decent back and shoulder muscles (for a girl). I am solid for my size. If it would do any good, I\u2019d hang upside down from the gym bars to gain a couple of inches or a shoe size. I\u2019m stuck at 5\u20194\u2033\u00a0with a size\u00a07 US men\u2019s shoe. Unfortunately, neither the gym nor testosterone can help me there. When I first started using free weights, the trainer told me \u201cdon\u2019t round your back, straighten it out.\u201d I was bent over at a 90\u00b0 angle, and even though I was looking in the mirror, I could not figure out how to shift from a rounded back to a flat back. I could not isolate\u00a0any of the muscles. I could not manipulate my body. Now I automatically check my alignment from my head to my toes. Everything feels connected. My first time back in the gym after top surgery I took it really easy. I dropped the weight down and worked out with dumbbells and kettlebells for flexibility and form. My second time back\u00a0I dropped the weight but did my regular work out. It felt right except for the bench press. I couldn\u2019t \u201cfind\u201d my chest muscles. I could move the bar up and down (20 lbs. less than usual), but I couldn\u2019t feel my chest muscles contract. I was all arms and shoulders. I didn\u2019t have the guts to wriggle around and flex my pecs in the gym mirror. I waited until I got home. I took off my shirt and stood in front of the mirror and took some deep breaths. I tried to flex. Nothing moved except my shoulders. I clasped my hands in front of my chest, breathed in, tensed, and squeezed, and they moved. My pectoral muscles look lopsided (from top surgery), but they are there. I flexed a dozen times and then it clicked. They contracted on demand. I\u2019ll be able to build them back up in time for the summer, even if I\u2019m swimming with the shirts instead of the skins. Notes: Here is a good explanation of why testosterone doesn\u2019t make you taller, from a FtM site in Australia, and here is a twenty-minute movie about a stealth trans man caught up in a shirts vs. skins basketball game.
