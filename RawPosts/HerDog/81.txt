Photo by Charles Trainor. It has been almost two years since I went swimming. It is a shame. I love the beach and I love swimming in the ocean. I stopped going to the beach because wearing a women\u2019s swimsuit hit the perfect trifecta of dysphoria, negative body image, and self-consciousness. My Speedo made me look like I had breasts (or more accurately, I could not ignore my breasts when I wore it). My Speedo displayed my hairy armpits and a tract\u00a0of dark hair running from my crotch to my big toe. I wore a T-shirt and shorts over my swimsuit except when I was in the water. I was envious of the guys. Gangly teenagers in baggy knee-length board shorts. Collegiate life guards with ripped abs and a full body tan. Pale dads with\u00a0beer bellies rolling over the edge of their trunks. There was not a woman on the beach whom I wanted to look like. Not even the other butch lesbians. I don\u2019t want to look like a woman. I look a little less like one now than I did three years ago, but I\u2019m not sure what I actually look like. I\u2019m not sure what I want to look like; how much further I want to go, what I\u2019m willing to do to get there. Currently, I have (knock wood) very little body dysphoria. I attribute this to top surgery, losing weight, and making an effort to\u00a0wear clothing I feel comfortable in (refusing to wear anything that triggers my dysphoria). I have vestiges of negative body image. I am\u00a0self-conscious. I\u2019ve never worn a bikini top (even with board shorts) or shown my midriff in public. The tops were too girly, and I was too\u00a0chubby. Today, I like my chest but I\u2019m still critical of my middle-aged jelly belly.\u00a0I repeat to myself, over and over, that this year I\u2019m going swimming in board shorts and a rash guard. It is my mantra. I have dormant self-consciousness about not shaving. The last time I shaved was the last time I wore a skirt, and I forget how rare it is for women to have visible leg hair. When I feel self-conscious about it, I remind myself that shaving body hair is a cultural convention that I don\u2019t take part in. Being hairy feels right to me because I associate it with being masculine. I am actively self-conscious about how masculine I look, and how my gender expression makes me stick out. This is strictly about how others perceive me and potentially judge me as butch or transgender. I don\u2019t blend in. I don\u2019t identify with any of the media images of what women should\u00a0look like. Sometimes I am grateful that there are so few media images of great looking butch, genderqueer, and non-binary people. There is no one to compare myself against. There is no genderqueer at the beach look. As pasunhomme noted in last week\u2019s post, the beach is the most cisgender place in the USA. The\u00a0public beaches in Massachusetts don\u2019t have formal dress codes, but they prohibit nudity (and women can\u2019t go topless). There is an informal dress code; no cross-dressing at the beach. And my plan is to violate that rule, and swim. Notes: I love this picture of The Beatles at Miami Beach. When I was six I wanted to look just like Paul McCartney in A Hard Day\u2019s Night. Some things never change. I recently came across a short essay by Dean Spade:\u00a0Dress to Kill, Fight to Win.\u00a0 It encouraged me to find an alternative to that accursed Speedo.
