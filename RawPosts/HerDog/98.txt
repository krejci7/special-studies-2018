It\u2019s been three weeks since I had top-surgery. I look so natural to myself in the mirror that it is impossible to believe that I used to be a 38C. I\u2019m not exactly flat chested; my breast bone is prominent, and even as the bruising goes down, I look like I\u2019ve got pecs. Euphoria. I also have scars, scabs, stitches, and a little flaking and chafing. It isn\u2019t pretty.\u00a0I\u2019ve got three more weeks to go before I can walk around without compression. I\u2019m sleeping by myself (i.e. with Gracie) because I have to sleep on my back and I snore like Daffy Duck in this clip. Every morning I climb into the other bed, lie on my back, and cuddle with Donna. Donna still hasn\u2019t seen me shirtless, but she has seen me in shirts. She isn\u2019t ready to look at my scars. I don\u2019t blame her. Two years ago, Donna was shocked and upset that I started binding. In retrospect, it was the only trans action I took without prepping her beforehand or waiting for her to get used to the idea. To keep the peace, I agreed not to spring anything else on her and to include her in my decision-making. A year ago, Donna was talking about top surgery as self-mutilation and a form of misogyny. Yesterday, while were on the bus, she said that I look like myself only more so. She said my chest fits me. I had to ask her to repeat it. When we got home I took out some shirts I was ambivalent about. Shirts I would wear as an under layer, but not solo. Shirts that were close-fitting or thin enough that you could see the outline of my binder under the fabric. I tried them on. Imagine my surprise to see that they looked much, much, better on me post surgery. It wasn\u2019t the shirt that was the problem (they don\u2019t \u201clook\u201d like women\u2019s shirts) it was my breasts. My silhouette. Even in a binder.  I also tried on my remaining women\u2019s\u00a0flannel and chamois shirts (no darts-no princess seams). They are a little baggy, but they lay flat and don\u2019t \u201cblouse out\u201d \u2013 \u00a0I lost track of which ones buttoned right or left until I put them on. They\u2019ve been defanged. They are suitably butch and transmasculine. My chest fits me. After years of wearing loose shirts and layering to minimize my chest it is a relief to throw on a shirt and have it lay flat. Which brings me back to one of my original problems: I am 5\u20194\u2033. American clothing manufacturers are convinced that I am a size 10 petite, and they do not make men\u2019s or boy\u2019s off-the-rack shirts that fit me properly, with breasts or with a chest. I don\u2019t mind splurging on custom shirts. However, every T-shirt I\u2019ve tried on recently seems to be cut for a guy who is 6\u20192\u2033. Consequently, I\u00a0will start another cycle of researching which brands run short in T-shirts and \u00a0which brands run wide at the hips instead of tapered. My goal is to find one that looks right on me, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll find it in the women\u2019s sportswear department. Notes: While I was Googling \u201cclothes for short guys\u201d I found The Modest Man. The blog is run\u00a0by a 5\u20196\u2033 cis guy named Brock, and he has some interesting links and advice on dressing sharp while short. The photograph is of Harry Houdini (5\u20196\u2033), bound in chains, ready to make his escape. I know just how he feels. \u00a0 ", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
