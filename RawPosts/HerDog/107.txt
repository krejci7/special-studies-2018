Most cisgender people have no problem disclosing their pronouns, and resort to the pronouns they were\u00a0assigned\u00a0when they were born. Their gender expression is the same as their sex, and both are congruent with their pronouns. It is tidier when everything matches and nothing changes. There is nothing to explain. I feel trapped when asked to share my PGPs.\u00a0I can barely say they/them/their.\u00a0I know I secretly prefer he/him/his, but I won\u2019t say it. It would be a \u201cpronouncement\u201d that I\u2019m transitioning socially. I\u2019m not ready. I may never be ready.\u00a0 Being asked to state my pronouns makes me feel like I\u2019m \u201cnot trans enough.\u201d I hedge my answer. I explain that most of the people in my life, including Donna, use she/her/her, but I prefer they/them/their. I don\u2019t hear the question as \u201cWhat do you prefer I use when I refer to you?\u201d \u2013 I defensively hear the question as \u201cDo you use male pronouns and why not?\u201d In my mind he/him/his pronouns and testosterone go together like love and marriage. As the song states \u201cyou can\u2019t have one without the other\u201d even though I know several exceptions to this rule (butches on low dose testosterone who use female pronouns, and trans guys who have never gone on testosterone and use male pronouns). Name change and top surgery don\u2019t push you over the pronoun cliff unless you choose to jump. If I could think of the he/him/his pronouns as masculine, as opposed to male, I might be able to use them. If I could think of he/him/his as the pronoun equivalent of men\u2019s jeans (constructed for men but also worn by others for a variety of reasons) then they might fit me. I wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in women\u2019s jeans. But every day I live with she/her/her. They/them/their would be fine if I could screw up my courage and ask people to use them consistently.\u00a0Even asking friends to use they/them/their pronouns makes me feel like a demanding special snowflake. Gender expression is full of nuance; gender neutral pronouns are grammatically clunky. It is unrealistic, but I hope that somehow, someday, someone will start using they instead of she, and it will gather momentum and snowball. I don\u2019t want anyone to play along condescendingly. I want them to understand that, until everyone uses the same gender-neutral pronouns, my pronouns should have some relevance to who I am and how I present. She/her/her are wearing thin. I don\u2019t want to be referred to as \u201cher\u201d for the rest of my life. I struggle with residual feminist guilt over it. When I try to articulate why female pronouns annoy me, all I can say is that wearing anything feminine and being called by anything feminine bothers me. It always has and it always will. It is why I changed my name. It is why I dress the way I do. It is why I see myself as a boy, with my dog. The title of my blog is \u201cA Boy and Her Dog\u201d because it captures my conundrum. When I started the blog I hadn\u2019t started trying to use they/them/their. If I called it \u201cA Boy and Their Dog\u201d you wouldn\u2019t get the picture. If I called it \u201cA Boy and His Dog\u201d I\u2019d be probably be sued by the author\u00a0Harlan Ellison. Notes: While stumbling around looking for a history of gender neutral pronouns I discovered the term \u201cepicene pronouns\u201d and this article by Dennis Baron. I mistakenly assumed that the English language search for gender neutral pronouns started in the 1960\u2019s or 1970\u2019s. He traces it back to 1850.
