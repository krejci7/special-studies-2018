This concept is also used in The Gender Unicorn infographic,\u00a0which adds gender expression, and romantic/sexual attractions into the mix. The unicorn allows for infinite possibilities, including a continuum titled Other. \u00a0How do you measure otherness? My gender identity has been clear to me since I had the vocabulary for boy and girl, and the concept of self (I am). I am a boy. I also got the social construct of gender expression pretty quickly because I kept trying to do it my way instead of their way. I never understood biological sex, and it still perplexes me. The pre-puberty loop used to run something like this: I am a boy, I don\u2019t feel like a girl, I don\u2019t want to do girl stuff, I want to wear boy\u2019s clothes and look like a boy. It goes from straight from gender identity to gender expression, and avoids the issue of biological sex. I don\u2019t remember thinking that I wanted a boy\u2019s penis. I don\u2019t know if that is because I knew I didn\u2019t have it and couldn\u2019t get one, or because it seemed besides the point. Who needs that stuff to be a boy? Sex (biological or assigned at birth) is a confusing mess of gonadal hormones, the endocrine system, chromosomes, gametes, internal reproductive organs, and genitalia. It courses through my veins. Legal sex is stamped on all my documents. I did not understand why people kept telling me \u201cbecause you\u2019re a girl\u201d when it was clear to me that I wasn\u2019t really a girl. I knew that I was the only child who felt they were on the wrong line every morning in the school yard. Puberty complicated things. The rush of hormones created more visual cues and they were hard to camouflage. I didn\u2019t want hips, body fat, breasts, or body hair. All that estrogen did not change the loop. It was harder to look like a boy, but I gave it my best shot. In addition to not thinking about my body, I didn\u2019t think about the crushes I had on women, or about sex. I am both butch and transgender, and my gender expression is a mix of clothing, hair, shoes, comportment, speech, posture, tone, and affect. It is a mixed up version based on thousands of messages and cues I have rejected, intercepted, and partially digested for presenting as\u00a0white, middle-class, Jewish, female, male, queer, or a pacifist. It is intentional, unconscious, ridiculous, and authentic. Top surgery boosted my gender expression. I\u2019m not sure where testosterone fits into this, which is the reason I\u2019m still prevaricating. I don\u2019t want to change how I feel inside. I\u2019m not sure I want it pumping through my brain and rewiring my nervous system, the medical equivalent of Taz on a mission. I\u2019m not ready to poke and prod the primeval beast. Notes: I started thinking about gender identity versus gender expression when I was reading an article (which I can\u2019t find) on why it is OK to not match your gender identity with your gender expression (e.g. non-binary identity with masculine gender expression). While searching for that article, I found these two instead: Gender Expression Is Not Gender Identity\u00a0and Body Dysphoria and Gender-LEGOs. ", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
