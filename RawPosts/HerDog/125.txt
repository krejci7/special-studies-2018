Purgatory implies hope and patience. Donna is slowly reconciling herself to my having surgery. I\u2019m trying not to pressure her because I don\u2019t want to sabotage her efforts to come around to it on her own. I\u2019ve tried to take a break from thinking about top surgery, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve got the money, I\u2019ve got a doctor, but I don\u2019t want to proceed until Donna says she can handle it, or is willing to try. She mentioned the end of the year. I mentally put the Prosecco on ice. Meanwhile, nipples are on my mind. I am\u00a0obsessed with chests. I chest gazed while on vacation. Italian men take more care with their appearance than American men do. They wear their dress shirts, T-shirts, and polo shirts tighter. They show more. I\u2019m not attracted to men, but the Italian men are very attractive.\u00a0 I\u2019m used to having a flat chest from wearing a binder, but it is an undefined and schlumpy chest. I\u2019ve thought that I will look the same (dressed) after top surgery as I do wearing a binder, but that is not true. I will look similar. Less up top, a more noticeable midriff. I accept that I will never have David\u2019s\u00a0chest and abdomen. I will have a middle-aged jelly belly. My nipples could show through my T-shirts. I could end up with moobs. Some guys wear undershirts to keep their shirts clean and to absorb sweat. It also smooths out the chest. I\u2019ve tried to make\u00a0sure that my button-down shirts are loose, opaque, and thick enough not to show a bra or binder. Until now, I\u2019ve never given much thought to what I\u2019d wear under them if I got top surgery. \u00a0Or how I would feel going out in a T-shirt, with nothing on underneath. It is acceptable for men\u2019s nipples to bump out of a shirt, but it is a no-no for women\u2019s. Bra\u2019s cover and de-emphasize nipples. Sports bra and swimsuit descriptions are full of text reassuring the buyer that there is no show through. Even when it is cold. If you are \u201cperky\u201d there are products you can buy to cover your nipples. NipGuards are marketed for men; \u00a0they reduce chafing while running, but are also used for nipple camouflage for men who are self-conscious. Dr Weiss tries to keep the nipple attached (pedicle preservation) during double incision surgery, as an alternative to nipple grafts. His goal is a natural looking chest with full sensation. My goal is to be free of my breasts. Will I be self-conscious if my nipples are visible? I\u2019m butch, I\u2019m used to breaking fashion rules. I\u2019m not self conscious about having hairy legs and armpits. I justify not shaving by claiming that body hair is natural. Shaving is barbaric; a way to make women buy razors and depilatories. The truth is that I don\u2019t shave my body because it is something girls do. I won\u2019t have a pithy explanation for why I am getting top surgery. I am going to have to tell the truth. I don\u2019t like my breasts, they never felt like they belonged on me, and I hope I will feel more comfortable in my own body without them. Note: For anyone who wants detailed information on top surgery, \u00a0Neutrois Nonsense has several excellent detailed posts on choosing a surgeon, types of surgery, preparation and recovery. Gentleman\u2019s Gazette has a good history of undershirts, and some discussion of the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s of wearing one.  ", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
