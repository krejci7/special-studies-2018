The excuse is that I am going to the Butch Voices conference in Oakland.\u00a0The truth is that I miss feeling like I am part of a community; I need my tribe. I\u2019ve drifted out of my old communities (pacifist, AIDs activist, queer). I let friendships lapse, let Donna take control of our social life (not a criticism because otherwise we\u2019d have no social life at all), and I spend too much time with Gracie at the dog run. I am lonely and need some contact. I\u2019ve never found it easy to make friends; I trust people slowly. I need to be around\u00a0someone a lot before I open up.\u00a0I do\u00a0best in situations where I am immersed\u00a0with people for a long time. They get to observe me in action; I get to hang around them long enough to relax. I met Donna in the Women\u2019s Pentagon Action; we spent a lot of time together on the picket line. I need the company of others who are butch, masculine of center, transmasculine, and/or transgender. I am not concerned with what words they\u00a0use to self-identify. I want to find the other interlocking circles in my Venn Diagram. They don\u2019t have to occupy the same space; they don\u2019t need to be just like me. I don\u2019t know where butch ends and transgender begins. I used to picture\u00a0gender as two\u00a0overlapping bell curves, the first for\u00a0female and the second for male. I placed myself in the\u00a0valley of\u00a0the overlap (picture between the breasts). Then I realized that I didn\u2019t know which binary the curves represented. Gender stereotypes, cultural norms of femininity and masculinity, wardrobe style? When I was a kid I gendered everything. I divided the world into either boy\u2019s activity/behavior or girl\u2019s activity/behavior. I only wanted to read boy\u2019s books, play with boy\u2019s toys, wear boy\u2019s clothes. There was hardly anything that wasn\u2019t gendered by either style or color (stuffed animals, a guitar, roller skates). It didn\u2019t matter, I played with them as if I was a boy. I don\u2019t want to define myself based on a linear scale of femininity or masculinity. I don\u2019t want to place other people on\u00a0a gender line to the masculine of me or the feminine of me.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to place a value on anyone being less butch or more trans* than me. I don\u2019t want to judge if someone is butch enough or trans* enough. I don\u2019t want to be judged. I want to be seen and I want to be known. Last year I went for a day to the Philadelphia Trans-Health Conference. I attended some workshops and walked around the Convention Center. I had a shyness attack and a loss of confidence\u00a0and barely spoke to anyone else. I was envious of the young guys who had top surgery; of their ease in their bodies and their handsomeness. I also saw shy guys staring at their i-phones, middle-aged\u00a0butches trying to figure out if they should transition, and guys struggling through the awkward\u00a0stages of starting testosterone. I saw myself in them and them in me. I am not sure how I will react at Butch Voices. I am in a different place this\u00a0year; a little\u00a0less freaked out by my transness and a little more\u00a0accepting of my gender incorrigibility. I am packing my bag. For once, I am not worrying about what to wear. ", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
