I walked over to Molton Brown to get a new bottle. Molton Brown makes liquid soap, shampoo, and body wash products. They are all scented. Very British. I used to shop for personal care products in the health food store. I got turned on to Molton Brown in a bed and breakfast we stayed at in Bath, England, in 2002. Donna could not get me out of the shower because I was sudsing up with the comps. I got hooked. I like Brooklyn Brewery beer, but I don\u2019t want to wear it. I hadn\u2019t used strongly scented products before. My Dad smelled of Brylcreem, Dutch Masters cigars, and Miller High Life. I didn\u2019t want to smell like him. I wanted to smell good, but I didn\u2019t know how. It was a B&B that catered to gay men. This gave the products a masculine, or at least metrosexual, cachet. Good enough for a butch. I fell for the \u201cVitalizing Vitamin AB+C.\u201d It is a\u00a0citrusy\u00a0scent that makes me imagine that I am a large clean lemony fish swimming in the Mediterranean. I know this is an awkward metaphor; usually the lemon doesn\u2019t get on the fish until the fish is dead and on the grill. I just like how the stuff smells. The salesman tells me that the shampoo and conditioner I use were\u00a0discontinued\u00a0and are no longer available. I walked around the small shop looking at the wares. They recently rearranged the shelves by gender and product type. I was testing a green Eucalyptus body wash when the salesman said to me \u201cA lot of women won\u2019t try a product that is in our men\u2019s line.\u201d I was busted. We both knew I wouldn\u2019t try a product in their women\u2019s line. What makes a soap or a shampoo gendered or androgynous? The color? The fragrance? The name? Is it all marketing? Why would I consider the Black Peppercorn body wash but not the Pink Pepperpod? Which would I buy for Donna? How do I separate what I like from which side of the store it is on and how does that change my perception of what it smells like? Does pink have a scent? Is it good on butches? President Roosevelt, age 2 1/2, in 1884. This type of outfit was considered normal for a boy. Why should I hesitate to buy a pink body wash if I like how it smells? How did pink and blue get so charged? According to Jo Paoletti, the author of Pink and Blue, before 1900, in the United States, babies wore white (easy to bleach) and all infants/young children wore dresses (see FDR on the left). In the early 1900\u2019s there was an effort to gender pastel colors, but it wasn\u2019t until 1940 that pink and blue became binary colors. Starting around 1985, color coding for children\u2019s clothing became increasingly binary and inflexible. Color coding has spread to almost every product marketed to children. Why color code your soaps along the gender binary? Why make me have a Riley like rant\u00a0just because I want to buy some shampoo? In the end, I bought a bottle of amber \u201cCleanshine Quillaja Hairwash\u201d and a bottle of bright yellow \u201cFresh Bushukan Citrus Body Wash.\u201d From the men\u2019s side. Next time I\u2019m in Integral Yoga, I\u2019ll pick up some gender-neutral unscented deodorant, cinnamon toothpaste, and white dental floss. \u00a0I\u2019m not going to try either the Barbie or the Spiderman toothpaste anytime soon. Notes: I am in the middle of Jo Paoletti\u2019s \u201cPink and Blue: Telling the Boys from the Girls in America\u201d. It is a fascinating and informative book about the history of children\u2019s clothing. I also like her blog. I found out about the Riley rant while I was telling Donna about the book. We were sharing a smoked tofu panini at \u2018sNice Cafe and the guy sitting next to us interrupted our conversation to show us the video on You Tube.
