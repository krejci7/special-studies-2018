I am shedding my winter layers. I am molting like a\u00a0snake. Any day now it will be warm enough to walk around in jeans and a T-shirt. The pear trees are flowering. I got caught in a sudden rain shower that cleared as fast as it started. Afterwards, I smelled the warm wet sidewalk. It is a summer smell. I am not ready for summer. It is impossible to accurately explain\u00a0body dysphoria\u00a0to someone who never had it. Each time I catch a glimpse of myself I expect to see someone else. My dysphoria\u00a0is visual. My dysphoria is dissociative. I\u2019ve learned I can manage it by keeping my hair short, wearing masculine clothes, de-emphasizing my breasts, and avoiding mirrors and reflective surfaces. I\u2019ve learned I can manage it by avoiding bathrooms, locker rooms, dressing rooms, gendered spaces. I have expended a lot of energy manging my dysphoria, but it won\u2019t go away. I look in the mirror and I can\u2019t line myself up with the image reflected back at me. When I see pictures of myself I don\u2019t see myself, I only see someone who\u00a0I can identify\u00a0as me, but really isn\u2019t me. Donna tries to take pictures of me on the sly. She knows if I stop and pose the result will be false; a picture of someone else. At its most benign, my dysphoria\u00a0is grating. It is like chewing your salad and coming across a grain of sand. Some days my dysphoria\u00a0is disruptive\u00a0and dangerous, as if I am walking down Madison Avenue naked. I panic and I want to hide, but everyone can see what is wrong with me. There are days when I try to get dressed and everything looks wrong and feels wrong. When\u00a0I change my shirt four times and still don\u2019t want to go out. When I feel self-conscious and critical. When everything feels fake and nothing feels authentic. When the only thing that works is to break out the flannel and dress like a boy. I\u2019ve managed my dysphoria\u00a0using the medical model of \u201cprimum\u00a0non nocere\u201d\u00a0which translates as\u00a0\u201cFirst, do no harm.\u201d In\u00a0practice, it means\u00a0that sometimes it is better to do nothing, or to do as little as possible, than to risk\u00a0causing more harm than good. I talked about\u00a0my dysphoria\u00a0in therapy. I modified my wardrobe so I don\u2019t wear stuff I don\u2019t like. I legally changed my name. I experimented with sports bras and binders to find an everyday comfortable solution (double design co.\u00a0purchased from Les Love Boat\u00a0in Taiwan). I inched incrementally sideways. I have not done anything medical. Is it possible for me to stop managing my dysphoria and to embrace it, as I embrace being butch and being transgender? Can I learn to live with it because it is a part of me? Can I acknowledge it and let it go, take away its power, render it harmless?\u00a0Or is that futile? Should I try to exorcise\u00a0my dysphoria? \u00a0Would top surgery defang it forever? That is the $11,000 question. I\u2019ve tried to get by. As if I deserved to survive, but am not entitled to be made whole. I\u2019ve\u00a0never\u00a0asked myself what being made whole would mean. It is too big and too open-ended a question. \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
