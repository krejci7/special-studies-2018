I have a mental list of stuff I ought to do that I didn\u2019t get around to doing in 2015. Some items are holdovers from 2014, perpetually on the verge of almost being attended to. I had great hopes for 2015, but it was a hard year. I\u2019m glad it is over. I\u2019m not going to sugar coat it. Donna\u2019s open heart surgery, hospitalization, and recovery took a lot out of me. I was discouraged (and furious) on Labor Day weekend, when she missed a step, fell, and broke her ankle. She ended up in the hospital again, and then in rehab. She came home in a wheelchair, and slowly progressed to using a walker, and last week to using a cane. I love her, but I don\u2019t love being her caretaker. We got on each other\u2019s nerves. We adjusted. We are getting back to normal. We didn\u2019t go to Italy (we cancelled the trip after Donna\u2019s fall). I didn\u2019t make time for ice skating. I never finished cleaning out my room (I did clear out a closet, a dresser, and take 6 quarts of coins ($712) to the bank). I let the mail pile up out of control again. I let my legal and financial paperwork fester. I didn\u2019t call my brother. I did go for my top surgery revision, see a doctor for a physical, get a colonoscopy, maintain my weight, and go to the gym irregularly enough to not lose ground. I swam in the ocean in board shorts and a rash guard. I didn\u2019t go to hell in a handbasket. I\u2019m in a satisfactory place to start 2016. My wish for 2016 is to not set foot in an emergency room, hospital, or nursing home. I wish for Donna to feel strong enough to travel. I wish for a lower voice and for all men\u2019s shoes to come in a size 7 (EU 40). I wish for a cloak of invisibility every time I walk into a bathroom, locker room, or dressing room. I wish for Gracie to stop barking as soon as I tell her to hush, not when she finishes the chorus. I want to reschedule the trip to Italy. I want to go ice skating in Central Park. I want to work with a dog trainer to get a handle on some of Gracie\u2019s bad habits (she is impatient and petulant, insists of being\u00a0the center of attention, and uses selective listening). I want to stop judging other people\u2019s transitions \u2013 I don\u2019t want to rank \u201cpassing\u201d and medical transition at the top and everything else below it. I want to be respectful of all authentic manifestations of gender (regardless of how close they are to mine). I don\u2019t want to question anyone else\u2019s transness or butchness. I want to keep an open mind about Testosterone but I don\u2019t want to start it just because it is on someone else\u2019s bucket\u00a0list. I need to clean up my room and throw stuff out or give it away (excess books, CDs, dust bunnies, old electronics, and junk stored under the bed and in desk drawers/file cabinet). I need to go through the bags and piles of mail and keep only what I need for my taxes and insurance. I need to see a cardiologist. I need to evaluate\u00a0how much I spent this year. I need to take care of the loose ends of my name change. Aside from the wishes, which are not within my control, nothing seems impossible. Other than training Gracie, nothing even seems challenging, except interrupting my inertia and starting one task before I get distracted by something else. Notes: Ivan E. Coyote\u2019s video \u201cWe all need a safe place to pee\u201d\u00a0speaks to my wish (and the wishes of many butch, transgender, and/or gender non-conforming people).\u00a0\u00a0I hope Ivan performs in NYC in 2016.
