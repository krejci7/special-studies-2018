I love snuggly dogs. Dog lovers can be divided up into kissers\u00a0and those who think getting\u00a0licked on the face\u00a0by a dog is gross. Dog\u00a0lovers can be divided\u00a0up into rescuers and purchasers.\u00a0The rescuers also need to be rescued. I am a kissy rescuer. Just one problem. Gracie doesn\u2019t kiss. She will air kiss, she will nuzzle me, but she\u00a0will only\u00a0lick me after I eat cheese. She tolerates me kissing her, but I know she doesn\u2019t like it. I\u2019d kiss you back if you weren\u2019t so needy. I take Gracie to the dog run almost everyday.\u00a0\u00a0I have people friends and canine friends there.\u00a0 I wave and say hi to the humans, but there are a number of dogs who whine\u00a0and\u00a0mob me when I come in.\u00a0Mickey and Lulu\u00a0always demand kisses and scruffing\u00a0up.\u00a0Gracie is a jealous bitch.\u00a0She will\u00a0try to worm her way in-between me and the other pups. When it comes to dogs, I am polyamorous. I can\u2019t get enough love. When it comes to women, I have room only for one. Lucky Donna. Licking is a submissive gesture for dogs; they learn it from their mothers. As soon as they are born, their mothers lick them to stimulate their breathing. Licking stimulates them to \u201cdo their business\u201d.\u00a0The dam will\u00a0lick the puppies\u00a0to clean them and to show affection.\u00a0My family was not a kissy family. I learned how to kiss in 11th grade when I fell in love with Stella. She was a good kisser. Donna is a terrific kisser.\u00a0I could tell on the first kiss. Gracie\u2019s submissive gesture is to roll over and show her belly. When I come home, instead of running to the door to greet me, she stays where she is and gives me a \u201cpeel me a grape\u201d look. When I call her, she gets up, stretches her legs, ambles over to me, and then flips over and gives me a \u201cJamie boy, rub my belly\u201d look. Gracie is a femme. I am a sucker for femmes. I like being seduced. Even by my dog. ", "feedtitle": "Page 19 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
