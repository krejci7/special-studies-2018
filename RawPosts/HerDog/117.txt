It is deep seated. The girls at P.S. 40 Manhattan were a mean bunch, a nasty clique. When I see a group of girls together, I flinch. I don\u2019t see them as adorable or playful. I don\u2019t trust them. I can\u2019t remember back to when girls were just girls. I went to school, from kindergarten through sixth grade, with the same twenty or so girls. Line up, recess, lunch, dismissal. Outside the classroom I was a target. Push, elbow, poke. Eww, keep away from me, you\u2019ve got cooties.\u00a0 Teased and shunned. For being fat, for wearing ugly clothes, for being a misfit. Eww what\u2019s that smell? Get away.\u00a0There were two ringleaders who kept the other girls in line. They weren\u2019t girly girls, they weren\u2019t rich girls, they weren\u2019t smart girls, but they were good at what they did. I had no friends at school. Wendy and Julie saw to it. Don\u2019t let her touch the ball, we\u2019ll have to decontaminate it.\u00a0I did not want to play their games. I did not want to sit at their table. I see London, I see France, What is in your underpants? I did not want them to police my behavior or my gender (if I\u2019d only had the terms to describe it then). Before I started kindergarten, before I knew the jargon, before some of the jargon existed, before I could formulate the words, I knew I was not like them. I was a boy and I was attracted to women. If I didn\u2019t have the thoughts concurrently, I intertwined them quickly. Besides thinking I was a boy, I started hating being a girl, and hating all things associated with girls, especially the ones at P.S. 40. This included all things pink or frilly, girl\u2019s games, girl\u2019s books, and girl\u2019s behavior. I have no tolerance for cattiness, name-calling, cliques, or ostracism. I know that these are not genetic traits. I know that boys are just as vicious and petty, but my tormentors were girls. I\u2019d like to be less judgmental of girls who are girly. I \u2018m comfortable being butch, being masculine, and being transgender. I\u2019d like to distance myself from girls and femininity without scorning them. I don\u2019t want to begrudge any child a pink tutu or a sparkly wand. I don\u2019t want to be a hater. I clomp around in construction boots. I assiduously avoid anything feminine (unless it is from the men\u2019s department).\u00a0No one is trying to dress me in pink tulle or make me attend ballet class. I don\u2019t experience any pressure to be more feminine or female appearing than I am except when I am in a \u201cwomen\u2019s only space\u201d e.g. a bathroom, a locker room, or a dressing room. Who gets to decide if I am a woman or a man, both or neither? I do. Neither the Macy\u2019s sales associate counting the number of shirts I want to try on, the receptionist handing out towels at the gym, nor the women on line to use the toilets get to decide. Nor do Wendy and Julie. Nor do the RadFems.\u00a0 In the August 4, 2014 edition of The New Yorker there is an article titled \u201cWhat is a Woman?\u201d When I read the title, I was hoping for an article about sex and gender, chromosomes and hormones, fluidity versus the binary, or how we conceptualize our identity. I was not expecting a\u00a0biased and reactionary article about Radfems and their insistence that trans women are really still men. Or an article that conflates being transgender with having erotic compulsions. The article did not discuss legal identity versus social identity. Or who gets to decide if we are men or women (medical doctors, psychologists, judges, or government agencies), or what happens when policies are personalized, vary by county and state, and are inconsistently applied. We will have to continue writing those articles ourselves. Note: Autostraddle ran a critique of the article\u00a0here\u00a0and Julia Serrano wrote a scathing Op-Ed piece about her experiences being interviewed by The New Yorker in The Advocate here.\u00a0 ", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
