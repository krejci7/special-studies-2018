She was abusive. I thought it was my fault. She wanted a normal child and she got me instead. My mother felt cheated. She wanted a daughter. I was supposed to be sweet and polite, neat and nicely dressed, smart but deferential. I was supposed to\u00a0go along with the plan. My brother complied. I resisted. Resistance is not the same as doing what you want. \u00a0 She would suggest I do something, then threaten me, then yell at me, then punish me. Little things. Why don\u2019t you want to join the Brownies? Don\u2019t you want a Barbie? Why don\u2019t you put on the dress your grandmother bought you? What is wrong with you? Why can\u2019t you be like the other girls? Did you look at yourself in the mirror? You can\u2019t go out like that. You can\u2019t go out until you apologize. You want something to cry about? I\u2019ll give you something to cry about. You\u2019ll be sorry you ever set foot on this earth. I\u2019ll rip you limb from limb. I knew I was the problem. I knew there was something wrong with me. My mother was judgmental about everyone and everything. I thought that was normal. I thought all adults walked around looking at everyone else and critiquing them. Their mannerisms, their clothes, their speech, their actions. My mother found fault with every restaurant, every play, every concert. She said she had high standards. My mother was a sourpuss. I tried to eke out small pleasures. I read. I listened to music. I didn\u2019t show a lot of exuberance or enthusiasm. I kept quiet about things I liked. I didn\u2019t want her to spoil them. I learned how to constrain myself. I struggle to turn it off. To stop judging myself. To stop judging others. My mother said she would have\u00a0been satisfied if I only appeared to be conventional. If I wore dresses to work, put on lipstick, worked on Wall Street. Even if I was a lesbian. But she could not tolerate my obvious queerness, my obvious masculinity. I struggle to stop judging my butchness and my transness, and to stop judging how others choose to define and manage their gender and sexual identities. To accept that there is nothing inherently wrong with me; that I am not the problem. To let go of trying to change my nature. To embrace my contradictions instead of trying to constrain\u00a0them. I need to accept that I am unwilling to see myself as a\u00a0girl/woman despite all physical evidence to the contrary. That\u00a0I expect to see a boy/tomboy in the mirror while I keep seeing an adult. That\u00a0I cross-dress and present as butch/masculine although I want to be invisible (i.e. I don\u2019t want to be seen as a freak or deal with other people\u2019s confusion). My mother would have a lot to say about all of this, none of it helpful. She would blame me for being naive, unrealistic, and lazy (unwilling to do the work to change). She\u2019d tell me that it was time to turn over a new leaf and start acting like a lady. I have to keep reminding myself that she was wrong. That she was trying to crush me. That I survived her, with my contradictions intact. Note: Next week Donna and I will be on vacation in Oaxaca, Mexico. I will be will be reading, but not posting. Donna will be exuberant and enthusiastic and I will try to not constrain myself. Particularly in the central market.  ", "feedtitle": "Page 16 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
