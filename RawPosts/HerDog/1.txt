After writing once a week for four years. I\u2019ve finally decided is time to switch things up and stop posting on schedule and only post when I feel like it. I like blogging. I like the community and the intimacy. I like reading about other people\u2019s lives, especially people who are trying to figure out how to live authentically without blowing the rest of their lives to smithereens. But blogging takes a lot of time, and at this moment in history I want to focus on political activism and building community. I don\u2019t want to resent how much time I\u2019m spending writing. Four years ago, when I started this blog, I had just legally changed my name and accepted that I was trans. I was struggling to hold onto my relationship with Donna. I had read enough books to practically get a master\u2019s degree in queer and transgender studies, but I couldn\u2019t figure out what I wanted to do about my gender identity and gender expression. I set it up as a false dichotomy; stay butch or transition to trans man. It took me a while to see that although I always wanted to be a boy, I didn\u2019t necessarily want to be a man. That there was a lot of space, and a lot of room for experimentation, in between butch and trans man. I am still exploring that space. I haven\u2019t run out of ideas for blog posts. Today, I was thinking about letting go of the self-imposed pressure to decide about testosterone (not making a decision is still making a decision) and my fear that not going on testosterone means that I\u2019m not really trans. Another post I want to write is about setting high expectations for myself and dealing with my disappointment when I can\u2019t live up to them. I also want to write about what it is like to do political work with LGBTQ folk I know from ACT UP 25 years ago (and anti-war work 15 years ago) and their difficulty accepting that I am in a different place now than I was then (including getting my name right!). Donna protesting outside Trump\u2019s hotel. Donna and I are also working together this time, along with our friend Alexis. It is great to be protesting with friends. The political group we are working with is Rise & Resist. It is so new that the website isn\u2019t up, and you don\u2019t get anything when you Google it. The Facebook page for Rise & Resist is here. It isn\u2019t an LGBTQ group, but there are a lot of LGBTQ activists in it (the B and the T part of the acronym have been pretty quiet). There are a handful of people who look like they are trans (I know, I shouldn\u2019t judge based on how people look) and at least two other people who introduced themselves with they pronouns. I\u2019m hoping to chat them up so we can support each other. It is hard to know what to do to fight Trump/Pence and the Republican agenda. It is easy to get frustrated and sink into despair. It is easy for us to turn on each other. I\u2019ve been in groups that have self-imploded, and I\u2019m hoping that Rise & Resist can work through those problems. Stay tuned.
