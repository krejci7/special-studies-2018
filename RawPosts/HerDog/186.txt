I started out butch, I incorporated trans*, I am still muddling through. Either I will figure it out or I will just keep reading and thinking. What does it mean to me (this week)\u00a0to say that I am trans* but I am not transitioning? I\u2019ve been reading the classic text, Harry Benjamin\u2018s \u201cThe Transsexual Phenomenon\u201d. \u00a0It is out of print (and very dated since it was written in 1966 post Jorgensen but pre Stonewall); you can download it \u00a0from\u00a0tgmeds.org.uk/downs/phenomenon.pdf (I would provide the link but I got bounced out of the WordPress Reader last week for linking to something that annoyed the system and I am not taking any chances this week). The is the link to last week\u2019s post. The simplest description of transgender is that what is \u201cbetween the ears\u201d doesn\u2019t match what is \u201cbetween the legs\u201d \u2013 i.e. your gender doesn\u2019t match your sex. My gloves don\u2019t match my shoes. But it is way more complex than that. rubber duckies (Photo credit: Leonard John Matthews) Benjamin breaks \u201csex\u201d down into chromosomal, genetic, anatomical, legal, gonadal, germinal, endocrine, psychological, and social sex (he explains his use of these terms in the book).\u00a0In layperson\u2019s terms your genetic make-up (XX, XY, etc.), your exterior organs, your reproductive organs and what they produce (sperm or eggs), your hormones (androgen and estrogen), your birth certificate and legal documents, whether you were raised as a girl or boy, what gender\u00a0you feel you are, and how you present yourself. Most people\u2019s ducks line up and they never give it a thought. My ducks run circles around me and are a bunch of little anarchists. For years I tried to get them in order (accept being a woman and occasionally dress like one), and then I relented and let them run amok (accept that I have always thought I was a boy and dress like one). I live with the chaos better than I lived with the repression. The dilemma is, if you accept that you are trans*, you can never get everything from genetic sex to social sex to line up. Each person has to decide, how much F and how much M. Where to start and where to stop. What feels authentic and what feels false. So far, my compromise has been to accept that I am trans*, change my name, ditch my honorifics,\u00a0wear masculine clothes (nothing new here), and reduce my dysphoria\u00a0by avoiding situations that make it flare up. I don\u2019t know how\u00a0I will change in the future. I don\u2019t see myself following the contemporary transman narrative (name change, pronouns, testosterone, top-surgery, gender marker), but I\u2019ve already done the first thing on the list, and boy does it feel good.
