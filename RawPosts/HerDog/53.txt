The odds are stacked against me. The game ranks secondary sex characteristics over gender expression and gender presentation. It ignores my intent. It doesn\u2019t recognize the middle ground. When asked \u201cWhat are your preferred gender pronouns (PGPs)?\u201d I usually stammer out \u201cthey\u201d. I hate pronouns. Most people use feminine pronouns when they talk about me. It doesn\u2019t feel right, but I don\u2019t stop them. Three years into writing this blog, I remain pronoun challenged. I am not comfortable with either he or she, or Sir or Ma\u2019am, although Ma\u2019am is the worst. I\u2019m OK with they, Jamie, or nothing. \u201cNothing\u201d is easy with honorifics and titles. On forms, I leave the title box blank. If I have to fill in something, I use Dr. or Prof. I haven\u2019t seen Mx. on a form yet, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d use it.\u00a0\u201cNothing\u201d is difficult with pronouns. I choose to wear masculine clothing, have a masculine haircut, and carry myself in a masculine manner, but I don\u2019t use masculine pronouns. I conflate masculine pronouns with taking testosterone. I read as masculine, but not necessarily male. I like how I look. I don\u2019t do anything to make it easy to read me as female. When I go out I get Sir\u2019d and Ma\u2019am\u2019d and a combination of the two. I cringe when people apologize after calling me Sir. Delta, painted by Frank Stella, 1958 Last week, Donna and I went to see the Frank Stella show at the Whitney Museum. Donna used a wheelchair provided by the museum. I pushed. We moved slowly through the show, tethered together. An intimate way to look. What struck me was not Stella\u2019s painting, but his explanation of his work \u201cWhat you see is what you see.\u201d Stella was one of the\u00a0first painters to break away from Abstract Expressionism. Art critics called his work Minimalism, because critics like to label things. The Tate Modern defines Minimalism as \u201cno attempt is made to represent an outside reality, the artist wants the viewer to respond only to what is in front of them. The medium (or material) from which it is made, and the form of the work is the reality.\u201d I want people to see what they see. Not to judge me by whether I \u201cpass\u201d as a man. I want them to stop trying to find the mark that identifies me as female. To let go of the one drop rule, the rule that says that my sex assigned at birth trumps everything else. I want them to see my reality. I am not someone who should be\u00a0called Ma\u2019am. I know a handful of people who identify as either non-binary, genderqueer, or gender non-conforming. Some of them use he. Some of them use they. Some go by she. If you tried to line them up and guess their preferred pronouns, chances are you\u2019d get them wrong. It doesn\u2019t correlate with how masculine or how feminine they look. It correlates with their reality, and how willing they are to insist that other people respect it. Notes: What you see is what you see\u00a0is a precursor of What you see is what you get (WYSIWG).\u00a0Or as the Dramatics sang it, Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get. The U.K. is ahead of the U.S. in using gender neutral honorifics such as Mx., however, according to this article in Time, Mx. is slowly worming its way into American usage. Misconceptions about Mx., from the blog Spacious Perspicacious, is an excellent short analysis of the word. ", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
