Lena was a great dog. \u00a0 She was a shepherd mix (a hiker upstate told me that she thought Lena was a Malinois Shepherd). \u00a0Her original owner died of AIDS, and his brother had promised to find Lena a good home. \u00a0I saw a flyer about her on a table at an ACT-UP meeting. \u00a0When I brought her home, Donna said it was as if I had brought my new mistress home to live with us. \u00a0I was hooked. \u00a0I was finally a boy with a dog. \u00a0Every morning we went out and played ball. \u00a0We came home and hung out on the couch and read. \u00a0I stayed a boy and Lena grew old. \u00a0She was sixteen when I put her to sleep. I needed another dog, but Donna was not ready. \u00a0I was miserable. \u00a0I missed Lena. \u00a0I missed being a boy. \u00a0I felt disconnected from everything. \u00a0I snuck onto the Internet to look at rescue dogs. \u00a0Finally Donna said \u201cI can\u2019t stand it anymore, get a dog\u201d. \u00a0She said she\u2019d like a black dog with ears that hung down and that was smaller than Lena and had a white spot on her chest. \u00a0I wanted a dog that I could take to the dog run and was good with kids. \u00a0I wanted a rescue. \u00a0I wanted another Lena. \u00a0But instead I got Gracie. I adopted her \u201csight unseen\u201d from All About Labs via Petfinders. \u00a0She was supposed to be a ten month old Flat Coat Retriever mix, but when she popped out of the rescue truck she looked like a Border Collie that fell into the inkwell. \u00a0I call her my Borderline Collie. \u00a0I call her the Black Enigma. \u00a0She loves a belly rub. \u00a0She won\u2019t play fetch, catch, or Frisbee. \u00a0I love Gracie. \u00a0I\u2019m her boy. The first time I brought her into my apartment she ran figure 8\u2019s in the living room, jumping up on all the furniture. \u00a0Then she threw herself at my feet, rolled over, and wanted me to rub her belly. \u00a0She wriggled on the floor and grunted like a wild little pig. \u00a0Then she barked at me until I rubbed her belly. \u00a0You can guess who was trained first. \u00a0I should have called this blog A Dog and Her Boy. \u00a0It might be more accurate.
