I like getting shampooed\u00a0and having my scalp rubbed. I like the\u00a0\u201cgotcha\u201d sound\u00a0of the scissors; the buzz of the razor on my neck. I like the moment when the\u00a0loose hair is brushed\u00a0from my shoulders, the\u00a0cape is whisked off, and I put my glasses on to\u00a0see how I look. Haircuts make me feel butch. Haircuts make me feel like a boy. I am still getting used to seeing gray. For years, I only noticed the gray when my hair grew out; now it remains gray after the cut. I don\u2019t want to color it. Boys don\u2019t color their hair. I\u2019ll live with the salt and pepper. I get\u00a0a haircut\u00a0cut every four weeks. Alan knows how I like it; he has tamed my cowlick. Alan is an \u201cold school\u201d gay. \u00a0He\u00a0started cutting hair\u00a0in the 1960\u2019s, when becoming a hairdresser was one of\u00a0the\u00a0few viable career routes for a sissy boy. As a teenager he collected the\u00a0signatures of actors and actresses in Shubert Alley. Last year the New York Times\u00a0published a short article about him. Alan is always trying to get me to try \u201cproduct.\u201d He tells me not to worry,\u00a0it is for guys with short hair. It gives your hair a sheen and keeps it in place. I don\u2019t listen to him. I want to shower, towel dry my hair, run my hand over it, and be done. I don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time in front of the mirror. I have short hair in my childhood pictures, starting as a toddler. My mother claimed it was easier to take care of. I usually had some form of a pixie cut, or a bowl cut with short bangs. When I started school, she wanted me to wear either a page-boy or a bob. My mother\u00a0was determined\u00a0to have me grow my hair out for first grade. I cut it myself. For a five year old, I did a pretty good job. A stylist needed to finish it up and even it out; in the end it was\u00a0as short as I was aiming for. My mother cringed when people called me a boy, but I was allowed to keep my hair short. I grew my hair out on my own accord, when I was twelve. My brother wore his hair long; he looked like a rock star. I was a copycat. The problem was that he looked like a drummer and I looked like a teenage girl. When I cut my hair, I went to a barber shop instead of a hair salon. I pointed to a picture on the wall and said \u201cI want my hair to look like that.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019ve kept it short and cropped ever since.\u00a0According to the chart, I have a forward brush style (first haircut on the left, top row). Before puberty, all I needed to do to \u201cpass\u201d for a boy was to have a good hair cut and\u00a0the right\u00a0clothes. I wish it was still that easy. Through my mid-twenties, I was frequently read as a teenage boy. Now I am often superficially read as male, but it is fleeting and awkward. Without taking testosterone, I am unable to sustain it. There are too many gender markers that I am missing; voice, facial hair, height, and muscle/fat distribution. That is alright. I know how I feel. I experience the magic every time I get a haircut.
