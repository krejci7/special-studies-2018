Donna broke her ankle in two places on Saturday. We won\u2019t be going anywhere anytime soon. I\u2019m angry with her for falling, for rushing, for not watching her step, for being Donna. She was on her way to the swimming hole, and came back to get sunscreen. She missed the step from the porch to the walkway. I didn\u2019t see it happen. I just heard her cry out. I was planning on staying home and writing a post about going back to Venice. Instead, we took a trip to the emergency room. Our first trip abroad together, in 1983, was to Italy. We flew into Rome and took the train to Venice. When we arrived in Venice there was a crowd outside the train station, and the Vaporetto\u00a0weren\u2019t running. We arrived on the first Sunday in September. In the middle of the Regata Storico. There was nothing to do except look at the boats and wait for\u00a0the Grand Canal to reopen so we could get to our\u00a0pensionne. I ate my first gelato. I learned a lot about Donna on that trip. I learned that she loves the unplanned and unexpected, that she likes to change the itinerary,\u00a0and\u00a0that she likes to travel without reservations. We were going to stay in Venice\u00a0for five nights but had such a good time that we ended up staying for ten nights, and skipped Emilia-Romagna (Bologna and Ravenna) before decamping for Tuscany. Donna doesn\u2019t like guidebooks. She hates lists of \u201c10 things You Must Do In \u2026\u201d, even though she\u2019d want to do five or six of them anyway. She thinks of herself as a traveler not a sightseer. She is fond of Romanesque churches and Roman mosaics. She finds them in out-of-the-way places. We go out of our way to visit them. After Venice, we were going to drive through Umbria and Le Marche. If you are in a long-term\u00a0relationship you probably have a set of meaningful one word phrases you both use. For us, they are\u00a0Grazalema and Bologna. Grazalema is a village\u00a0in Cadiz,\u00a0Spain.\u00a0It is a \u201cwhite town\u201d surrounded by the Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park. It doesn\u2019t have a famous church or museum. We stopped for lunch, en route from Arcos de la Frontera to Zahara. We ordered\u00a0a delicious roast loin of pork, drank a glass of red\u00a0wine, and sat in the main plaza watching town life.\u00a0Donna thought Grazalema would make a great base for a couple of days. We could go to Zahara on a day\u00a0trip. I offered only pro forma resistance. We stayed. Grazalema is our\u00a0shorthand for discovering a wonderful place by accident. Serendipity. Bologna is my term\u00a0for giving up unknown\u00a0future pleasures because Donna changed the itinerary. I wanted to go there because of the food.\u00a0I will never get there\u00a0because something better will always crop up and get in the way. I will never be able to make a convincing argument to go there. Bologna is what falls off the list. Even though it is my idea, I\u2019m not convinced that going to Venice is a good idea. Nothing is ever as good the second time around. There is no guarantee that I will fall for its charms. I might be bothered by the crowds of\u00a0tourists. I might be disappointed. It won\u2019t be exactly how I remember it. Donna insisted that we buy travel insurance. I bought it literally two hours before she fell. If all goes well, we will be reimbursed for our expenses and be able to reschedule\u00a0the trip in the spring. Meanwhile, we can dream, eat gelato, and read about the back roads of Umbria\u00a0and Le Marche. Notes: Welcome to Rehab is a riff on Welcome to Holland, written by Emily Perl Kingsley, about parenting a child with Down\u2019s Syndrome. I first came across it while reading Andrew Solomon\u2019s excellent book Far From The Tree (about parenting all sorts of kids including gay and trans kids). Some people love the piece, some people hate it.\u00a0Some people accept they will never get to Italy, and some people create Italy wherever they are. Donna broke her ankle on Saturday, had surgery on Sunday, and is in residential rehab. She is not in a lot of pain, but she can\u2019t put any weight on the bad ankle. She should come home in a week or two, equipped with a knee scooter. ", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
