Blue jeans, black T-shirt, blue chambray work shirt, and gray wool socks. I took off my belt, my sneakers, and my watch. I emptied my pockets, put my quart-size bag of toiletries and my electronics on the tray. I waited my turn, walked into the machine, spread my legs, put up my hands, counted to three, and when the TSO (Transportation Security Officer) nodded, I walked out to retrieve my stuff. Not so fast. The officer ordered me to go through the machine again. Then\u00a0another officer\u00a0patted\u00a0me down very thoroughly, particularly around my groin and my chest binder, and swabbed\u00a0my hand for explosives. The TSO originally pressed the blue button for male and when lots of yellow squares appeared on the screen, she realized she made a mistake, and put me through again pressing the pink button for female. Donna overheard the discussion between the officers. It was neither private nor discreet. They did not realize she was with me. The last three times I\u2019ve traveled, I\u2019ve had my palm swabbed for explosives. It wasn\u2019t random. Donna waltzed through. My\u00a0gender is seen as a potential threat to Homeland Security; hers is not. The USA uses Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) machines at some checkpoints. The TSA (Transportation Security Administration) video states that AIT is used to search for concealed weapons, explosives, and other \u201cpotential threats.\u201d According to the manufacturer, AIT machines can handle between 200 and 300\u00a0people an hour, although the lane never moves that fast. Each time the officer has to press either the blue button or the pink one. If, from their perspective, they press the wrong one, it isn\u2019t their fault. I dressed in blue, they pressed blue. If you wear a binder, if you pack, or if your body shape doesn\u2019t match the colored button, you may trigger a \u201cgenital anomaly\u201d alert. This draws the attention of the TSO and the people behind you in line. Anomalies were not discussed on the TSA webpage on Transgender Travelers.\u00a0The National Center for Transgender Equality Airport Security Update\u00a0provides some information. It is not my responsibility to tell the TSO which button to push, or to present more femininely, to make it easier. They are supposed to\u00a0police for terrorism, not gender. I\u2019d already shown security my boarding pass and my passport. All of my documents match. My genitals and my gender expression don\u2019t. The TSA presumes that there is something wrong if the two don\u2019t match. The implied message is that gender non-conforming and transgender people are a potential threat to security because we are hiding something. It wasn\u2019t so long ago that the government routinely denied security clearances to gay men and lesbians\u00a0(who couldn\u2019t be trusted because they could be blackmailed). I know there are people who will ask \u201cWell, what did you expect?\u201d They think my discomfort and inconvenience is a small price to pay. They may believe racial and religious profiling makes the country safer. It doesn\u2019t. It reinforces the idea that the people profiled are more dangerous than the \u201caverage American.\u201d I present in a way that makes me feel comfortable. When I am Sir\u2019d, I feel seen, but I am on guard for a correction or an apology. When I am Ma\u2019am\u2019d, I cringe on the inside. When I get put through security twice and swabbed for explosives, I remember that I am a gender outlaw and a potential threat to society. Note: While writing the post I wanted to use the correct title for the TSA employees, which turns out to be officer, not agent or screener. I found this out by looking up \u201cTSA Job Titles\u201d and reading the description of what a TSO (Transportation Security Officer) does. My favorite part is where it describes two of the challenges of being a TSO as \u201cworking with minimal staffing\u201d and \u201cworking with outdated, old equipment.\u201d Safety first!
