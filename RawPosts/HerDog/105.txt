No Bat Mitzvah, no Sweet Sixteen, no Prom, no graduation party, no wedding. No ceremony to mark the crossing of a line, the shift in status from childhood to adulthood. No ancient rituals, no reading of texts, no scarifications. Maybe scarifications. I\u2019m counting down the days to top surgery (December 8). If top surgery is my rite of passage, it is not clear to me what is on the other side of the shore. I\u2019ve been low-key about it because I don\u2019t want to put a hex on it. I am thankful that Donna remains nominally onboard and\u00a0reconciled to my going through with it.\u00a0I\u2019ve read up on tips for top surgery and what to expect while you are recovering. I \u2018m making a list of what I need to do around the house to prepare. I want to make it as easy on Donna as possible. Over the last fifteen years I\u2019ve had four surgeries (one to repair torn knee ligaments, two to remove fibroids, and a partial hysterectomy). I learned that I get nauseous and depressed from anesthesia. I learned that I am impatient to recover, that I get bored staying at home, and that I don\u2019t like to ask for help. But, I am channelling all of my anxiety about top surgery\u00a0into the realization that I\u00a0don\u2019t have the right outfit to come home from the hospital in. Or for lounging around in while I recover. \u00a0Or for taking a walk to cool my cabin fever. I threw out my old sweat pants last year. I found an ancient pair of flannel PJ bottoms and my moccasins in a storage box.\u00a0I have some soft loose button-down shirts.\u00a0I have my gym shorts. Otherwise, all I wear are denim jeans, corduroy jeans, and twill cargo pants. I\u2019m going to have limited use of my arms. I\u00a0probably won\u2019t want to\u00a0pull up my jeans and deal with buttons and a zipper fly\u00a0right after surgery. Or take naps in my jeans.\u00a0I need a layette set.\u00a0I need a couple of pairs of sweatpants, and a light zip-up hoodie. I have a vision of the top surgery stork bringing me home from the hospital and dropping me down the chimney. Swaddled in yellow and green. All fresh and new. Innocent. Reality check: Donna will bring me home in a taxi and I\u2019ll take the elevator to our apartment. I am skeptical of born agains. Skeptical of people who assume that transitioning will solve all of their problems, that they can leave their old life behind in a cloud of dust. Still, I think of top surgery as a way to reclaim a part of myself\u00a0distorted by puberty. What should a butch or genderqueer person expect to get out of top surgery? I will be happy if I can look at myself in a\u00a0mirror larger than the medicine cabinet, and if I can stand up straight and breathe deep without feeling self-conscious about my chest.\u00a0I don\u2019t expect top surgery to\u00a0alleviate my social anxiety\u00a0or make up for the traumas of my childhood. It will likely complicate my already complicated presence in women\u2019s bathrooms, dressing rooms, and locker rooms. Despite this, I think looking queerer, and less female-bodied, will feel right. At least to me. I am looking forward to never wearing a bra or a binder again. To the freedom of an unrestricted chest. I\u2019m going to donate my binders to\u00a0In a Bind, a group that collects binders and distributes them to trans youth who need them. I\u2019m going to donate my bras to\u00a0Free the Girls,\u00a0a group that collects new and lightly used bras and assists women in developing countries to resell them in their local used-clothing markets. I hope they find good homes. Note: While thinking about what to do with my binders and bras, the two things that came to mind were burning or composting them. I vaguely remembered that \u201cbra burning\u201d is a myth. This video\u00a0debunks the famous \u201cbra burning\u201d demonstration at the Miss America contest in 1968. This site explains (to ignorant fools like me) why most bras are not compostable. ", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
