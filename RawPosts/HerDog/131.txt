She was in full young professional drag. A skirt suit and pumps. A look of panic flashed across her face. She started to turn around to walk out of the bathroom, and then turned around and gave me a long hard look. She didn\u2019t say anything. She walked past me, entered a stall and closed the door. Because I was already inside the women\u2019s restroom, she assumed she had made the mistake. When she realized that she was in the right place, she gave me the contempt stare. I washed my hands and took a good look at myself in the mirror. I tried to see what she saw. Short hair, rimless glasses. A pink Oxford button down shirt open at the neck (with a binder underneath), black jeans. A black belt with an oval pewter buckle, black leather chukkas. If I were a guy, I\u2019d look like I paid attention to what I was wearing. All I saw was a middle-aged butch. I don\u2019t know what she expected, but our office does not have a dress code. My version of business casual is very casual, and masculine. I do not wear anything to signify that I am female. There were none of the expected clues, the three or four things that make the difference between being read as male or as female (hair style, accessories, demeanor). She felt entitled to look me over. She expected me to apologize; I didn\u2019t. It was her problem. I was caught off-guard because that is my \u201csafe\u201d bathroom at work. It is the one closest to my cubicle. All the women who work on the floor know me. I\u2019ve never had a problem in there before. This woman was an outsider. I belonged there. When I\u2019m out with Donna I use her as my cover. I get on line right behind her. I still get stared at, but being with a woman gives me credibility. I\u2019ve never been challenged when I\u2019m with Donna. I have a handful of safe bathrooms that I use when I am alone. I try not to use unfamiliar ones when I am out. I look for branches of Starbuck\u2019s and my gym (New York Sports Club) because they have single stall (gender neutral) restrooms in most locations. It is insanely difficult to find a bathroom in New York even if you are gender normative, and when you do, there is usually (for women) a line. Lines give me the heebie-jeebies. I\u2019ve had my share of ugly incidents. The worst was in the Houston airport, when a woman screamed so loud that security came running in and asked me for ID. When I\u2019ve been told \u201cThis is the Ladies Room\u201d I\u2019ve replied gently, to put the challenger at ease. I\u2019ve reigned in my sarcasm and my anger. This last incident changed how I feel. I want to turn it around. I want to ask \u201cWhy did you say that?\u201d or tell them \u201cI belong here.\u201d Although I continue to look for gender neutral bathrooms, I think it is the wrong tactic. I don\u2019t believe in separate but equal. I don\u2019t want to wander around looking for the trans* equivalent of the Colored bathroom. I don\u2019t want to avoid the cisgendered one because I might make one of \u201cthem\u201d uncomfortable. What has to happen for that young professional to accept that I belong in \u201cher\u201d restroom? For her to believe that there is nothing wrong with a genderqueer, butch, or transgender woman using a woman\u2019s bathroom? I\u2019m tired of carving out safe spaces.\u00a0I\u2019m tired of being stared at or commented upon. I\u2019m over worrying whether my presence makes strangers uncomfortable. It is time for them to get over it too. ", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
