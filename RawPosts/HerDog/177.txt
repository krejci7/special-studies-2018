I find myself continuing old arguments with my mother. Arguments that I can not win. I hear her yelling \u201cWhat is wrong with you? Why can\u2019t you be normal? What did I do to deserve this?\u201d My mother and I argued from nursery school through graduate school. I couldn\u2019t take it. I gradually reduced the number of visits\u00a0 until I only saw her at funerals, weddings, and Bar/Bat MItzvahs. We could not be seated at the same table. In the end we had nothing to say to each other. We argued silently. My mother was always angry with me. She wanted a daughter. She wanted me to wear pretty dresses. She wanted me to be coy and precocious. She wanted me to prove that she was a good mother. Instead, I was an embarrassment. I was boyish, chubby, awkward, and shy. I was willfully disobedient. I threw tantrums. I was visible proof of her failure. She was an unhappy person. She was critical of everyone except for her mother and my brother. She felt slighted in every interaction with the outside world. She blamed it on me. I made her look bad. She could not accept I was at the boy\u2019s end of the girl\u2019s bell curve. She tried to force me towards the middle. I did not budge. She would argue \u201cHow can you go out looking like that? Who will be friends with you? Who will want to marry you? What college will accept you? Who will hire you? What is wrong with you?\u201d I could not defend myself against her.\u00a0 Answering gave her more fuel; silence allowed her to continue because she was right all along. Heinz Kohut called this narcissistic rage. It was my mother\u2019s modus operandi. There are\u00a0parents who do not silence their children or force them to hide their true selves. They love and\u00a0accept their\u00a0feminine sons, their masculine daughters, their transgender children. They take a lot of flak for practicing unconditional love. I follow two blogs written by the mothers of transgender children; George Jesse Love\u00a0and Trans*forming Family. They give me hope. When it was clear she was dying, my mother told my brother to let me know, in case I wanted to see her. I told him to tell her that if she asked to see me I would go. She did not ask. I did not go. Donna and I went to the funeral. My mother\u00a0was interred in the last\u00a0crypt of her father\u2019s family\u2019s mausoleum. She was placed directly under her mother. She would have been upset with the rabbi (too young), with the service (too short), and with me for wearing black Levi\u2019s (inappropriate). When I die I want my ashes to be mixed with the ashes of my dogs. I want our ashes scattered at Good Harbor Beach in Gloucester, Massachusetts. It will be my last act of willful disobedience.
