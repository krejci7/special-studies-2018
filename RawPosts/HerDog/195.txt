My mother wanted me to get the red ones. I pitched a fit. If you read that first paragraph carefully, you guessed that there were many fights. \u00a0Many of them over clothing. \u00a0Many of them over shoes. \u00a0Until I was in the middle of 5th grade, girls had to wear dresses to school, even pubic schools. \u00a0There was not much of a point in fighting about that. \u00a0It was \u201cThe Law\u201d. \u00a0I had an assortment of drab\u00a0dresses that I absolutely hated. \u00a0Not because they were drab. Drab for me was always fine, at least until recently. \u00a0Navy blue comes in many shades; I own clothing in all of them. \u00a0Butches appreciate the nuances of navy blue. \u00a0\u201cEverything goes with blue jeans\u201d is my motto, although I wouldn\u2019t have included pink shirts until recently. \u00a0 I learned to wear pink by wearing what I thought of as \u201cmen\u2019s pink\u201d. \u00a0I was at work and I saw a guy wearing a pink shirt and I thought \u201cIf he can do that then I can do that\u201d. \u00a0I went out and bought my first Brooks Brothers button down Oxford cloth shirt in pink. I have a thing about button down shirts. \u00a0I own about twenty of them. \u00a0Four of them are pink. Initially it was hard for me to accept that I looked good in pink. \u00a0I knew I looked good in maroon. \u00a0Maroon was cool. \u00a0Maroon could be a team color. \u00a0Pink was for girls, except when it was for guys and then I could wear it. \u00a0 Once I could accept that I was handsome in pink, it worked. Sometimes my own logic defies logic. ", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
