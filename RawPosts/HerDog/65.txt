I could not picture myself as an adult. What I might look like, who I would live with, or what I would do. I drew blanks. I knew what I didn\u2019t want to be. I didn\u2019t want to be a girl. I didn\u2019t want to be like my mother. I didn\u2019t want to marry a man and have kids. I didn\u2019t want to be a wife. I didn\u2019t want to be a career woman in a skirt suit. I didn\u2019t want to grow up. I didn\u2019t want to do the long list of things that my mother did to get ready. I didn\u2019t want to bother with pantyhose, lip stick, eye liner, foundation, perfume, hair spray, or nail polish. I didn\u2019t know there were other options. I survived by resisting my mother\u2019s attempts to make me look like or act like a girl. I survived, but I did not thrive. I thought in double-negatives. I didn\u2019t do what I didn\u2019t want to do. This is not the same as doing what you want to do. Whenever possible, I didn\u2019t do the girl stuff. I dragged my feet and resisted. Sometimes I didn\u2019t do anything at all. I stayed in my head or I read. All of my fantasies were about being a boy. I kept the cognitive dissonance to a minimum by not fantasizing about being either a man or a woman. I didn\u2019t want to grow up. I didn\u2019t want to be a blank. Getting comfortable in one\u2019s body is not always easy. I didn\u2019t make a lot of compromises. I didn\u2019t twist myself into a pretzel to make other people comfortable. I figured out what kinds of jobs and workplaces to avoid. I learned that if you are really good at what you do most people will cut you some slack for being eccentric. Others will not be able to get past what you look like, no matter how good you are. Some people don\u2019t like butches. I do not regret being a butch. I regret that I didn\u2019t let the trans out earlier. That I lived for so long in the land of \u201cI am not\u201d instead of in the land of \u201cI am\u201d. My life would have been different if had I been permitted to say what I wanted without fear of reprisal or punishment. I\u2019m no longer afraid, but I still have trouble imagining my future. I want to be free from dysphoria. I want to feel comfortable in my body and in the external world. I\u2019m not there yet. Changing my name and getting top surgery both brought me closer. The next sentences all start pulling back into the \u201cI don\u2019t want\u201d construction; it is a struggle to re-write them. To turn resistance into initiative. To turn \u201cI don\u2019t want to transition into a man.\u201d into \u201cI want to continue my transition at my own pace and in the same direction.\u201d Notes: I\u2019ve stalled out on thinking about testosterone due to the high cholesterol count (282) on my blood test. Right now all I can say is that I want to get my cholesterol down so I can have free choice. And that sometimes I hate being middle-aged and having middle-aged problems.
