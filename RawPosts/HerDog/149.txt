Donna and I had cooked Thanksgiving dinner for ten, and we had a couple of friends stay over with us. We ate a lot of food, and stayed up late talking. I wanted to recuperate and relax. I didn\u2019t make it. On Saturday, I set off for the Union Square Greenmarket to get some local apples and dark leafy greens. I got sidetracked by the big \u201c30% Off\u201d sign in the window of J. Crew. I bought two plaid shirts and a wool fair isle sweater before I got to the kale, collard greens, and broccoli rabe. It wasn\u2019t completely my fault. My e-mail was bombarded with 30% and 40% off coupons. I tried to ignore them, but some marketer understands my psychology. I succumbed to the hype. The sweater is great; the two shirts are nice but a little long on me (or I am a little short for them). I don\u2019t have buyer\u2019s remorse. I have two more shirts I don\u2019t need. On Monday, I struggled to not peek at the Timberland, Lucky Brand, American Eagle Outfitters, and Brooks Brothers websites. I didn\u2019t want to feel the shopping itch again. I didn\u2019t want to be a Cyber Monday sucker. I heard the coupons singing to me. This time I resisted. I unconsciously keep track of things I\u2019ve seen (e.g. the wool sweater), things I\u2019ve imagined will make me look good, clothes that will magically turn me from a butch frog into a handsome prince. It never works, but I keep believing that I will be transformed. I flip through the men\u2019s sections of catalogs wishing I looked like the models. I can not buy my way out of being who I am, but I keep trying. Pluto looking at himself in the Hall of Mirrors. From \u201cBone Trouble.\u201d What I see in my head never matches what I see in the mirror. When I look in the mirror I distort the image. It is like having two circus mirrors, one on the inside and one on the outside. I do not have a way to accurately see whom I look like. I don\u2019t have a clear picture of \u00a0my silhouette; I can\u2019t keep the crayon in-between the lines. My holiday shopping is only for me. Donna and I don\u2019t celebrate Christmas. The official reason is that I am Jewish and my parents believed that Jews observed Christmas by eating Chinese food. The unofficial reason is that my birthday is Christmas Eve. When I was little I resented that it was overshadowed by that other guy\u2019s birthday. I didn\u2019t want to celebrate either one. I have mixed feelings about my birthday.\u00a0I don\u2019t like being the center of attention. My birthday was tainted by my mother\u2019s disapproval of my boyishness, her desire for me to conform, and her inability or refusal to give me a present I might like. By the end of the day all I wanted to do was make a wish, blow out the candles, eat the cake, and go to bed. I still have trouble with presents. I am unable to ask for what I want. I don\u2019t believe that I will be taken seriously. I am afraid of being judged.\u00a0I ask for things that are safe, like books (this year\u2019s list includes Julia Serano\u2018s new book \u201cExcluded\u201d and Yotam Ottonlenghi\u2019s first cookbook \u201cPlenty\u201c). If I yearn for something material, I will buy it. The intangibles I keep to myself. Note: Here is a link to the Disney cartoon \u201cBone Trouble.\u201d It is eight minutes of pure fun, starring Pluto and Butch the Bulldog. The scenes with Pluto in the Carnival\u2019s Hall of Mirrors are fabulous. He handles mirrors much better than I do. ", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
