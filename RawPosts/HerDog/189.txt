When she wants to come up on the bed or couch, she grunts a little low \u201curg\u201d to get my attention, and waits for an invitation. When she wants her belly rubbed, she rolls over and taps her tail. When I have ignored chow time she lies down in my sight line and stares at me. When she is ready to go out she goes to the door. When she is bored she goes to her toy box and throws everything that is in it onto the floor. When there is an \u201curgency\u201d she noses me and dances around. There is no confusing or mistaking any of these signals. Gracie is confident. Gracie is a good girl. I find it difficult to ask for anything. I learned to suppress my desires. I learned to stop saying what I wanted because I wanted to be a boy. What game do you want to play? What do you want to dress up as for Halloween? What do you want to do when you grow up? Do you want to play house? What do you want for your birthday? The message was clear. If I told the truth, I got in trouble. If I lied, I betrayed myself and ended up with a Barbie Dreamhouse. Either way, I was not getting the hockey skates. \u00a0The safest thing was to say nothing, but you can\u2019t stay silent forever. I know, I tried, it doesn\u2019t work. Donna wonders why, after all of our time together, am I still so secretive? Why can\u2019t I just tell her what I am thinking? Why is it so difficult for me to talk about my feelings? Why can\u2019t I tell her what I want? Why do I hesitate? Why don\u2019t I trust her? I still feel like the eight year old who yearns for hockey skates but is afraid to ask for them. I hope that refusing to suppress my trans*-ness, my boy-ness, and my more than vanilla butch-ness, will eventually let me loosen my tongue. I would like to answer Donna\u2019s questions honestly, without fear, and without squirming in my seat. I would like to be as confident as Gracie. I would like to be a good boy.
