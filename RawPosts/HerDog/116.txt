It is a man\u2019s dress.\u201d If a dress is made for a man, or bought by a man, it becomes his. He owns it. The dress has no gender; the person wearing it does. There was a cold snap and I broke out my favorite flannel shirt. It is a classic L.L. Bean, a Black Watch Plaid, in a women\u2019s large. It used to look really good on me, before I lost weight. Now it is super baggy. I can still wear it, but I\u2019m hesitant.\u00a0It buttons to the left (the girl\u2019s side). I\u2019m struggling with this. My weight is down from 175 lbs. to 140 lbs., but my height is still five foot four. My eyes have not adjusted. I can only see how much weight I\u2019ve lost when I try to wear my old clothes. I\u2019ve downsized my jeans several times and replaced a few worn out T-shirts. My button-down shirts are between two and five years old. They are between big and too big. I stopped buying dress shirts because I knew I was going to stop working. Then I went on a self-imposed flannel hiatus because I have slew of old flannel shirts. It didn\u2019t last. Then I decided to completely stop shopping for shirts because I want to wait until after I have top surgery. If I need to shop, I will stick to sneakers and hiking shoes. It is almost impossible for me to buy a women\u2019s shirt off the rack. I\u2019m petite (I hate that word) and I won\u2019t touch anything that has darts, princess seams, funny collars, or odd plackets. I\u2019ll wear clothing made for women that looks like it is made for men. There isn\u2019t much out there. It is also almost impossible for me to buy a men\u2019s shirt off the rack. I like the styles, but the sleeves end below my fingertips, the body is too long, and if the chest fits it doesn\u2019t close over the hips (and if the hips fit it is too big everywhere else). I have a half-dozen fabulous custom-made dress shirts from CEGO\u00a0shirtmakers. They were perfect when I weighed 165 lbs. The neck fits, the sleeves are the right length, the body is the right length, they fit over my hips, and they button to the right. They are too big, and I don\u2019t wear them anymore. I think of them as men\u2019s shirts, but since they were custom-made for me, maybe I should think of them as butch/transgender shirts. I may be an idiot, but I can\u2019t stand to think of them as women\u2019s shirts. I also have a half-dozen custom (women\u2019s) classic Oxford cloth shirts that I bought at Brooks Brothers when I was 155 lbs. They still look good, even though they are a little baggy. Except that they button the wrong way. It is my quandary, to wear them or to give them away. Donna claims no one else notices which side my shirts button on. And, she reminds me, no matter which shirt I am wearing, I read as masculine, not male. Some guys are oblivious to fashion and some pay attention to what other guys are wearing. They\u2019ll snicker if they see a guy wearing a brown belt with black shoes, or wearing blue socks with a black suit. I don\u2019t want to be one of those guys. GSElevator writes about\u00a0this in How To Dress The Part On Wall Street. He\u2019d notice the buttons. Do I care about him? Am I so shallow that seven buttons have me in a swivet? Women may wear men\u2019s clothes, but men do not wear women\u2019s. There are boyfriend cardigans and boyfriend jeans for women, but no girlfriend jeans for men. It turns out that this is not entirely true. Levi\u2019s marketed an \u201cex-girlfriend jean\u201d for men. A tight punk rocker cut. Most guys don\u2019t borrow their ex-girlfriend\u2019s clothes (and why the ex, instead of just girlfriend?). For the record, over the years, Donna has purloined several of my T\u2019s and flannel shirts. I have never, ever, ever, worn a piece of her clothing. I have a fantasy that men\u2019s shirts will fit better after I have top surgery. Logically, I know that the discrepancy between my chest and my hips will still make it difficult for me to buy a shirt. If I want a shirt that buttons to the right and fits, I will have to go back to CEGO. A survey of my closet turned up over twenty flannel shirts. Only two (both L.L. Bean mediums purchased last year during the hiatus) fit properly, and they both button on the left. I will need to look back at David Bowie and think of them as butch/transgender shirts. Because that is who I am. Note: After an extensive investigation it was discovered that GSELEVATOR never worked at Goldman Sachs. The New York Times expose of the Tweeter is here.
