I just was the way I was. This flustered adults who (mis)gendered me as a boy. As if I was trying to pull something over on them. As if I was being dishonest. As if it was a game that went to far. It embarrassed the adults;\u00a0they didn\u2019t like being fooled. Being seen as a boy is different from pretending I was\u00a0a boy. I\u00a0continued seeing myself as a boy long after I should have gotten the picture that being a girl is permanent. I refused to inhabit the pink world, the Barbie and ballet class world. I refused to think of myself as a girl. Other people call this denial, but I see it as a form of self-determination. I tried as much as possible to stay in the range of activities where I could see myself as a boy. This required a fair amount of magical thinking, e.g. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a three-quarter length sleeve shirt \u2013 it\u2019s a football jersey and I\u2019m a quarterback.\u201d I dissociated from my body. By staying inside myself I avoided having to face the world as a girl. I would rather do nothing than do something girlish. I played by myself a lot. The stereotype of butch lesbians\u00a0is that we are pretending to look like or act like men. Some butches (and some trans guys and some cis guys) may lay it on a little heavy for some people\u2019s taste; we may project a type of masculinity that some find offensive or unattractive.\u00a0After a life time of being told to tone it down and not be so blatant, it is not easy to trust my instincts or to get it right.\u00a0 If I ever pretended to be anything, I pretended to be a girl who wants to be a boy. I never tried\u00a0to be a girly girl. It reassured the adults if\u00a0I said I was a girl even if I didn\u2019t act like one. I learned to throw a few girl\u2019s toy\u2019s around me while I played with boy\u2019s toys. I learned to take out a couple of girl\u2019s books for show at the library when I took out the boy\u2019s books that I wanted to read. I learned to create the illusion that I was doing both girl and boy. When Craig Russell dresses up and performs as Mae West; he is doing drag. When Mae West dresses up and performs as an actor playing Mae West she is doing double drag. If this sounds convoluted, trust me, it is. But, double drag is more common than you would think. Here is a video of Craig Russell singing Frankie and Johnny (1979), and here is Mae West singing the same tune (1976). I was eight years old when I first tried to wrap my head around this concept. I knew being a girl was a charade, but I couldn\u2019t find a way out of it. It was impractical to insist that I was a boy, but I continued to hope that eventually everyone would get it. It was equally impractical to pretend I was a girl; I was incapable of acting like the other girls. Claiming I was a tomboy gave me an excuse for being unable to assimilate as either a boy or a girl.\u00a0I learned how to do double drag as a way of being myself in public. Boy-girl-boy. Notes: I first read about double drag in this (long and academic) essay by Wendy Doniger \u2013 \u201cThe Mythology of Self-Imitation in Passing: Race, Gender, and Politics\u201c. If her name sounds familiar, it is because her book \u201cThe Hindus: An Alternative History\u201d created a controversy and was withdrawn from publication in India because of objections from Hindu ultra-conservatives. It is still available in print outside of India. Frieda Belinfante\u00a0(photo) was a lesbian, a cellist, an orchestra conductor, and a fighter in the Dutch resistance movement during WWII. When\u00a0the Nazis were hunting for her she avoided being captured by passing as a man. She emigrated to the US after the war. ", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
