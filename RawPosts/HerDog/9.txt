Why do you have to let everyone know that you are gay? Why can\u2019t you keep your sexual life private like everyone else does?\u201d Her next line of defense was to ask \u201cWhy can\u2019t you at least dress nicely when you visit or when we go out in public together?\u201d The subtext was that I should try to look normal so that no one (i.e. my grandmother or the neighbors) would know and so that my mother could pretend that everything was fine. My mother knew that everything had gone wrong. It was only possible to deny reality. To hide the truth. To keep other people from seeing what she saw. To control what was visible. My mother believed that gay people should stay in the closet. She tried to get me to look like the daughter she wanted. I couldn\u2019t do it. I was born blatant. I will die blatant. My mother asked me to tone it down. I don\u2019t think she ever understood that it wasn\u2019t just a style. That I was never going to look like a presentable middle-of-the-road lesbian. I don\u2019t think she worried about my safety as a young butch. She didn\u2019t think about street harassment, police harassment, or gay bashing. I\u2019m lucky I\u2019ve never been physically attacked, but I\u2019ve been bullied and called every anti-gay slur in the book. Mostly, I get stared at. Sometimes I overhear people say things, but not directly to me. When it happens, I don\u2019t feel that I\u2019m in danger. A couple of years ago, some guy leaned out of his car at a red light and called me a \u201cfucking faggot\u201d. I yelled back \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking idiot, I\u2019m a fucking dyke not a fucking faggot.\u201d I walked home, in the opposite direction, keeping an eye out for him, in case he turned around to follow me. I\u2019m half expecting something like that to happen again. Bigots have always been out there, and they\u2019ve been emboldened by the presidential election. I\u2019m wary of unfriendly looking strangers. I feel visible, and vulnerable. Not vulnerable enough to change what I\u2019m doing. If someone is uncomfortable around gay people, masculine women, people of indeterminate gender, or transmasculine folk, they will be uncomfortable around me. When I have an awkward interaction with a stranger I wonder if it because they don\u2019t like how I look. I fought with my mother, day in day out, from the age of three until I left home for college. I couldn\u2019t stand to dress or act like a girl, and she couldn\u2019t stand my refusal to obey. I thought those days were over. My mother has been dead for almost 5 years; I rarely saw her for the last twenty-five years of her life. Last week she showed up in a dream. I heard her asking me \u201cWhat do you think you are doing, why can\u2019t you be like everybody else, why can\u2019t you be normal?\u201d She\u2019s been emboldened by the election too. Fortunately, when I woke up, I remembered that she was still dead and I was still alive. Notes: My mother was a life-long Republican. She voted for every Republican presidential candidate with only one exception: she didn\u2019t vote for Nixon in 1972 because she didn\u2019t want my brother to get drafted into the Vietnam War. Nixon won anyway. I don\u2019t know if she would have made another exception for Trump. Last week I heard Damon Young read an essay called \u201cNigga Neurosis\u201d on WNYC (Public Radio). It is about second guessing every interaction, and while it is about race, it is easily extrapolated to gender identity. ", "feedtitle": "A Boy and Her Dog"}
