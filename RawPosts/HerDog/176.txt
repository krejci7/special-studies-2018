People notice me. They \u201cSir\u201d me by accident or condescendingly \u201cMa\u2019am\u201d me. It is a binary world and I am not a person who fits comfortably on either side of the male/female divide. There are times when I am tired of being a masculine woman; when I would like to be either a\u00a0cisgendered\u00a0man or a\u00a0cisgendered\u00a0woman. To blend in and move around anonymously. To get dressed for a party without having a major dysphoria attack. There are times I would like to live in a magical world where my existence as butch or trans* does not cause a problem. For me or for anyone else. Butches (and all\u00a0other gender non-conforming people) disrupt the natural flow of events. We make people uncomfortable. There are a million nuances in how men conduct themselves with\u00a0women. And in how\u00a0men conduct themselves with\u00a0other men. The same holds true for women.\u00a0Every interaction is gendered. There is no etiquette\u00a0for whether a butch should be treated like a woman or a like a man.\u00a0 It shouldn\u2019t matter, everyone should be treated with consideration and respect, but it doesn\u2019t work that way. Being butch upsets the status quo. It makes life complicated in elevators and bars. Am I expected to exit with the women (before the men) or am I expected to buy a round of beers like a guy?\u00a0When I do what comes naturally I\u00a0commit gender faux pas. I err on the masculine side. I allow myself a to be a little chivalrous with Donna. She likes it. My manners are lifted from my brother\u2019s Boy Scout manual. When I was eight,\u00a0I read it over and over, cover to cover. My manners are mis-matched with my sex. The more adult and the more formal the situation the more I experience myself\u00a0as ridiculous and absurd. I feel out-of-place\u00a0and inappropriate. The\u00a0fancier\u00a0the occasion\u00a0the greater the divide between what men wear and what women wear and how\u00a0each sex\u00a0expresses itself. Both camps seem like grown-up drag. I don\u2019t know where I belong.\u00a0 There is no middle ground. I end up avoiding any work or social function where I can\u2019t go casual. If I can\u2019t go in good jeans, a nice button-down shirt, and loafers, then I am in trouble. It isn\u2019t just about the clothing; it is about comportment. That is mis-matched too. I\u2019ve struggled with several bosses to keep from having to dress up for work; every time I get a new one I give him the WYSIWYG\u00a0talk. I overcompensate for this by being reliable and hard-working, being the most knowledgeable person in my department, and making myself\u00a0indispensable to the overall operation. I am recognized as eccentric and as someone you call on as soon as there is an emergency. I\u2019ve been advised to get a custom-made suit, to pretend that I am Ellen DeGeneres when I go shopping, and to look through men\u2019s magazines to pick out a style that I think I could wear. But I still can\u2019t picture myself in a fancy restaurant or the executive office. My imagination does not stretch that far. It goes as far as the dog run. Where my etiquette is perfect.
