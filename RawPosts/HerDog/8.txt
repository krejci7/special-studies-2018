This sentence does not come out of my mouth easily. I get flustered when I\u2019m asked which pronouns I use. I don\u2019t like being referred to as she/her. I never have and I never will. In the past two years I\u2019ve made some half-assed attempts to request they/them pronouns, but then I backed off. I never interrupted the conversation to tell someone they made a mistake. This week I have to get over it. Superman had a mental block against Kryptonite. I\u2019ve got a mental block against changing my pronouns. They/them still sounds forced and artificial to me, but it goes with Jamie. Both are neutral, both simultaneously raise and answer questions. Both are chosen by me, not given to me at birth. Maybe I forgot how hard it was to change my name, but shifting pronouns seems harder. I regularly attend a transmasculine support group at The Center. Each meeting starts with a go round of names and PGPs (preferred gender pronouns). The assumption is that everyone knows what they want to go by. Most use he/him, some use they/them, and no one admits they use she/her. Augie says \u201cMy name is Augie and my pronouns are Augie.\u201d I\u2019m stuck in a rut saying that I\u2019m Jamie and I am pronoun challenged. I don\u2019t want to go through the rest of my life cringing at my pronouns or saying that it doesn\u2019t matter when it actually does. It is increasingly disempowering for me to say I\u2019m trans and then be referred to as \u201cshe\u201d. This week I have an opportunity to introduce myself to a new group, and to reclaim they/them pronouns. Alexis and I will be giving a short presentation on organizing actions to the \u201cbig LGBT group with no name yet\u201d that just formed in NYC to resist Trump. I\u2019m going to try to make it clear at the meeting that I use they/them pronouns, and I\u2019m going to try to stick with it, at least in LGBT circles. I know a few people who actively use they/them pronouns in all aspects of their lives. All them are under 40. All of them complain about the difficulty of getting friends, co-workers, and family to use they/them consistently. I don\u2019t know anyone over 50 who uses they/them. I feel faintly ridiculous doing this, but not ridiculous enough to keep putting it off. I\u2019m not looking forward to discussing grammar, special snowflakes, or whether non-binary identities are for real. I\u2019m not looking forward to discussing whether it is cisgender privilege to use they/them instead of he/him. I am embarrassed that one of the impetuses for changing my pronouns is that I invited the guys from my transmasculine support group to the \u201cbig LGBT group with no name yet\u201d. I\u2019m expecting a few of them to show up. I invited them because I don\u2019t want the new group to be the usual mix of lots of gay men and a handful of lesbians. I don\u2019t want the T in LGBT to be silent. I also don\u2019t want to be misgendered in front of my trans friends. At the intersection of my queer political circle and my transmasculine circle I want to be a third person singular they. The start of the Trump/Pence apocalypse is an odd time to choose for splitting hairs over pronouns, but I\u2019m not going to spend the next four years fighting for our lives while being referred to as \u201cshe\u201d or while downplaying my gender identity. If I\u2019m in it for the long haul, I\u2019m in it as me. Notes: I wish I was as eloquent and as forceful as Jack Monroe is in this post from their blog \u201cCooking On A Bootstrap\u201c. In it Jack comes out as non-binary and challenges everyone to use the third person singular they when writing about them. There are still naysayers who state that \u201cthey\u201d is ungrammatical. For the grammarians out there, this is my favorite Trump grammar meme:  ", "feedtitle": "A Boy and Her Dog"}
