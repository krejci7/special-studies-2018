I definitely don\u2019t have it the way some people report it.  For example, here\u2019s a famous description from Lydia K.: So you run your internal gender_check and get nothing as a response: you@body# gender_check you@body# Return code is zero, nothing is printed out, everything is all good, and you think \u201cI have no idea what these people are talking about, there isn\u2019t anything here.\u201d. When a trans person runs their gender_check they get a slew of errors, a spewage of various issues that need to be addressed No, my nervous system doesn\u2019t randomly run a \u201cgender check\u201d and come back with an error.  By and large, I\u2019m satisfied with my genitals.  It can be a pain (literally!) to tuck them out of sight when I\u2019m presenting as a woman, but they fit my usual male presentation.  I think they\u2019re pretty nice looking, and fun to play with, and chicks dig \u2019em (okay, my wife digs \u2019em).  If I woke up without them one day I\u2019d make do, but otherwise they\u2019re not going anywhere and I\u2019m fine with that too. I do actually feel dissatisfied with my body.  Primarily it\u2019s a weight issue, because for most of my life so far I was on the slim side.  Then in my late twenties I got the \u201cmiddle-aged spread.\u201d  I felt fine through all the childhood growth changes and a full male puberty, but it was the weight that felt foreign.  Ever since I was about 27 I\u2019ve looked in the mirror and thought, \u201cthat\u2019s not me, that doesn\u2019t belong there.\u201d  I\u2019ve lost a little weight over the past few years, but a lot of it has come off my legs.  I look great from the waist down, but sometimes my shoulder-to-hip ratio really jumps out at me in the mirror and in pictures, and I feel frustrated and discouraged. The part that bothers me most is my belly.  My shoulders and ribcage have also grown since then, which is perfectly normal for adult men, but I miss the time when my shoulders weren\u2019t much broader than those of the average woman my height.  And yes, I know that there are XX, women-raised-women with my shape, but most of them don\u2019t have deep voices and big hands and thick facial hair to deal with too. So yes, sometimes I do feel uncomfortable having broad shoulders and a penis, but only when I\u2019m actively thinking about presenting as a woman.  Otherwise I have the same body dysphoria that a lot of formerly thin people have. Does that mean I\u2019m not trans?  Far from it.  I still periodically feel a desire to be a woman, and sometimes I feel sad when I\u2019m not seen as a woman.  There are lots of trans people like me who don\u2019t have heavy body dysphoria, and many of us have quite satisfactory transitions. So in addition to the feelings I have, which I described in this post, we can add that some people have this \u201cgender check\u201d type of body dysphoria.  Just not all of us. You\u2019ll notice that in my last post I used \u201cI statements,\u201d talking about the feelings that I personally feel or have felt.  I don\u2019t claim to know what \u201ca trans person\u201d feels, unless that trans person is me.  Lydia K. doesn\u2019t know what \u201ca trans person\u201d feels either unless that trans person is her, and I wish she\u2019d stop pretending she does.", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
