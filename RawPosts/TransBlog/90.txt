Personally, I practice skepticism.  In general I try to minimize the number of things in the world I take on faith.  I find it comforting, particularly in understanding transgender feelings and actions.  But in talking about trans phenomena, my skepticism conflicts with the way a lot of other people talk about those things.  The key difference is in talking about transgender beliefs, specifically the concept of gender identity.  But you don\u2019t have to espouse trans beliefs to understand trans feelings or to argue for fairness and respect. The typical story is that \u201ctrans women are women\u201d and \u201ctrans men are men,\u201d supported by a number of dubious and hotly contested brain studies.  On this basis, everyone is asserted to have a \u201cgender identity,\u201d an \u201cinnate sense of their own gender,\u201d and that is taken as the person\u2019s \u201cauthentic,\u201d essential gender.  Often this is invoked to argue that it is the person\u2019s destiny to transition.  Genderqueer, genderfluid and other non-binary people are declared to be a mixture of brain genders on the basis of simple analogy, and the implication is that their only true path is to express gender in the corresponding proportions. The critical thing here is that very few trans or genderqueer people have actually undergone a brain scan.  Most of the studies that people typically cite were actually performed on the cadavers of trans women.  Of course, trans people typically want to stay alive; many even frame it as transition or die. The official basis for determining gender identity is thus a simple declaration: \u201cI\u2019m really a woman.\u201d  You can see why a skeptical approach would have trouble with all of this.  If the primary basis for determining gender identity is a belief that we are \u201creally\u201d a different gender from what most people think, and I try not to believe anything without sufficient evidence, how can I as have any gender identity and still maintain my skepticism? But wait, there\u2019s more!  The typical story is that gender identity is innate and unchanging, but anyone who has spent time around non-transitioners, non-binary people and people near the edge of the \u201ctransgender umbrella\u201d like cross-dressers, drag queens, and people exploring gender, has seen things that give the lie to this idea.  I\u2019ve seen all manner of people who one day explain that they\u2019re \u201cjust\u201d men who feel a little feminine, and the next swear up and down that they\u2019ve always felt like women. In individual practice, one person\u2019s determination of another\u2019s gender identity is even more subjective than that.  Typically, a simple claim of belief is not accepted without at least a declaration of intent to transition, but some people will overrule that based on their impressions of the other\u2019s masculinity.  Often, a person will accept another as trans (and thus as their desired gender) based on a declaration, but then question that gender if they do not demonstrate satisfactory progress in transitioning.  Frequently, a trans or genderqueer person will make no profession of belief, but another person will make claims about that person\u2019s gender identity based on evidence of transition, passability or impressions of femininity. From a skeptical perspective, this evidence is unsatisfactory on three levels.  First, we\u2019re expected to accept gender identity on the basis of professed belief, which is inherently untrustworthy.  Second, we\u2019re asked to accept these beliefs as evidence of an innate, eternal state, even when they have changed.  Third, we\u2019re asked to accept beliefs, reported second or thirdhand, that are sometimes invented or assumed by the people reporting them. Sorry, I can\u2019t do it.  I\u2019m not going to spend years of my life resisting a belief in Satan or Pachamama, and then turn around and accept the Authentic Self without question.  I don\u2019t even really believe I have a pancreas, let alone an \u201cinteriority.\u201d  I accept that I probably do have a pancreas because the biologists seem to be right about fingers and sinuses and stuff, but claims of interior womanhood are a lot less reliable.  So I don\u2019t claim a gender identity for myself or anyone else. The challenge is that I also want to be respectful and to fight for fair treatment for myself and other trans people.  I can do that, because I don\u2019t need to believe people\u2019s beliefs to believe and honor their feelings, to treat people fairly and with respect.  I just need to believe in their essential humanity.  It works for me with Mormons and Buddhists, and it works with people who believe in gender identity.  I wish more people would try it!", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
