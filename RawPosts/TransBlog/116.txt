A few months later I asked a gay black man about trans self-identification in black communities, and he pointed me to Roberts. I was, honestly, more convinced by the assertion (I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not) that RuPaul rejects the term \u201ctransgender\u201d for himself.  Whether or not he counts as trans, I think Roberts made a strong case that he is not a prototypical black trans person, or an appropriate community spokesperson.  It seems like she wasn\u2019t content with that, and insisted on excluding RuPaul completely from the category of trans.  She has now taken it upon herself to do the same for another person who is not even claiming to speak for trans people, B. Scott.  I first heard of Scott last night when someone reposted a blog post of his on Tumblr; apparently he\u2019s an entertainment journalist who does news, commentary and interviews on his blog, as well as a YouTube channel and podcast, but has branched out into more established media. Scott identifies as a \u201cproud gay man,\u201d but his public persona is so high-glam femme that he is often perceived as a beautiful woman.  At least one man felt embarrassed after trying to flirt with Scott, and lashed out in an immature way. The current controversy started in June when Scott had been invited to appear at the 2013 BET Awards Pre-Show.  He claims that at the last minute, after extensive wardrobe negotiations (people do this?) and interviewing one guest on camera, the BET staffers told him his outfit \u201cwasn\u2019t acceptable,\u201d ordered him to change, and then told him he was being replaced for the rest of the pre-show. Scott is now suing the network for \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation.\u201d  In yesterday\u2019s blog post, he wrote, Over the years my love muffins and strangers alike have questioned me about my gender identity. What IS B. Scott? As a society we\u2019ve been conditioned to believe that a person has to be \u2018exactly\u2019 this or \u2018exactly\u2019 that. Biologically, I am male \u2014 as my sex was determined at birth by my reproductive organs. However, my spirit truly lies somewhere in between. It is that same spirit that has allowed me to become so comfortable in my skin, choose how I express myself, and contributes to how I live my day-to-day life. Transgender is the state of one\u2019s gender identity (self-identification as woman, man, neither or both) not matching one\u2019s assigned sex (identification by others as male, female or intersex based on physical/genetic sex). [source] It is by that definition that I accept and welcome the \u2018transgender\u2019 label with open arms. Makes sense, right? Scott self-identifies as \u201csomewhere in between,\u201d which counts as \u201cneither or both,\u201d and doesn\u2019t match his assigned male sex.  But that\u2019s not enough for Monica Roberts:  When B Scott starts taking hormones,  calling himself Brittany(or another femme name starting with 'B')& declares he's transitioning (con't) \u2014 Monica Roberts (@TransGriot) August 7, 2013   then I'll consider him part of Team Trans. \u2014 Monica Roberts (@TransGriot) August 7, 2013   Conflating being #trans with being androgynous like B Scott is NOT the same \u2014 Monica Roberts (@TransGriot) August 7, 2013  Roberts\u2019 reaction is really problematic.  What bothers me the most is that she is prescribing and delineating appropriate transgender actions.  It\u2019s not enough for Scott to appear in heavy makeup, long hair and women\u2019s clothes and shoes every time he is in front of a camera.  He has to take hormones, declare a transition, and adopt a name that Roberts approves as feminine enough.  As I wrote back in April, there are at least three conflicting definitions of transgender.  Roberts is saying that in order for her to consider him trans, Scott has to follow her prescriptions. Another thing that bothers me is that Roberts is not only claiming the right to define transgender, but the right to define the umbrella.  The \u201cumbrella\u201d definition of transgender is an inclusive one that brings in drag queens and anyone else who\u2019s remotely gender-variant.  As umbrella proponent Jamison Green famously said, \u201cThere is NOT one way to be trans.\u201d  Many prescriptive trans advocates explicitly reject the umbrella, many (like GLAAD) switch between the umbrella and their prescriptions, but Roberts claims that the umbrella is her prescriptions. In a subsequent blog post, Roberts clarified that she worried that this identification was purely a legal strategy, and that Scott was only \u201cembracing the transgender umbrella after resisting it for years.\u201d \u201cUntil I get and see more evidence that B.Scott\u2019s embrace of the transgender umbrella is genuine, permanent and not just related to this legal case, call me skeptical.\u201d Roberts knows a lot more about American black culture\u2019s attitudes towards transness than I do, but I would be surprised if a gay black man who grooms himself like a woman and is often perceived as a woman would face very much less discrimination and harassment than a transitioning black trans woman.  How often is Scott really able to draw on his male privilege? Based on her reactions to RuPaul, my guess is that Roberts is worried that with his large following, Scott could emerge as a powerful trans leader and spokesperson without transitioning, eclipsing her own influence and those of other transitioned black trans people like Janet Mock* and Laverne Cox.  Personally, I would welcome an influential non-transitioning trans person of any race to the cause.  Any creative responses to trans feelings would be a relief from the relentless hormones-surgery-name-change drumbeat put out by Roberts, Mock and other trans spokespeople.  And the transition buy-in that Roberts values so much doesn\u2019t stop her from being divisive and exclusionary. But regardless of whether you trust Scott to be true to the trans community, Roberts\u2019 heavy-handed prescriptivism should alarm not just advocates of transgender inclusivity, but also feminists of all stripes.  And her claiming the right to not just define transgender but to take the transgender umbrella away from us is just uncalled for. (*Update: In this sympathetic interview, Janet Mock makes it clear that she\u2019s not into that kind of boundary policing.)", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
