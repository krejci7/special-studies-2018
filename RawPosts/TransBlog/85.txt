There\u2019s really no mystery here, though: in some ways we\u2019re similar and in other ways we\u2019re different.  It\u2019s like cats and dogs: they\u2019re similar in lots of ways, and different in others. In future posts I\u2019ll talk a bit about ways that we\u2019re different, but tonight I want to focus on what we have in common: feelings.  In particular, the desire to be \u201cthe other\u201d gender and unhappiness with \u201cthe current\u201d gender.  I\u2019ve found that these two feelings are present to some degree in every trans person I\u2019ve met, whether transsexual, transvestite, cross-dresser, drag queen, two spirit, queen, genderqueer, genderfluid, non binary or anything else under the umbrella. There have been some arguments lately about whether you have to be dysphoric to be \u201creally trans.\u201d  Some have claimed that if you don\u2019t hate every minute of your life as your assigned gender, you\u2019re not part of the club.  Some have argued that you need \u201cbody dysphoria\u201d \u2013 a hatred of everything that feels like the gender you were assigned.  My body dysphoria is relatively mild and mostly involves my weight, but gender dysphoria in general captures a lot of what I feel like I have in common with transitioners and other trans people. The desire to be the other gender is not the same as dysphoria, but it is connected to dysphoria.  Some people feel dysphoria but not desire, others feel desire but not dysphoria, and many feel both.  There are other feelings as well, particularly gender fog, that seem pretty common; I invite you to look at my list of feelings and see which ones you feel, which ones you don\u2019t feel, and which feelings you feel that I didn\u2019t list. It\u2019s important to point out that these feelings are never constant.  No feelings are.  I\u2019ve seen a lot of people post on Reddit and Tumblr that their dysphoria or desire seems to have recently increased, or diminished, or even disappeared entirely.  That\u2019s normal. These feelings can also be connected to thoughts about the short term or the long term.  Some people want to be a man for the rest of their lives, and some people want to stop being a man for the rest of their lives.  Some people just want to be a woman for a day or an evening, and some people just want to stop being a woman for a year, or an hour, or long enough to get past those guys on the corner. I said that every trans person I met has expressed one of these two feelings, but I don\u2019t want to go from there to making universal claims about who\u2019s trans and who isn\u2019t.  I\u2019m open to the possibility that there are people who don\u2019t feel these feelings, but are still trans in some meaningful way. I also want to point out that a lot of so-called \u201ccis\u201d people have had these feelings at some point.  In general, I have the impression that most people who would call themselves \u201ctrans\u201d have the feelings more often, and more intensely, than others.  But I regularly hear about people who have fairly intense dysphoria or desire who say that they\u2019re not trans. As Jamison Green said, \u201cthere is NOT one way to be transgender,\u201d and there is not one set of actions to take in response to these feelings.  In recent posts I\u2019ve talked about transgender feelings and beliefs, and I\u2019ll talk about transgender actions in future posts. These feelings aren\u2019t the only thing that trans people have in common, but they\u2019re a major source of the things we have in common.  We do have things that separate us, and I\u2019ll talk about those in future posts as well.", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
