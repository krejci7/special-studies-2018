But that\u2019s not all of it: my masculine gender expression (of the two, the one that\u2019s best developed) is not very binary, and never has been.  But I don\u2019t feel like that part is exceptionally non binary.  Everyone\u2019s actions are non binary to one degree or another.  I\u2019ve just been more comfortable with my non binary actions than a lot of other people. The reasons we draw lines between men and women are to decide who gets access to what roles and spaces, what we expect from people, and how we\u2019re going to treat them.  But no matter where we draw the line between men and women, most people are not going to fit perfectly on one side or the other.  I\u2019ve met a lot of people over the years, and when you get to know them, everyone is pretty non-binary. Do I look non-binary to you? As I write this I\u2019m wearing all \u201cmen\u2019s\u201d clothes and accessories, bought in the Men\u2019s department.  I have my fingernails cut short, and I shaved my facial hair using a men\u2019s razor.  I\u2019m not wearing makeup.  I\u2019m going to my job as a university professor.  Tomorrow I will go to my research position in computer science, a continuation of my many years working in information technology.  All roles and spaces that have traditionally been \u201cmen\u2019s\u201d in middle-class white American society. I\u2019m doing a lot of things that are unmarked for gender.  I\u2019m drinking a latte and riding the subway.  I\u2019m writing on a tablet.  I\u2019m carrying a backpack.  I get together with friends.  I go to political meetings.  I post on Facebook and Twitter and Tumblr and my blogs. In my life as a \u201cguy,\u201d I do some things that have traditionally been \u201cwomen\u2019s work.\u201d  Tonight I\u2019m going to meet with my kid\u2019s teachers.  Sometimes my wife goes on business trips and I\u2019m taking care of the kid by myself for days on end.  When he was a baby I fed him and changed his diapers.  I buy almost all of my own clothes.  Yesterday I did laundry, for the entire family.  On Friday I\u2019ll cook dinner, and probably buy groceries.  Tomorrow I might clean the bathroom and go to Weight Watchers.  I\u2019ll eat salad.  When I was younger I worked as a secretary and ate Special K cereal.  I\u2019ve studied yoga and dance.  All traditionally women\u2019s roles. Of course, I\u2019ve known women who wear no makeup, who wear \u201cmen\u2019s\u201d clothes, who trim their fingernails and even shave their faces.  I have always had plenty of colleagues who were women, in university teaching, in computer science, and in information technology.  There are lots of women in university teaching, but in other parts of the country it\u2019s still unusual for a woman to be paid to open up a computer. I know other guys who take care of their kids, including the feeding and diapers.  I was told once that a particular temp agency in another city would not send men on secretarial assignments, but here in New York I met a number of other male secretaries.  When I\u2019ve traveled, most of the Weight Watchers meetings I\u2019ve been to have been dominated by women, but here I see men at practically every meeting.  Most of the guys I know buy their own clothes, and a lot of them wash the family\u2019s clothes and clean the bathroom and cook dinner.  Whenever I studied yoga or dance, there were other guys there.  I see guys at Just Salad, and maybe even eating Special K.  This means a lot of people crossing traditional gender boundaries. I do know some people who are pretty damn conventional about gender roles.  Women who never wear pants outside the house, men who won\u2019t touch a stove.  People who repeat things that sound like they\u2019re straight out of some Victorian etiquette guide.  But when I\u2019ve gotten to know these people, there\u2019s always something surprising about them.  A woman who started her own business.  A man who raised his kids without a woman in the house.  Every single one.  I\u2019ve never met someone who fit completely within standard gender norms. Now here\u2019s a problem: essentialist stances on gender rely on binary policing.  Whether you say, \u201call males are men\u201d or \u201ctrans women are women,\u201d you\u2019re saying that it matters who\u2019s a man and who\u2019s a woman.  Not that it matters for some practical sense, like bathroom access, but that beyond all practicality, it matters to you.  Otherwise you\u2019d just say that everyone should be allowed to use the bathroom they choose. This is a problem because of all the non binary actions I described, all the people who don\u2019t necessarily identify as \u201cnon binary\u201d or transgender, but do things that cross gender boundaries.  No matter where you place the boundaries, some people will cross it, and some will be straddling it. Any essentialist approach to gender based on birth assignment will necessarily leave a lot of people unsatisfied.  An essentialist, binary approach based on socialization will still erase a lot of people by ignoring the messy gray areas of socialization.  An essentialist approach based on professed belief or the observer\u2019s gut feeling (which are the only evidence ever accepted for \u201cgender identity\u201d) ignores and erases my reality, and really, everyone else\u2019s, even if they profess a gender identity, because everyone crosses gender boundaries. So here are my questions to everyone who believes that there are essential differences between men and women, whether by birth assignment, socialization, professed belief, or your personal judgment: When you divide the world of people into men and women, which roles, spaces and treatments are reserved for one gender or the other, and which are open to all?  Does your definition allow my reality?  Who would violate your categories?  What are the consequences?", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
