It\u2019s possible to go overboard with that, and normally she recognizes it. Last September she wrote, \u201cAs for \u2018transvestite\u2019, some have made it know they find this word offensive, too, however, I\u2019m also aware that it\u2019s usage as an umbrella term is rather widespread \u2014 particularly in the United Kingdom. I\u2019d be curious to hear what trans people from the other side of the pond feel about the term.\u201d Last week in a post about Rosalinda Rebolledo, she asked whether Rebolledo\u2019s story counted as \u201ctransgender news.\u201d  In a post today, O\u2019Donnell goes overboard.  The actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who\u2019s actually less silly than a lot of Hollywood people, was asked by USA Today, \u201cBut seriously, how can she look so fresh the day after partying until near-sunrise for the Met Gala?\u201d Paltrow replied, \u201cAre you crazy? I\u2019m like RuPaul! I have so much makeup on. Foundation! Last night, I was literally a transvestite.\u201d (Don\u2019t even start on the \u201cliterally.\u201d  That battle is lost, people.  We\u2019ve got plenty of words that mean \u201cin the real world, not metaphorically or metonymically.\u201d  Use them, and forget this one.) O\u2019Donnell created an image saying that Paltrow \u201cRidicules Trans People,\u201d and writes, \u201cTrans people are not objects to ridicule. While it may appear to be a thoughtless comment by an ignorant person, however, a celebrity of her stature yields quite a bit of influence among her fans, so she\u2019s going to have to own up to committing this very public blunder.  I wouldn\u2019t go so far to say Paltrow is transphobic, but she in dire need of education. If we can get her to apologize, she can redeem herself and send a bit of good PR our way.\u201d A lot of O\u2019Donnell\u2019s commenters said she was making too big a deal of it, to which O\u2019Donnell replied, \u201cRemember, those that do violence against trans people do not check for labels \u2014 crossdressers, transvestites, transsexuals \u2014 trans people are all one and the same to them.  Being mocked in the media by a celebrity, no matter how slight, normalizes this behavior.  While readers are free to give Paltrow a pass, I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m helping ensure that mocking trans people isn\u2019t so easily blurted out during interviews anymore.\u201d I\u2019m not really sure what ignorance Paltrow is exhibiting, let alone mockery, and what kind of \u201ceducation\u201d O\u2019Donnell has in mind for her.  Beyond that, though, where does O\u2019Donnell get off policing the word \u201ctransvestite\u201d?  It\u2019s clear from her September post that she doesn\u2019t identify as one, and doesn\u2019t understand the nuances of the word.  Why not leave it to someone who does? When I was a cute young thing I didn\u2019t need to wear any makeup at all.  But at 41, I\u2019m not just a transvestite but an aging transvestite.  I have to spend an hour slathering the stuff on just so that I don\u2019t see my beard shadow in the mirror.  It\u2019s a pain in the ass, and it\u2019s kind of nice to know that People\u2018s \u201cMost Beautiful Woman\u201d has to put up with it much more often than I do. I don\u2019t feel at all ridiculed by the comparison.  I don\u2019t feel mocked by someone who wears a lot of makeup pointing out that we do too.  I don\u2019t see how it could encourage people to violently attack us.  In fact, I feel sympathy and validation from Paltrow. I\u2019d appreciate it if O\u2019Donnell and (any other non-transvestite activists) could back off from the term \u201ctransvestite\u201d and focus on whatever flavor of trans she identifies with.  If we want her help, we can ask for it.  And actually, if she wants to give a signal boost to this effort, that\u2019d be nice. (P.S.
