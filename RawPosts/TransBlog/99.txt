For us, it\u2019s more than a corporate buzzword. It\u2019s an appreciation for all people. We believe every great adventure begins with an amazing experience.  Our goal is to provide that experience, time and time again. It doesn\u2019t matter who goes along for the ride. I\u2019m glad to hear that, but they\u2019ve got their work cut out for them.  I immediately thought about Chelsea Manning\u2019s trip on Amtrak in 2011, and went back to re-read what she told Adrian Lamo.  When one conductor saw the name \u201cBradley\u201d on her ticket, he intentionally misgendered her in a way that made her uncomfortable:  (03:17:04 PM) bradass87:i went on leave in late january / early february\u2026 and\u2026 i cross-dressed, full on\u2026 wig, breastforms, dress, the works\u2026 i had crossdressed before\u2026 but i was public\u2026 for a few days (03:17:33 PM) bradass87:i blended in\u2026. (03:17:34 PM) bradass87:no-one knew (03:18:06 PM) bradass87:the first thing i learned was that chivalry isn\u2019t dead\u2026 men would walk out of their way and open doors for me\u2026 it was so weird (03:18:19 PM) info@adrianlamo.com: awww. (03:18:51 PM) bradass87:i was referred to as \u201cMa\u2019am\u201d or \u201cMiss\u201d at places like Starbucks and McDonalds (hey, im not a fancy eater) (03:19:35 PM) bradass87:i even took the Acela from DC to Boston\u2026 whatever compelled me to do that\u2026 idk\u2026 but i wanted to see my then-still-boyfriend (03:20:01 PM) bradass87:i rode the train, dressed in a casual business outfit (03:20:36 PM) bradass87:i really enjoyed the trip\u2026 minus the conductor (03:21:06 PM) bradass87:as he asked for my ID, and clipped my ticket\u2026 he made a fuss (03:21:24 PM) info@adrianlamo.com: that sucks =z (03:21:26 PM) bradass87:\u201cThank you, MISTER Manning\u2026\u201d (03:21:31 PM) info@adrianlamo.com: asshole (03:21:35 PM) info@adrianlamo.com: him, not you (03:21:41 PM) bradass87:i know (03:21:53 PM) bradass87:it was\u2026 an experience i wont forget\u2026 (03:22:36 PM) bradass87:i mean\u2026 99.9% of people coming from iraq and afghanistan want to come home, see their families, get drunk, get laid\u2026 (03:22:56 PM) bradass87:i\u2026 wanted to try living as a woman, for whatever reason (03:23:14 PM) bradass87:obviously, its important to me\u2026 since there were plenty of other things i could\u2019ve done (03:23:23 PM) info@adrianlamo.com: Overall, how did you feel about your sojourn? (03:25:50 PM) bradass87:idk, i just kind of blended in\u2026 i didn\u2019t have to make an effort to do so, it just came naturally\u2026 instead of thinking all the time about how im perceived, being self conscious, i just let myself go\u2026 \u2026well, i was still self-concious, but in a different way\u2026 i was worried about whether i looked pretty, whether my makeup was running, whether i spilled coffee on my (expensive) outfit\u2026 and to some extent whether i was passing\u2026 (03:28:12 PM) bradass87:but i went to get gas\u2026 and bought cigarettes (i know, need to quit)\u2026 and the man asked to see my ID\u2026 so i did\u2026 and he about had a heart attack\u2026 he couldn\u2019t hold himself back, he looked up and down twice\u2026 and gave me this look like\u2026 WTF, it is the same\u2026 handed it back to me\u2026 and tried to keep himself composed\u2026 so i wasn\u2019t worried about whether i was passing as much, because he had no idea whatsoever (03:28:55 PM) info@adrianlamo.com: i smoze zero to five a day myself. (03:29:44 PM) bradass87:but the point was, i guess my face is androgynous enough that i can pass with ease (03:30:11 PM) bradass87:my prominent adams apple is the only issue i was concerned about (03:30:26 PM) bradass87:so i wore a turtleneck, and had collar up with my coat (03:30:29 PM) info@adrianlamo.com: yeah, i\u2019d say that re. the former. (03:30:38 PM) info@adrianlamo.com: which i find cute.  That\u2019s the relevant part, but the whole logs are worth reading. We\u2019re not talking like the conductor couldn\u2019t tell and made a guess.  Manning was wearing business casual women\u2019s clothes and makeup, and said that everyone else who saw her called her \u201cma\u2019am\u201d and opened doors for her.  This guy saw a man\u2019s name on her ticket and chose to make a big deal of it.  That\u2019s not cool. And from this we can conclude that if Amtrak really wants their customers to Ride With Pride, we need to know that that kind of treatment won\u2019t be tolerated.  Contact information for a trans-friendly ombudsperson would be a big step.", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
