I came out in 1996 \u2013 over twenty years ago!  And yet I\u2019m still uncomfortable talking about my sexuality.  I say the word \u201ctransvestite,\u201d but I don\u2019t stress what it means.  I posted a version of this last year as a private post on Facebook, but I\u2019ve been afraid to put it in a blog post, or even a tweet \u2013 afraid that if people find out it will destroy any credibility I have as a trans person, destroy my social life, and make people not want to hire me. On some levels it seems like we\u2019ve made such strides in terms of openness and acceptance of sexuality, and on other levels it feels like we\u2019re stuck back in 1950 or even 1880 and haven\u2019t moved an inch.  Even in terms of trans acceptance, we\u2019ve made progress, but only at the cost of a lot of us denying our sexuality.  Is that really progress? Anyway, I\u2019m a transvestite.  And yes, that means I\u2019m transgender.  Are you a transvestite too?  Happy National Coming Out Day!", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
