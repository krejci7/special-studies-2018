On this National Coming Out Day, a lot of it feels so old news.  I came out in 1996 – over twenty years ago!  And yet I’m still uncomfortable talking about my sexuality.  I say the word “transvestite,” but I don’t stress what it means.  I posted a version of this last year as a private post on Facebook, but I’ve been afraid to put it in a blog post, or even a tweet – afraid that if people find out it will destroy any credibility I have as a trans person, destroy my social life, and make people not want to hire me. On some levels it seems like we’ve made such strides in terms of openness and acceptance of sexuality, and on other levels it feels like we’re stuck back in 1950 or even 1880 and haven’t moved an inch.  Even in terms of trans acceptance, we’ve made progress, but only at the cost of a lot of us denying our sexuality.  Is that really progress? Anyway, I’m a transvestite.  And yes, that means I’m transgender.  Are you a transvestite too?  Happy National Coming Out Day!
