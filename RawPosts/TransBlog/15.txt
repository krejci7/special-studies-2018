I don\u2019t have much more patience for the Blanchard model either, but it seems to be the most popular alternative.  Alice Dreger is right that my \u201ccommunity leaders\u201d have been nasty to Ray Blanchard and friends, but she also seems to think that Blanchard\u2019s theory is actually worth something.  Last month I posted about the difficulties of coming out about transvestite sexuality, and I got a very nice email from someone who asked if that was the same as \u201cautogynephilia.\u201d  I found the blog of a therapist who questions transition, and she recommends that parents of dysphoric children read Michael Bailey\u2019s The Man Who Would Be Queen. Of all the books I could recommend to an anxious parent, The Man Who Would Be Queen is one of my last choices.  If you forced me to choose between that and a transition-cheerleading book I would probably throw them both in the pulping bin.  It\u2019s a nasty, polemical, judgmental screed that offers little hope to any trans people.  And that, really, is the message I\u2019ve gotten from the entire Blanchard camp. Ray Blanchard developed his dichotomy between \u201cautogynephilic\u201d and \u201chomosexual transsexuals\u201d in the 1980s, based on work by Kurt Freund and others in the late 1960s and early 1970s,* when the primary mission of therapists working with trans people was gatekeeping.  There was a real danger that people would make all kinds of body modifications, get fired from their jobs and ostracized by their friends and family, and wind up broke and destitute.  They found that the \u201cHSTS\u201d were more likely to succeed in their transitions \u2013 and in those days that meant blending into society post-transition and being able to live \u201cstealth.\u201d There was probably some value in the \u201cHSTS/autogynephilia\u201d dichotomy as a gatekeeping heuristic, just like there was some value in the \u201cwe\u2019re all women trapped in men\u2019s bodies\u201d idea for getting people to relate to transgender ideas at all, but they\u2019re both based on wild oversimplifications, ignoring a vast quantity of exceptions.  Both camps have spun elaborate essentialist theories and spent the past thirty years searching for biological evidence to support those theories, and neither camp has come up with anything particularly satisfactory. My biggest beef with Blanchard, Bailey and friends is that as far as I\u2019m concerned, they\u2019ve done fuck-all to help me and other trans people to cope with trans feelings.  I decided not to transition with no help from them, I came out of the closet a year later with no help from them, and I\u2019ve spent the 21 years since figuring out how to live out and proud without transitioning.  Where is their guide to doing that?  It\u2019s not there.  All they cared about for decades was preventing me from transitioning (didn\u2019t want to anyway), and attacking the Everybody Must Transition dogmatists. I wish I could offer the therapist a book she could recommend to worried parents instead of Bailey\u2019s book.  For that matter, I wish I could offer a book that people could recommend instead of Julia Serano\u2019s book.  The problem is that the parents want certainty.  They want a book that will tell them How Things Are, and What To Do.  But the fact is that when it comes to transgender feelings we don\u2019t know how things are.  We don\u2019t know what to do.  We\u2019re all fumbling blindly in the dark.  The difference is that some of us are prepared to admit it. * I had originally said that Blanchard developed his taxonomy in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Someone wrote to correct that.
