The first step is to enter your lover\u2019s fantasy world, (I mean my fantasy world), And be their fantasy. The next step is to let your lover, (I mean me), Be their fantasy. For you that may be the hardest part. Then there will come a time During your lovemaking When the fantasies run out, When there is no escaping reality, When your lover, (I mean I), Will have to face facts. The fact that you are two people, two animals, With real feelings that have been hurt before, With real fears and sore spots and longings. Then you must be ready To stop being fantasy you and start being real you, To stop making love to your fantasy lover and start loving the real person, (I mean the real me). You must be ready to be afraid and let your lover comfort you, To let them be afraid and comfort them, (I mean me), To be two people alone together, To be two animals grooming each other. You must be ready to take pleasure in the real person, (I mean the real me), To let them take pleasure in the real you, So that when you\u2019re done making love You will still have real love. When you\u2019re advanced you may be able to skip the first couple of steps. Sometimes. That\u2019s how to make love to a trans person, (Well, actually, me. Well, actually, there\u2019s only one person who can make love to me now. If that person isn\u2019t you, This might work for other trans people).", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
