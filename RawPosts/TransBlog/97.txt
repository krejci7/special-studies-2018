We\u2019ve evolved in tribes, and we have a strong tendency to take tribal solutions to danger and conflict.  Someone\u2019s dangerous? Well, he\u2019s not one of us.  She\u2019s not one of us either, better watch out for her! When we find out that x percent of crimes are committed by y people, our immediate reaction is to avoid all y people.  It doesn\u2019t matter if these crimes are committed by a small percentage of y people, better to avoid them all.  It\u2019s a completely normal and understandable response, and sometimes when you\u2019re under attack it\u2019s the best you can manage, but as DuPrau shows us, it\u2019s often the absolute worst thing you can do. There are \u201cwomen\u2019s spaces,\u201d because women fear men.  There are whites-only suburbs, because white people fear black and Hispanic people.  There are people who avoid contact with anyone who isn\u2019t LGBT, because they fear straight people. Then there are the numerous posts on Tumblr about \u201ccis\u201d people, as if our danger comes entirely from without.  Posts about what trans men do to trans women, as if trans women didn\u2019t do the exact same things to other trans women. If you\u2019re feeling backed in a corner and assailed from all sides, then go ahead and make whatever generalizations you think will protect you.  But if you\u2019re not, if you\u2019ve got at least some breathing room, I encourage you to take a deep breath and look around.  Because the truth is that safety does not lie with \u201cus.\u201d  No matter how you define \u201cus.\u201d There are trans women who rape.  Trans women who kill.  Trans women who inject each other with silicon.  Trans women who play shitty coercive games.  Trans women who keep other trans women from getting the help we need. Non-trans women? Yeah, some of them rape and murder and exclude other women.  Gay men? Lesbians? Yeah.  White people?  Hell yeah.  Rich people?  You bet. We are not safe around us.  Is anyone safe, then?  Well, nobody\u2019s completely safe, but some people are generally okay.  How do we find them? Well, that\u2019s tricky.  The best way is to observe them, from a distance at first and then gradually closer if they go for a while without doing anything dangerous. In other words, the best way that anyone\u2019s ever found to determine whether someone\u2019s safe: let them earn your trust.  Despite what we\u2019d like to believe, there are no shortcuts.", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
