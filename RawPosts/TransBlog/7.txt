There have been a lot of arguments over whether it’s okay for some people to not find trans people attractive. I’ve got things to say about that, but first I wanted to get some facts cleared up.  It’s not just trans women complaining about this.  Recently a masculine-spectrum friend told me he was upset that a partner of his might not be attracted to him as a man.  He wasn’t just personally hurt; he found it transphobic.  So despite what you might hear from certain radical feminists, this is not just a plot by “males” to eliminate lesbians.  It’s a concern for all kinds of trans people. Trans people are not inherently unattractive.  Just look at the successes of “shemale porn” and Buck Angel if you want counterevidence.  There are women who are attracted to trans women, men who are attracted to trans men, and trans and nonbinary people who are attracted to all genders. Sexual preference is not the only thing that determines attraction.  A woman once told me that she was attracted to both men and women, but she didn’t find tall women with big shoulders attractive, or short guys with big hips.  Just because people aren’t attracted to you doesn’t mean they’re not attracted to trans people. Attractiveness is not the same as validation of our gender presentation.  Someone can find me intensely attractive because they think I’m a cute guy in a skirt and not because they think of me as a woman.  Whether people mind this depends in part on how committed they are to their gender identifications.
