I\u2019ve got things to say about that, but first I wanted to get some facts cleared up.  It\u2019s not just trans women complaining about this.  Recently a masculine-spectrum friend told me he was upset that a partner of his might not be attracted to him as a man.  He wasn\u2019t just personally hurt; he found it transphobic.  So despite what you might hear from certain radical feminists, this is not just a plot by \u201cmales\u201d to eliminate lesbians.  It\u2019s a concern for all kinds of trans people. Trans people are not inherently unattractive.  Just look at the successes of \u201cshemale porn\u201d and Buck Angel if you want counterevidence.  There are women who are attracted to trans women, men who are attracted to trans men, and trans and nonbinary people who are attracted to all genders. Sexual preference is not the only thing that determines attraction.  A woman once told me that she was attracted to both men and women, but she didn\u2019t find tall women with big shoulders attractive, or short guys with big hips.  Just because people aren\u2019t attracted to you doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not attracted to trans people. Attractiveness is not the same as validation of our gender presentation.  Someone can find me intensely attractive because they think I\u2019m a cute guy in a skirt and not because they think of me as a woman.  Whether people mind this depends in part on how committed they are to their gender identifications.", "feedtitle": "Trans Blog"}
