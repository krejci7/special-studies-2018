I\u2019ve written an article about how hard it is to find out about transgender issues, and the difference between saying \u201cthere are people who are like this\u201d (scientifically justifiable), and saying \u201ceveryone who\u2019s this way is also that way\u201d (not scientifically justifiable without representative sampling).  Maybe some day we\u2019ll find out some Big New Discoveries, and then it won\u2019t be as true.  But there are limits to how much we can know about people, so we\u2019ll never completely understand what\u2019s going on, any more than we understand love or ham radio. But.  It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know anything.  We can make a lot of \u201csome\u201d statements, a lot of existential observations.  I\u2019ve made some complicated ones in Principles Two through Seven, and even ventured to make a categorical statement (about people in general, not just transgender people) in Principle Eight.  Now I\u2019m going to make a bunch of other \u201csome\u201d statements that I think are relatively uncontroversial, within the trans movement and outside it.  This is pretty much Trans 101 stuff, that I hope everyone can agree on, even anti-trans bigots (although they might choose different words). I\u2019m not going to talk about feelings or beliefs here, or sexual activity, or relationships, because those areas are much trickier.  I\u2019m also going to try and stay within a reference frame that\u2019s accessible to outsiders, and avoid doing framing tricks like \u201cI was never cross-dressing, because I was always really a woman inside.\u201d  Most people can be unambiguously classified as male or female based on their physical sex characteristics. Some people cannot be unambiguously classified as male or female, and some people who were thought to be unambiguously one sex are later discovered to have characteristics of the other sex. People assign each other to genders, sometimes on the basis of sex characteristics, but often on the basis of social cues that signal membership in one gender or another. Some people cross-dress.  By this I mean that some people who are assigned to one gender sometimes intentionally present social cues signaling that they\u2019re a member of another gender.  This usually involves clothing, but can also involve other forms of grooming, and modification of voice and body language. Some people pass, at least some of the time.  They were assigned to one gender, but sometimes other people categorize them as a member of a different gender.  This may be the intention of the person passing, or not.  It may be true for any length of time, from a split second to an entire lifetime. Some people cross-live.  They were assigned to one gender, but they intentionally present the cues of another gender, and are accepted as that gender, to a greater or lesser degree, all the time, for a long time. Observations 1 through 6 have been recorded throughout history. Some people modify their bodies, or arrange to have their bodies modified, to have less of the sex characteristics of one gender, and more of the characteristics of a different gender.  This has been going on for a long time, but in the past hundred years technology has advanced and now people can achieve a greater resemblance, often with more comfort and less danger, than before.  I think at this point that this is pretty much all that can be said about transgenderism without getting into the problematic areas of feelings, beliefs, sexuality and relationships.  If you think there\u2019s something I\u2019ve gotten wrong, or left something out, please feel free to email me or post a comment. You may notice that I\u2019ve left out things like the stria terminalis; I\u2019ll probably have to address that at some point, but right now I\u2019ll just say it hasn\u2019t been proven. I\u2019m not completely sure what the point of this is, but I felt it would help me to have as \u201ctheory-neutral\u201d a description of transgender phenomena as possible.", "feedtitle": "Page 19 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
