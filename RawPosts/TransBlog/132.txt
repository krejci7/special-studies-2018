I know that the authors wanted to do something to help the trans community, and they thought that was what they were doing.  I want to balance that out by highlighting examples of transgender research done right. I recently had the pleasure of meeting Lal Zimman, a fellow linguist who studies transgender language.  In 2009, Zimman published a paper (PDF) summarizing his research into the concept of \u201ccoming out\u201d in transgender communities. A.C. Liang (1997) and Kathleen Wood (1997) reported on \u201ccoming out\u201d stories of gay men and lesbians.  In these stories, the term \u201ccoming out\u201d is used to refer to the sharing of a sexual orientation.  Because this orientation may not be visible, Zimman says, \u201cLiang argues that reference to the \u2018processual\u2019 nature of coming out \u2013 in other words, the fact that coming out is not a single event but is rather reenacted time and again throughout an individual\u2019s lifetime \u2013 is a crucial component of the coming out narrative.\u201d Zimman interviewed nine individuals who had completed a gender transition and found a pattern that will probably be familiar to a lot of you.  They used \u201ccoming out\u201d to share a transgender identity, but in one of two specific ways that were very different from those reported for gay men and lesbians.  Those who hadn\u2019t transitioned to their target gender used \u201ccoming out\u201d to mean a declaration (in Zimman\u2019s terms) of their desire or plans to transition to a different gender.  Those who had transitioned used \u201ccoming out\u201d to mean a disclosure of their history of gender transition. This is the right way to do research on an unrepresentative sample.  Ask relatively open-ended questions and listen to the answers.  Note common threads among the answers.  Use the stories to make existential arguments \u2013 ones that highlight the existence of something that may not have been acknowledged by the academic community.  This is particularly valuable to show exceptions to generalizations that others have made.  In this case, Zimman identifies exceptions to the generalizations that Liang and Wood made about coming out narratives. Even though I think Zimman\u2019s research is exemplary here, I want to note that I have a verbal hygiene argument with what he found.  I don\u2019t like these uses of the term \u201ccoming out,\u201d and I think they\u2019re bad for both the trans community and the wider LGBT community.  But that\u2019s a topic for another post.  In the meantime, keep studying trans communities!", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
