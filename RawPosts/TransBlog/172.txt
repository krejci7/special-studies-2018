General News 
Not too far away from me there’s a small homeless shelter for transgender and GLB youth ages 17-24.  The church that housed the shelter had to close, and now they’re in a rented two-bedroom apartment.  A recent New York Times article gives details.  Here’s the shelter’s website and their Myspace page – which includes contact information if you want to volunteer and a Paypal link if you want to donate money.
