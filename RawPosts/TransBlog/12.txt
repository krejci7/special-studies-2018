I agreed with this and lived it, and it got me into trouble.  I would fight with kids when they told me not to cry, and get punished in school for refusing an assignment that felt too conformist. In high school one of my classmates went on a long rant about plaid.  The next day I dressed for school in a plaid shirt and a homemade button that said \u201cPlaid Rules!  If you don\u2019t like it, FUCK OFF!\u201d  (I then thought better of it and covered it with a piece of paper that just said \u201cPlaid Rules!\u201d but he ripped the paper off.) The point of all this is that I had no trouble showing my true self to people, and never have.  When I started trying on my sister\u2019s clothes in junior high it was not about identity, it was about loneliness, jealousy and fear. There is a story trans people like to tell, that gender expression is about bringing out the \u201cauthentic self\u201d that we\u2019ve been hiding from others all our lives.  This is a cousin of the \u201cwoman trapped in a man\u2019s body\u201d story that was popular in the late twentieth century.  It\u2019s at best a gross oversimplification of the little we know about the diverse and variable motivations for unexpected gender expression. Some people talk about my feminine expression as a different person: \u201cWhen are we going to see Andrea again?  Have they met Andrea yet?\u201d  I do use a different name and pronouns, and speak and move differently, when I\u2019m wearing a skirt and make-up.  But this is not because I am \u201creally\u201d Andrea inside.  It\u2019s because I want people interacting with me to have a consistent experience. The fact is that I feel like the same person no matter what I\u2019m wearing.  Maybe if I\u2019m wearing a dress I can express some things I can\u2019t express when people see me as a guy, but that\u2019s true the other way too.  Is my true self just too big to fit in one gender? If it\u2019s not to express my true self, why do I want people to see me as a woman?  Honestly, I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t know why it matters.  All I know is that I treat myself and the people around me with respect and compassion no matter what I\u2019m wearing, and that\u2019s all that should matter. Part of treating people with respect and compassion is taking their gender presentation at face value.  If someone sends me a signal that they want to be treated as a man I\u2019ll treat them as a man.  I don\u2019t need to know whether their true self is a man or not.   Does this mean that my authentic self has no gender?  Probably.  But am I then part of a small minority, in a world full of strongly gendered selves?  My conversations with other people suggest otherwise.  I\u2019ve known transitioners who were similarly non-conforming before transition, and some who, before transitioning, identified strongly with their assigned genders. I strongly suspect that the authentic self has no gender.  Trans people have a variety of reasons for transitioning \u2013 or not.  \u201cBeing your true self\u201d is either a convenient fiction, like \u201cI\u2019m a man trapped in a woman\u2019s body,\u201d or a religious belief, like \u201cGod made me trans.\u201d  This particular one resonates with people raised with be-yourself values. These destiny statements are very useful for transitioners, giving them a story that satisfies at least some of the doubters, and may even quiet their own doubts.  They\u2019re not so good for non-transitioners and genderfluid people like me.  They do a special disservice to people who are trying to decide whether transition is right for them.  Please think about all of us the next time you\u2019re tempted to repeat one of them.", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
