When they knew they could change their minds about the painting, they were less happy with it.  This explains a lot about the way decisions and commitments are made.  If you\u2019ve made a very difficult choice that affects every aspect of your life, like marriage, a job or a child, you\u2019re going to have mixed feelings about it, and from time to time feel a desire to change your choice.  The easier it is to make that change, the more time you\u2019ll spend thinking about it, and the less time you\u2019ll spend adapting to the choice you made.  In the end that means more satisfaction. The implications for \u201ctransition optional\u201d transgender people are clear: we will have difficulty making peace with our choices unless we\u2019ve ruled out the other choices.  This makes it easier to understand the origins of transgender dogma.  If you believe that it\u2019s your destiny to live as a woman no matter how many people insist you\u2019re a man, you\u2019re going to think less about the choice you\u2019ve already made.  On the other hand, if you believe that you\u2019re \u201cjust a crossdresser,\u201d you\u2019ll be less likely to think maybe you should transition after all. The result is that we get a lot of people claiming to be \u201ctransition or die\u201d or \u201ctransition and be miserable\u201d when in fact we\u2019re transition optional.  We do this for our own sanity, our own peace of mind.  But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s without problems.", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
