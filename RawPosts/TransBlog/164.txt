When I first asked about this at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center in 2000, I was told that changing clothes in the bathrooms was not allowed.\u00a0 Things have changed significantly since then.\u00a0 In 2004, Donna from the My Husband Betty message boards posted that there was an unofficial policy allowing people to change clothes in the \u201cAll-Gender\u201d bathrooms on the second floor.\u00a0 Within the next two years, that policy was made official and the rules against changing clothes were removed from the lists.\u00a0 I have changed gender presentation several times in those bathrooms over the past three years, and the staff and other visitors have always been perfectly supportive. This, to me, is one of the most important \u201ctransgender community services\u201d that a center can offer.\u00a0 I hope you will agree with me, and tell that to the Center management when you take their Community Survey.", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
