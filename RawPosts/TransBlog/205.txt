According to Metafilter, transvestite B-movie director Ed Wood does not have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  Hollywood horror and costume shop The Dapper Cadaver is running a campaign to raise money for the star.  Apparently, all you need is $15,000.  If, as Celebrity Stink (sorry for the ugly ads) reports, there are stars for George Lopez and the Olsen twins, the standards must be low enough for Wood.  Wikipedia has an extensive list of stars on the Walk of Fame.
