Growing out of a discussion of whether a McCain presidential campaign ad aims to present Obama as the Antichrist, Postrel has a great post about the relationship between glamour and horror.\u00a0 She writes: While horror comes in different forms, some decidedly unglamorous (e.g., Alien, Saw), a lot of horror, including vampire tales, depends on glamour: What starts out as beautiful and alluring is revealed to be terrible and life-destroying\u2013and by then it\u2019s too late. Witness not only the vampire but the femme fatale, especially in her 19th-century form. Glamour promises escape and transformation; horror replaces escape with entrapment. (With regard to gross-out \u201chorror\u201d movies like Saw and Friday the 13th, I\u2019d say that they\u2019re more appropriately called \u201cterror movies.\u201d\u00a0 Sadly, that term has now been appropriated by the terrorism frame, but before that there were some insightful discussions of the contrast between terror and horror.) This explanation of horror helps me to understand some of the various \u201ctrans fatale\u201d movies (Dressed to Kill, Homicidal, M Butterfly): if the idea of the femme fatale plays off of men\u2019s fears of unexpectedly strong women, then the trans fatale has the glamour of being beautiful and alluring, but are even more threatening because they can be imagined to possess the physical strength and aggression (and ability to rape) of men. Going further, it seems connected to the \u201ctrans panic\u201d that some men have claimed: they believed they were kissing a vulnerable woman, and on discovering that the person was male they were overwhelmed with the fear that they had been seduced and would be raped or killed.\u00a0 This is often, horribly, used to justify beating and even killing the trans person.\u00a0 Of course, a male who is small or slim enough to pass as a vulnerable woman usually has no more strength than a woman that size, and any trans woman on hormones probably doesn\u2019t have much ability or desire to penetrate a man, but reality plays very little role in any of this. Deconstructing glamour with reality is actually an effective comedy technique, and this can explain why so many people find cross-dressing funny.\u00a0 Since men have many of the traits that are considered unattractive in women (hairy, sweaty, big bellies), but more commonly and to a greater degree, a cross-dressed man can produce just enough cues to project the image of a glamorous woman (long wig, long legs, short skirt) before shattering that image with a hairy belly.\u00a0 The humor is a bit broad for my taste, but it clearly works for many people, as shown by the enduring popularity of Benny Hill and Martin Lawrence.", "feedtitle": "Page 16 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
