Ann Schimke of Chalkbeat reports that the survey shows that transgender teenagers in the state are more likely to plan or attempt suicide than their non-trans classmates. Unlike some surveys, this is based on an actual sample of 15,970 high school students in Colorado, with a 46% response rate. 2.2% of the kids (162) said they were trans, and 1.6% (118) said they were questioning their gender. 35% (57) of the trans kids said they had attempted suicide, and 14% (16) of the questioning kids said they had. The reported rate of attempted suicide for the other kids is 7%. That\u2019s 53 more high school kids in Colorado who say they\u2019ve attempted suicide than would have if they hadn\u2019t been trans. I\u2019ve got more thoughts on suicide, but the biggest thing is that we need to work on accepting kids who are trans. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean any body modifications. Just accepting would make a huge difference. I say that from experience.", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
