I have real reasons to be happy about my excursion on Saturday.  I have a great friend.  My co-workers are super cool.  But that’s not how gender fog works with me.  Instead, it keeps me up all night thinking about things like this: I’m so hot. Don’t you think I’m hot?  I’m in soft focus.  I’ve lost so much weight! I wonder if I’m a 38C or a 36D. That guy who held the door for me totally didn’t read me. I bet nobody did! I definitely fit in with all those cute tourist women.  I was prettier than a lot of them. I could rock the dress that woman was wearing on the subway yesterday. Would the brown skirt I bought go better with a black top or a white one? I so want to go out in that green dress. Maybe this weekend. Can I get the time off? Makeup is such a pain. I wonder how much laser costs. Can I really wear a strappy sundress? I’d definitely need to get rid of my T-shirt tan lines first. I could have gone to work in a dress yesterday. No, maybe that wouldn’t be a good idea. Well, at least I could’ve gone to the coffee shop in a dress. Who cares what my neighbors think? Is my video camera good enough to make a haul video?
