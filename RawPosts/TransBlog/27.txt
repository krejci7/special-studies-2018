You can read the first installment here.  I have already written the entire article in long form, if you want to read the whole thing right away. On the slippery slope, a trans woman\u2019s feelings, actions and identity all work together in a ratchet mechanism.  One part of the mechanism is sunk costs.  Just an average woman\u2019s wardrobe and grooming supplies can cost a lot of money.  Even if we don\u2019t buy a complete wardrobe the expense is in addition to our men\u2019s wardrobe.  If we are in the closet at all, we may pay to rent a separate place to store our clothing and change into it, or to join a club for that purpose.  Any specialized makeup, wigs or padding is additional, and training is on top of that. These can cost a lot; we tend to think of them as investments and want to get value from them.  I spent sixty dollars on a pair of boots last winter, and I was pretty happy once I found a chance to wear them. Time is another sunk cost.  We spend time on voice training, time practicing wearing clothes and shoes and walking in them.  Women on average spend more time than men on grooming; trans women often have to spend even more time on things like shaving and make-up. To save time, we may spend even more money on what Helen calls \u201csoft body mods\u201d like shaving or electrolysis.  We may try to avoid growing big muscles.  If we have a full head of hair, we may grow it long.  We may forego beards or mustaches because we don\u2019t want to look conspicuous after we shave them off. Further down the slope, some of us get more dramatic body modifications, even if we don\u2019t intend to transition.  Some people get facial surgery, others take \u201ca low dose\u201d of hormones to get small breasts. All of that money, all of that time, all the opportunities we\u2019ve passed up are sunk costs.  They all whisper to us, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be doing more with this?  Nobody\u2019s seen my legs yet this summer.  Those boots are just sitting in the closet.  I spent an hour getting my makeup and now I\u2019m going to take a few selfies and wipe it off?\u201d This concludes the sixth installment of the Slippery Slope.
