I was tremendously relieved.  I didn\u2019t want to be a transvestite.  I didn\u2019t want a closetful of clothes that could get me mocked and rejected.  I didn\u2019t want to look into my mom\u2019s eyes and see nothing but worry and pity.  I didn\u2019t want to harbor a secret that could get me blackmailed. Twice I purged.  I threw away all the women\u2019s clothes I had collected, painstakingly, sometimes illegally, over the course of years.  I put my past out of my mind.  I no longer had anything to hide.  That part of my life was over. But that part of my life was not over.  What I eventually discovered was that my transgender desires come and go with my gender dysphoria \u2013 my discomfort with my life as a man.  When I feel satisfied with my life as a man, my desire to be a woman diminishes.  I will not feel completely satisfied with my life, every day until I die.  And when I am feeling particularly dissatisfied, life as a woman will seem like a great escape. Life as a woman certainly seemed like a great escape when I was twelve.  Of course it isn\u2019t, I know that now.  I learned from listening to women, and a few fleeting, incomplete experiences of living as a woman were enough to drive the point home.  But when I\u2019m feeling trapped and hopeless, the dysphoria returns. As I\u2019ve said before, I don\u2019t think the dysphoria always gets worse.  But it does come back, and with it comes the desire to be a woman, to look like a woman, to dress like a woman.  That\u2019s what happened to me after the two times I purged.  That, in turn, is why I don\u2019t purge any more, and why I don\u2019t ever believe I\u2019ll be \u201ccured.\u201d  If I did purge, I might enjoy some extra closet space for a while, but soon enough I would wind up paying again for expensive clothes and makeup. I actually wouldn\u2019t mind a cure for the trans feelings.  None of them are very pleasant, even the euphoric post-event gratification.  I\u2019m not one of those people who think being trans is a gift.  But I just don\u2019t see it happening.  Some day we may figure out how to prevent it, but I doubt we\u2019ll be able to cure it.", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
