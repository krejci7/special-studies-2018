As clips from Izzard\u2019s live shows played, one of the interviewers said, \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful watching these highlights, it\u2019s a journey of outfits for you.  Famously, you\u2019ve dressed up in women\u2019s dresses.\u201d  Izzard responded, \u201cNo, I wear dresses.  They\u2019re my dresses, I buy them.  It\u2019s like when women wear trousers, they\u2019re not cross-dressing.  They\u2019re not wearing men\u2019s trousers, they\u2019re wearing trousers.\u201d  Someone liked that quote enough that they made one of those distracting animated gif sets that are all over Tumblr, and people have been reblogging it around the world.  After it showed up on my dash for the third or fourth time I said, \u201cI gotta write a post about this. Izzard is probably the trans person I admire most in the world, but I disagree with him on this.\u201d  The Transfeminist Geometer said, \u201cLet me know if you write a post. I agree pretty strongly with Eddie Izzard, so I\u2019d be interested to read it.\u201d  And here it is. There is one interpretation of \u201cthey\u2019re my dresses\u201d that could be said by someone who identifies as a woman.  It means that of course they\u2019re women\u2019s dresses, because I\u2019m a woman, so there\u2019s nothing noteworthy about me wearing them. I don\u2019t think Izzard is identifying as a woman here, with his beard and all (although it would be damn radical if he did).  I think he\u2019s saying it as a statement of sartorial freedom, along the lines of the people who make utilikilts, and the fashionistas who tell us every so often that this is the year when men will start wearing skirts again.  It means that these dresses may have been designed for women, but once I pay for them they\u2019re mine, so they\u2019re men\u2019s dresses or transvestite\u2019s dresses or something. I disagree with Izzard here because for me the point is that they are women\u2019s dresses.  I don\u2019t have any particular interest in a utilikilt or a men\u2019s skirt.  In fact, last week I went out wearing leggings under a sweater and jacket, but I\u2019m thinking I don\u2019t feel like wearing that anymore because they looked too much like the kind of spandex pants a guy might wear. It\u2019s like if you imagine a society in the future where everyone wears identical jumpsuits, but the women\u2019s jumpsuits have one button more than the men\u2019s.  The transvestites will all want that extra button.  Not because they like an extra button, but because it\u2019s a woman\u2019s button.  That\u2019s why I have women\u2019s dresses in my closet.  My women\u2019s dresses. Obviously, Izzard has a right to his own feelings about his dresses.  He\u2019s not wrong for that, and neither is the dude in a utilikilt, or the transwoman who buys her women\u2019s pants at the Men\u2019s Wearhouse.  My disagreement with them is purely that I having different feelings. But I wonder how different Izzard\u2019s feelings really are.  It\u2019s possible that he thought that up just because he was tired of answering the same question about \u201cwomen\u2019s dresses\u201d for so many years and wanted to say something different, just to mix things up and be funny.  Kind of like I\u2019m pretty sure he was joking when he told Greg Kilborn that the police shot him for shoplifting a makeup kit when he was a teenager.", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
