Claudia says that the police in Jackson Heights are much more respectful than in Hunts Point, focusing on keeping the overall area safe. \u201cThe men get rowdy, get drunk, and behave awfully. I don\u2019t care if these women are men, nobody has a right to treat them like garbage.\u201d See more photos by Chris Arnade in his Flickr set, and read some of the sex workers\u2019 own stories. In theory I agree that it\u2019s worth disseminating potentially inaccurate information if you believe that it\u2019s going to help people regardless.  In practice it\u2019s never easy to predict what effect your actions will have.  In this particular case, I think that reports like these do more harm than good for a very specific reason: they obscure important differences. Baral\u2019s study was actually a \u201cmeta-study\u201d that combined studies done in cities all over the world.  All of these studies investigated non-random samples of transgender people, usually focusing on subgroups that are at particular risk for violence or disease.  They all include disclaimers saying \u201cNON-REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE NO NO DO NOT GENERALIZE RESULTS!!!\u201d One of the source studies turned out to be the study that I participated in here in New York, led by Larry Nuttbrock of the National Development and Research Institutes (NDRI).  In November I criticized the study for overgeneralizing, but as I mentioned in May, the study does reveal some important things, which may very well be found in other communities. In particular, the NDRI study reveals the deep divide here in New York between the lives of middle-class white trans people and lower-class black and Hispanic trans people.  The difference in HIV infection rates (3.5% vs. 48-50%) between the two groups of participants in the study is huge.  In another paper, the NDRI researchers indicate that HIV infection tends to correlate with unprotected anal sex, which in turn tends to correlate with gender abuse and symptoms of depression, as well as with attraction to men and nonwhite ethnicity. What that means, in turn, is that middle-class white trans people like me are not at significant risk for HIV infection, or gender abuse, or depression.  To use a fancy social science term, it\u2019s intersectional: if you\u2019re black or Latina, if you\u2019re feminine, if you\u2019re attracted to men, if you\u2019re poor, if you\u2019re a prostitute, it all adds to your risk.  And as Hwahng and Nuttbrock observed, it\u2019s all about power: the power to say no to unprotected anal sex. That\u2019s why you won\u2019t see me using this study to get anything for myself.  These high HIV rates don\u2019t apply to me.  I don\u2019t deserve any of the money that governments and donors want to spend on it.  I don\u2019t know which donors Baral is trying to convince, or what he wants them to spend the money on, but it shouldn\u2019t be middle-class white people. This is not a problem of \u201ctrans women\u201d or even of transgender people in general.  It is a problem of disempowered black and Latina transvestites, and it can only be solved by re-empowering them.  As Erica so eloquently put it, nihil de nobis sine nobis. Of course I\u2019m concerned about these high HIV rates, because I care about my fellow transvestites, and my neighbors.  That\u2019s why I\u2019m prepared to act in support and solidarity, and I hope you are too.  But don\u2019t talk to mainstream transgender organizations that aren\u2019t doing anything about this issue.  Talk to organizations that empower sex workers of all genders, like the Red Umbrella Project.", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
