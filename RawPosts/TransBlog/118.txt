I\u2019ve taken a stab at explaining the general problem with these two pages, A Skeptic\u2019s Trans 101 and Before You Reblog, but I haven\u2019t addressed the BuzzFeed post specifically. The first problem with Kasulke\u2019s post is that it\u2019s not everything you always wanted to know about trans people but were afraid to ask. It\u2019s just the latest version of the same old trans dogma dressed up as a Q&A. Here are some things she focuses on that are just not burning questions in people\u2019s minds:  Should I say \u201ctransgender\u201d or \u201ctransgendered\u201d? What do all these fancy words you keep using mean? Am I a horrible person for being skeptical of this true inside gender you claim? I haven\u2019t heard nearly enough about hormones from trans people. Please tell me more! There are genders besides boy or girl? Are drag queens transgender? Should I use the pronouns you clearly want to hear, or the ones I want to say? Do people ever get upset when someone calls them \u201cit\u201d? Should I call trans people shemales?  No, the things that everyone always wants to know about trans people are more like this:  Are you a man or a woman? So you\u2019re gay? Have you had the surgery? What happens during the surgery? How do you have sex? Are those real? How do you hide it? Why would you do this to yourself? Isn\u2019t there some kind of therapy for this? Can\u2019t you just be a butch lesbian? What does your mom think? What do your kids call you? Is your wife really okay with it? Can I have sex with you? Not because I like you, but just to satisfy my own curiosity and then move on to a real woman?  and yes:  What is your real name?  I\u2019m not saying that anyone deserves answers to these questions. But the genius of David Reuben\u2019s original book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (but Were Afraid to Ask) is that it took a topic where there was so much shame and prudery, chose questions that were actually in people\u2019s minds, and answered them without moralizing. It was a breath of fresh air after the tedium and taboo of what had passed for sex education before. Kasulke and Ritter\u2019s piece reads more like the books that Reuben was reacting to. It\u2019s full of moralizing, shame and taboo. If someone\u2019s afraid to ask \u201cwhat\u2019s your real name?\u201d how are they going to feel after reading Ritter\u2019s slide? Despite Kasulke\u2019s subtitle, she clearly doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s cool to have questions like that, and she\u2019s not going to answer them. I\u2019ll tell you what: I\u2019ll answer your questions. If you read my Skeptic\u2019s Trans 101 and still have questions, poke around on the site a bit. If you still have questions, email me. And if you see a post like Kasulke and Ritter\u2019s, please check my list before you forward it. Update: Two weeks after I posted this response, Kasulke (now Calvin Kasulke) posted \u201c17 Questions Trans People Are Tired of Hearing.\u201d  I don\u2019t know how much BuzzFeed paid him, but I\u2019m still waiting for my cut.", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
