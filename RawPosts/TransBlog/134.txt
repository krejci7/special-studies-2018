The action alerts also talked about \u201cgender identity,\u201d and the definition that came to mind is this one from GLAAD, which is echoed in other definitions around the country: \u201cOne\u2019s internal, personal sense of being a man or a woman (or a boy or a girl).\u201d Photo: UltraViolet.orgI was concerned about the use of \u201cgender identity\u201d in this bill.  Being white and middle-class I\u2019m at relatively low risk, but there are other trans people from all ethnic and economic backgrounds who occasionally go out in public presenting as women, with male bodies unmodified by hormone or surgical treatment, and without a strong belief that we are women.  We may be seen by others as women, as trans people or as gay men.  We may be targeted for sexual assault, stalking or other violent actions based on those perceptions.  A law that is based on the \u201cinternal sense\u201d definition of gender identity would fail to protect us. Today I took a closer look and discovered that this fight actually is relevant to people like me.  The Violence Against Women Act, originally passed in 1994, provided grants for nonprofits and government agencies to run programs aimed at preventing violence against women and providing support for women who are victims of domestic and sexual violence. The expanded version of the law passed by the Senate last year, but rejected by the House of Representatives, and then passed this week by both houses of Congress, includes new protections that weren\u2019t in the original bill.  Overall, it includes \u201cdating violence\u201d and \u201cstalking\u201d as eligible categories of violence in addition to \u201cdomestic violence\u201d and \u201csexual assault.\u201d  It also includes provisions for \u201cmen, women, and youth in correctional and detention settings.\u201d One part that relates to transgender and LGB victims is the definition of \u201cunderserved populations.\u201d  There are grants for organizations working with underserved populations. UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS.\u2014The term \u201cunderserved populations\u201d means populations who face barriers in accessing and using victim services, and includes populations underserved because of geographic location, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, underserved racial and ethnic populations, populations underserved because of special needs (such as language barriers, disabilities, alienage status, or age), and any other population determined to be underserved by the Attorney General or by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as appropriate. Another section expands the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include support for the following: developing, enlarging, or strengthening programs and projects to provide services and responses targeting male and female victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, whose ability to access traditional services and responses is affected by their sexual orientation or gender identity, as defined in section 249(c) of title 4 18, United States Code In section 249(c) of the hate crimes law is where we actually get a legal definition of \u201cgender identity,\u201d and it turns out to be very different from that given by organizations like GLAAD: the term \u2018gender identity\u2019 means actual or perceived gender-related characteristics This definition is much broader than the \u201cinternal sense\u201d definitions, but does a better job of delineating the class of victims who are underserved, and who are often actually denied services when people perceive them as \u201cqueers\u201d or \u201ctrannies,\u201d with no knowledge of their internal sense of gender. The people who refuse to investigate or prosecute crimes against transgender people don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass what internal, personal sense of gender those transgender people have.  If I (or someone like me who\u2019s black or Mexican) get bashed and a cop won\u2019t write it up, telling the cop that I really don\u2019t have an internal, personal sense that I\u2019m a woman isn\u2019t going to get me any better treatment.  That\u2019s probably why the definition in the hate crimes law didn\u2019t reference a sense of gender, and why this expanded Violence Against Women Act doesn\u2019t either. A final note: in the spirit of the Delhi protesters who said \u201cDon\u2019t tell your daughters to stay at home, instead teach your sons to behave,\u201d I like this program in the new Violence Against Women Act: ENGAGING MEN AS LEADERS AND ROLE MODELS.\u2014To develop, maintain or enhance programs that work with men to prevent domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking by helping men to serve as role models and social influencers of other men and youth at the individual, school, community or statewide levels.", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
