(The author, posting as \u201cBoldly Go,\u201d* calls them \u201cepistemologies,\u201d but they seem to be what I\u2019ve heard called \u201contologies\u201d or \u201ctaxonomies.\u201d  I think \u201ccategories\u201d is the most straightforward term. And yes, I do recognize the irony there.)  Boldly Go also makes the point that these categories are referred to as \u201csocial constructs,\u201d which mean that they\u2019re not essential and can vary from culture to culture \u2013 and, critically, that they change over time, even in a single individual. Boldly Go argues persuasively that abolishing gender is not a realistic approach.  We all have a basic need to categorize people: who is a potential ally, sex partner, life partner, co-parent, leader, friend, collaborator?  Who is a potential attacker, rival, rapist, burden?  Figuring all those things out based on the individual characteristics of everyone we encounter would be exhausting and time-consuming, so we use roles and spaces based on gender and other categories as shortcuts.  This becomes truly problematic when we forget that these categories are only shortcuts, when we essentialize them. Here\u2019s my favorite part of Boldly Go\u2019s post: Hidras of Panscheel Park II, New Delhi, India, 1994. Photo: R. Barrez D\u2019Lucca / Flickr. For example, a great many people familiar with the trans* community may have heard of hijras, a concept of gender that exists within South Asia. A great many usually white trans* people have called hijra\u2019s \u201ctrans*\u201d or put them under the trans* label. Regardless of their intention, to take the epistemology of \u201ctrans*\u201d and apply it to something like the hijra can be seen as an oppressive or colonising act. The hijra are hijra. That is their name. Unless a hijra specifically identifies as transgender or trans*, applying our own concepts of gender and sexuality constructed within white supremacist cultures to people outside of our epistemological framework is redefining them on our own terms for our own benefit. They (that\u2019s Boldly Go\u2019s preferred pronoun) go on to talk about two-spirits and quote their friend Tiara\u2019s thoughts about gender in Malaysia and Bangladesh, and to argue that gender abolitionism is colonization in the same way. Much as I agree that it\u2019s not realistic to abolish gender, I think it\u2019s not realistic to ignore our own gender categories when trying to understand people from other cultures.  We may say, \u201cthat\u2019s kind of like our idea of \u2018transgender,'\u201d but it becomes problematic when we ignore the way others categorize themselves.  It becomes colonization when we seek to replace their categories with our own.  And it\u2019s downright offensive when we act as though our way is the One True Way of categorizing the world. This is not to say that it\u2019s all relative, and all categorization systems are equal.  Some may have particular virtues relative to others.  But we can\u2019t just assume that our own categorization system is superior.  We have to make a coherent argument for it. I\u2019m less concerned with borrowing another culture\u2019s categories.  If it\u2019s done respectfully and with full credit and an open mind, it isn\u2019t appropriation.  It\u2019s just recognizing that other people may have come up with a better way of doing it than we did. I\u2019ll have more to say on this in the future. * Boldly Go seems to have let her domain expire, so I\u2019ve changed the link to point to a copy she posted on Medium under the name Lola Phoenix.", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
