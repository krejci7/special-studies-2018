The problem is that my students need me to have a clear head tomorrow, and just thinking about wearing the dress makes it hard for me to think clearly about anything else. The dress is really pretty: a black cotton-silk wrap with a full mid-calf skirt and flower prints along the hem.  When I bought it I didn\u2019t expect to have many occasions to wear it, but the price couldn\u2019t be beat.  Then my friend Alice invited me to go see \u201cCasa Valentina,\u201d and I can\u2019t think of a more appropriate place to wear it. Unfortunately, my final exam is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon.  Even though this was the first class I\u2019ve come out to and they\u2019ve been cool about it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the time for me to wear something so dramatic. They need to concentrate. I wasn\u2019t seriously thinking of wearing the dress to class; my actual plan was to go to my office downtown and change there, but that would mean carrying a lot of bulky clothes and shoes around with me in addition to the exam papers and my tablet.  So I had thought of bringing the clothes to my office today. The thing is that I need to concentrate too.  Supervising an exam is not that demanding, but I do need to pick up the exams, be on the lookout for any foul play, and answer student questions.  I also need to be able to think clearly afterwards, so that I grade the exams fairly and speedily.  And for all that I need to not be gender-fogged and I need to be reasonably well rested. As I started to think about packing a bag, I felt the rush of gender fog hit me.  I was excited and a bit jittery, and I had a hard time thinking about anything else I had planned for the day.  I decided that if I did wear a dress to the play, I wouldn\u2019t plan it out over two days.  And still, my thoughts kept coming back to the play, and every time I felt the same rush.  I\u2019m feeling it now as I write this. This is just not a good week to have gender fog.  Hopefully I\u2019ll have a chance for a less exciting outing soon.  Maybe I\u2019ll even get a chance to wear that dress some time, and maybe I\u2019ll be able to manage it so that the gender fog isn\u2019t overwhelming.  But this week I need to get work done, so I\u2019ve decided not to wear it tomorrow.  And that\u2019s okay.", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
