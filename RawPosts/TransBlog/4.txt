I have been asked for my opinion on the debate over whether it’s okay for lesbians to preemptively restrict their sexual partners to people who fit their definition of women, in particular excluding anyone who has a penis. The bottom line is that everyone has an absolute right to control their own sexual activity, and to say no to sex with anyone, under any circumstances. People also have a right to decide who they want to flirt with, to date, to fantasize about.  Everyone has an absolute right to exclude any individual or group from their pool of prospective romantic partners, for any reason. To be honest, it would be hypocritical of me to say anything else, because I am pretty much only attracted to women.  Not on principle, and not with a specific definition of woman that anyone else would agree with, but that’s what turns me on.  None of that really matters at this point, because I haven’t been sexually active with anyone other than my wife since before we were married, and I’m very attracted to her. This issue is particularly important to me because I was touched, without my consent, as a child.  But it is something that everyone should care about, because it is a matter of physical and emotional autonomy.  Even beyond the individual level, if we cannot all feel safe in our bodies, what effect does that have on our society?
