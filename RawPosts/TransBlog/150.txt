When I first started cross-dressing, I knew that it was not acceptable.\u00a0 I had heard so many people making fun of transvestites that I didn\u2019t think that anyone would value or support me if I told them I was one.\u00a0 For over a year I did my cross-dressing in secrecy and isolation. One day my mother came into my room and said, \u201cThis closet is a mess!\u00a0 I\u2019ve given you so many chances to clean it up.\u00a0 Now I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, Mom, but just don\u2019t open the top drawer.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s in the top drawer?\u201d \u201cJust don\u2019t look in it.\u201d \u201cAngus, what\u2019s in the top drawer?\u201d After a few more rounds of this, I told her.\u00a0 Her response was not as bad as it could have been (the horror stories we\u2019ve heard about teenagers being rejected by their parents, thrown out of the house, beaten, or even killed), but it was not encouraging.\u00a0 I won\u2019t go into too much detail, since she apologized for it many years ago, but she was ashamed, and worried that I might be gay.\u00a0 She insisted that I go to therapy, which was probably a good idea, but I didn\u2019t even mention cross-dressing to the first therapist.\u00a0 The second one was helpful in various ways, but not with regards to this issue. I avoided talking to my mom about cross-dressing after that, until I came out in general.\u00a0 That meant that I was pretty much alone in the closet for another fourteen years.\u00a0 And that time was hell.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know which was worse, the feeling of shame when I cross-dressed, or the feeling of relief when I purged.\u00a0 Every time the topic came up in general conversations with anyone other than my mother I had to remain silent, afraid that I would be ostracized if anyone found out.\u00a0 The chronic fear of being found out was a source of discomfort throughout my teen and college years. Since I\u2019ve come out, I know that there is a group of people that I can rely on, who have shown me that they support me no matter what I\u2019m wearing.\u00a0 I don\u2019t need to feel ashamed around them.\u00a0 Even if I don\u2019t feel comfortable telling absolutely everyone, it\u2019s still liberating to know that there are many people who don\u2019t judge me for my gender expression. Unfortunately, it took a long time for me to feel comfortable coming out.\u00a0 I had to tell one person at a\u00a0 time, until I knew that there were enough people who supported me.\u00a0 This is why one of my goals is to encourage widespread, open, vocal support of non-conforming gender expression, so that the teenagers of tomorrow can live outside the closet. A simple thing you can do for trans people is to say something supportive every time the topic comes up.\u00a0 You can do this for gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, cyclists, or any disenfranchised group.\u00a0 You might want to have a handy phrase or two ready ahead of time.\u00a0 And if you can\u2019t think of anything supportive to say, educate yourself!", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
