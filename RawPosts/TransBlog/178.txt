I have a scientific caveat to make.  Lakoff was trained by Noam Chomsky, and although he broke publicly with Chomsky in the 1970s, he still uses Chomsky\u2019s methods of introspection and grammaticality judgments.  When Chomsky wants to prove a grammatical point, he invents sentences in English and classifies them as \u201cgrammatical\u201d or \u201cungrammatical,\u201d and builds his arguments on those judgments. When Chomsky\u2019s students study languages that they\u2019re not native speakers of, they invent sentences in those languages, find a native speaker and ask that person for grammaticality judgments.  This method assumes that grammaticality judgments (a) are valid and unbiased, and (b) hold for every other speaker of the language, assumptions that are not justified. Lakoff does something similar with his list of \u201cbut tests\u201d that are judged as \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cstrange,\u201d and I repeated this in my discussion.  These informal judgments are useful for speculation, but they have the same problems as Chomsky\u2019s grammaticality judgments.  However, the notions of radial categories and prototype effects are based on more than this.  Eleanor Rosch herself did reproducible psycholinguistic laboratory tests, and most of the Lakoff work that I\u2019ve described can be accounted for with tests like these. The laboratory version of the \u201cbut tests\u201d are reaction-time tests.   In her 1973 paper \u201cOn the internal structure of perceptual and semantic categories,\u201d Rosch presented subjects with a number of sentences and asked them to press different keys for \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse.\u201d  She measured the time it took the subjects to hit a key after the sentence appeared.  There was a significant difference between sentences like \u201cA robin is a bird,\u201d where robins are central members of the category bird, and sentences like \u201cAn ostrich is a bird,\u201d where ostriches are peripheral members of the category.  The average adult reaction time for central members was 1012 milliseconds, while the time for peripheral members was 1061 milliseconds. Lakoff\u2019s \u201cbut tests\u201d examine whether a particular subcategory is central to the category; they can also test whether a particular criterion marks a member of the category as central.  It seems like Lakoff\u2019s subjective notion of \u201cstrangeness\u201d is exactly what a reaction test is designed to measure; if it is possible to present these \u201cbut sentences\u201d in an experiment and ask subjects reasonable questions about them, their reaction time could be a reproducible measure of \u201cstrangeness.\u201d Unfortunately, as far as I know nobody has done this kind of measurement, so the case for radial structure of gender categories rests on introspection.", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
