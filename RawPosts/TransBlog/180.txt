I know they were both nervous about being \u201cambassadors of the trans community\u201d on the show, and being able to get any kind of coherent message out while sitting in those chairs under the lights.\u00a0 I think they did a great job, and I\u2019m glad they got the word out that it\u2019s possible to put your relationship before the trans and still be satisfied with your life.\u00a0 I\u2019m also impressed with Dr. Keith himself: he seems like a genuinely caring and open-minded guy.", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
