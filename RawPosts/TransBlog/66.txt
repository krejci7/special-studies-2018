One observation is that what I\u2019ve been calling \u201cgender fog\u201d has at least three distinct phases to it: the anticipation of a significant gender event, the event itself and the reaction to the event.  I\u2019ve never experienced one phase without the others, but the feelings I feel in each phase are somewhat different.  The anticipation phase is the most uncomfortable for me.  I experience intense excitement, insomnia and difficulty concentrating on anything other than the upcoming event.  I find myself planning and rehearsing and rehashing all the details: what I\u2019ll wear, where I\u2019ll go, who I\u2019ll see, and so forth.  On the day of the event, I may have shaky hands and low appetite. The excitement may taper off as the event begins, particularly if what I\u2019m doing is not all that exciting in itself.  But the feelings of satisfaction and gratification may grow, even if my feet are hurting or strange men are making me uncomfortable. After the event, I tend to feel a certain satisfaction.  I feel particularly gratified if the event goes well, but usually I feel some gratification even if the event wasn\u2019t particularly satisfying.  I often replay the event in my mind, focusing on the most gratifying details: who said what, who did what, what looked good on me in the mirror. In this gratification period I also find myself thinking about future events: what else would be fun to do?  If I see a pretty woman on the street, I may compare myself with her, and feel a desire to be out there on the street looking just as pretty as her.  If I bought new clothes, I usually try them on at home and think about when I could wear them in the future.   The gratification period is also when I think most about how \u201ceasy\u201d the event was (often because I\u2019ve filtered out the difficult parts in my memory) and how much fun (often because I\u2019ve filtered out any unpleasant parts).  I find myself thinking about the possibility of spending longer periods as a woman, or doing it more often.  If it begins while I\u2019m still presenting as a woman, that\u2019s the time when I may do something unwise, like the time I went home to the South Bronx without changing first. I\u2019ve toyed with the idea of separating the notion of \u201cgender fog\u201d into two feelings: anticipation and gratification.  At this point I\u2019m leaning towards simply talking about them as two distinct phases in the gender fog process, but I might change my mind about this.", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
