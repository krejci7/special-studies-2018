A few months ago I lost a friend over pronouns.  There were other factors, but the breaking point happened when this former friend was complaining about a neighbor of ours, a trans woman.  I agreed that it sounded like the woman was being a jerk, but after my former friend told me the story, she called her \u201cit.\u201d I asked her not to dehumanize our neighbor that way, things escalated, and I haven\u2019t talked to her since.  I had to change a number of regular routines to avoid my former friend, and the whole experience was very upsetting, but I would do it again in an instant.  All for a neighbor who\u2019s never said a word to me.  Sometimes pronouns are a big deal. I mention this now because there\u2019s another case that\u2019s a lot less clear-cut.  Last week I went to the vigil for Islan Nettles, who was murdered in Harlem.  I\u2019ve been trying to figure out how lives like hers could be saved in the future, but Janet Mock is worried about pronouns, and her post has been going around the net, so I want to respond to it. My heart dropped each time I watched your face cringe with each misgendering. This is more than semantics, more than a family issue, this is our lives. We all know Islan was beaten to death because she fought hard to be Islan, to be she, to be her. We don\u2019t all know that.  I didn\u2019t know that at the time, so I asked.  .@SmartAssJen @JanetMock I'd appreciate it if people who object to Nettles being called \"he\" gave proof that Nettles herself objected to it. \u2014 Angus B Grieve-Smith (@grievesmith) August 28, 2013  Jen Richards was angry:  .@grievesmith @janetmock Islan was murdered because she was a trans woman. Your call for 'proof' is a distraction and hurtful. Stop. \u2014 Jen Richards (@SmartAssJen) August 28, 2013  Laverne Cox told the Huffington Post: I know as a trans woman, and I think so many trans women in the audience understand, that when we\u2019re misgendered, that is an act of violence for us. It\u2019s a part of the violence that lead to Islan\u2019s death. No.  Misgendering can be a whole range of things, from an honest mistake to incitement to violence, but in itself it is not an act of violence.  It\u2019s not part of the cause of Islan Nettles\u2019 death.  Nettles was not murdered because she was a trans woman.  Here\u2019s what the New York Post reported: Paris Wilson, 20, is said to have made a pass at Nettles and was shocked to learn she was not born a woman, sources said. Humiliated in front of his crew, Wilson then got into a heated argument with Nettles and the other women, hurling derogatory slurs at the group. The two eventually came to blows, but Wilson eventually overpowered Nettles, beating her to a pulp, sources said. The problem with Richards\u2019s argument \u2013 and with Mock\u2019s \u2013 is that you don\u2019t have to use female pronouns for this to happen to you.  It happened to B. Scott in 2009: I was just called a faggot by Lewis Dix Jr. of the Jamie Foxx @Foxxhole radio show because he saw me and was confused/attracted. [\u2026] people don\u2019t know what gays like me go thru. he came from across the room to speak to me cuz he was attracted and then I said I was a man. If this had been at a different kind of party \u2013 if it had happened on the corner of 148th and Bradhurst, with a violent enough person \u2013 B. Scott might have been killed that night.  It wouldn\u2019t have been because he was a trans woman, because Scott called himself a man right then.  It wouldn\u2019t have been because of pronouns, because Scott doesn\u2019t reject \u201che\u201d pronouns. Scott has recently begun identifying as trans, and a few weeks ago I gave props to Mock for accepting him as such, even when Monica Roberts wouldn\u2019t.  But she stopped short of identifying him as a \u201ctrans woman.\u201d My wife pointed out that this happens to non-trans women as well.  If a man finds out that a woman he\u2019s attracted to is lesbian or that she not interested in him, or if she responds in the \u201cwrong\u201d way, he can feel humiliated and take it out on her. There\u2019s a whole range between B. Scott\u2019s 2009 presentation and pronouns and Janet Mock\u2019s current presentation and pronouns.  Ultimately, the \u201cright\u201d pronouns are not the matter of faith that Mock makes them out to be.  It\u2019s not \u201ctrans woman\u201d = \u201cshe\u201d pronouns.  It\u2019s what the person wants.  It\u2019s respectful to use \u201cshe\u201d pronouns for Chelsea Manning because Chelsea Manning told her lawyer to tell everyone to use \u201cshe\u201d pronouns. Some people want one set of pronouns, some want another, some don\u2019t care.  When I present as a woman I prefer \u201cshe\u201d pronouns, but if I were killed in a dress I would expect (and prefer) that my family and most of my friends would use \u201che\u201d pronouns, because that\u2019s how they\u2019ve known me. From what I\u2019ve heard it sounds like Nettles\u2019 pronoun preference was closer to Mock\u2019s, but it\u2019s not obvious that she would have objected to anyone using \u201che\u201d pronouns, especially not her family, and maybe not even a certain well-meaning but clueless Gay Man of African Descent.  That\u2019s why I asked for some evidence that she cared. Here we have someone who wasn\u2019t murdered for pronouns and didn\u2019t necessarily object to her family using \u201che\u201d pronouns.  We have a family who says they\u2019re ready to fight for justice and community leaders who say they want safety for all. The intent of the pronoun user matters as well.  When my former friend referred to our neighbor as \u201cit,\u201d I could hear the hate in her voice.  In Delores Nettles we have a woman who has shown she is ready to fight for justice for her child, and we tell her that she\u2019s not doing it right because she said \u201che was a beautiful woman,\u201d instead of \u201cshe was a beautiful woman\u201d? Those of you who are putting the focus on pronouns: I want to know how you think pronouns are the solution.  You\u2019ve already schooled Vaughn Taylor.  Suppose that tomorrow you could get everyone on that stage, in that park, to switch to \u201cshe\u201d pronouns forever, just the way you want.  Suppose you could do that for everyone in Harlem, in New York, in the whole country.  What would that accomplish? Please tell me how \u201cshe\u201d pronouns would have saved Islan Nettles\u2019 life, when so many unquestioned \u201cshes\u201d have been killed in Harlem.  I\u2019m looking forward to your evidence.  I\u2019ve got a Ph.D. in language change, and I\u2019d be happy to help guide your research if you need it. I completely understand if Mock, Richards and a lot of other trans people were carried away by the anger and frustration they felt at the moment.  But if we want to actually solve this problem and save lives in the future, we have to put the pronoun issue in perspective.  This is not about pronouns, or about being accepted as women. This is a danger for transitioned trans women like Nettles, but not for trans women alone.  Trans women don\u2019t own Islan Nettles\u2019 murder, they don\u2019t own murders of gender-non-conforming people, and they don\u2019t own murders of women.  Transitioned trans women don\u2019t know how to make Harlem safe, and they don\u2019t have the right to dictate other people\u2019s response to this tragic killing. I hope that Mock and Cox will back off the pronoun agenda and refocus their efforts on building safe, welcoming communities for all women and gender-non-conforming people.  And I hope that everyone who\u2019s reblogged and linked Mock\u2019s post will now re-read the New York Post\u2018s description of the events leading up to the murder of Islan Nettles \u2013 or any other detailed account \u2013 and try to think of one thing that might have prevented it.  And write that up, too.  Thanks.", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
