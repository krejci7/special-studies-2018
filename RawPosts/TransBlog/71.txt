I spent a lot of time on my makeup, and it paid off: only one \u201csir\u201d and four \u201cma\u2019am\u201ds.  I found a nice full skirt that balanced out my shoulders, and decided to wear it to the bar to show off. As I was relaxing with Eddie and Kyle and Lisa over my first beer, the door swung open wide and a man barreled in, with several shopping bags.  He was tall and broad-shouldered, with collar-length salt-and-pepper hair and a long shaggy beard, wearing what looked like they might once have been elegant silk robes, but they were dusty and torn.  He waved at Gina and squeezed himself and his shopping bags into the bathroom. \u201cNew gal?\u201d I asked. \u201cOh, that\u2019s right, you don\u2019t usually come on Fridays.  That\u2019s Sissy,\u201d said Lisa. \u201cLet me guess, she\u2019s going to come out in some frilly little-girl dress with petticoats?\u201d \u201cWhat?  Oh, yeah, that\u2019s what I thought too when I heard that name.\u201d \u201cLike the other Sissy who comes on Thursdays,\u201d said Kyle. \u201cBut no, she says she\u2019s had that name for a very long time.  Isn\u2019t she going by a different name now, Eddie?\u201d \u201cYeah, um\u2026 Anna, I think.\u201d  He stared at my legs.  \u201cSo, Traci, new skirt?\u201d Eventually the door opened and she came out.  She had shaved and done a pretty good job with the makeup, but if you ask me the sundress she had on drew too much attention to her big muscular arms.  Eddie got up and bought her a beer, and they came back and sat with us.  Anna settled wearily on a barstool and smiled at me. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Anastasia, Ana for short.  I\u2019ve been coming here for a year, but I haven\u2019t seen you.\u201d  She had an elegant European accent of some kind, maybe Spanish or Slavic. \u201cHi Ana, I\u2019m Traci.  I usually come on Saturdays, but I got the day off today, and I bought this new skirt!\u201d  I stood up and gave it a twirl.  Eddie and Kyle and Lisa clapped politely. \u201cVery nice, it balances your shoulders.  And your nail polish matches.\u201d \u201cI had some time before this place opened, and I liked the skirt so much I stopped in Walgreen\u2019s and picked up this nail polish.\u201d  I dug it out of my purse and waved it around.  \u201cPlum pomegranate.\u201d \u201cPlum pomegranate!\u201d Ana made a face.  \u201cSo are you transitioning?\u201d \u201cMe, nope.  I just do this on weekends.  Blow off steam.\u201d \u201cYour wife lets you walk around with plum pomegranate nail polish?\u201d \u201cNah, I\u2019m going to wipe it off before I go home.  She doesn\u2019t mind a little residue.\u201d \u201cVery accommodating.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s the best.\u201d  I looked down at my hands.  \u201cThis time I got it on smoothly in two coats.  Only got a little on this pinky.\u201d \u201cVery good.\u201d  She looked me up and down.  \u201cSo tell me something, Traci.  If you are only out for three hours, why put on nail polish at all?\u201d \u201cGood question.  Sometimes I don\u2019t feel like putting on nail polish.  But it\u2019s good practice.\u201d \u201cGood practice, yes.  But if you are not transitioning, why are you practicing how to put on nail polish?\u201d \u201cHm.  Well, it will probably come in handy for SuperFemmeCon in August.\u201d \u201cAre you planning to spend the whole time en femme at SuperFemmeCon?\u201d \u201cI hope so, if I can get the lady to give the okay.  Why do you ask?\u201d \u201cBecause everyone who goes to SuperFemmeCon tells me they go, spend the whole time en femme, and at the end of the weekend they feel tremendously let down and wish they could transition.  Why go, if you will feel horrible afterwards?\u201d \u201cWhy go?  I take it you\u2019ve never gone?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Ana, sadly.  \u201cI\u2019ve never gone.  I cannot leave the greater New York area.\u201d \u201cWow.  Old ball and chain really weighing heavily on you.\u201d Her eyes widened.  \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d \u201cYou know, the metaphor.  Your wife, she\u2019s like a ball and chain around your ankle.\u201d  I pantomimed dragging around a ball and chain. \u201cAh, a metaphor.\u201d  She stared bitterly at her wine. \u201cYeah.  Well, SuperFemmeCon is fun.  It\u2019s a welcome change from the same old thing.  Who wants to get dressed up in the same old clothes every Saturday night, same makeup, drink the same beers and have the same conversations with the same people?\u201d \u201cWho, indeed?\u201d \u201cI mean, doing the same thing over and over again is really boring!  A gal needs a sense of progress.  Improve the makeup, improve the clothes, take a voice lesson, maybe save up for a little laser.\u201d \u201cAnd yet you said you were not transitioning.\u201d \u201cNope.  Not for me.  Uh-uh.\u201d \u201cSo why invest time and money into things that you will use maybe once a week?\u201d \u201cWell\u2026 Maybe if I had laser I would go out more than once a week.  Maybe I could swing a Friday every couple of weeks.\u201d \u201cWould your wife like that?  Would she want to spend that money on laser?\u201d \u201cWell, no.  Um\u2026\u201d Suddenly a voice crackled from Ana\u2019s purse.  \u201cSisyphus, your time is up!\u201d  All of a sudden, her beard started to grow.  We all just stared, and within thirty seconds it was the length it had been when she came in.  She sighed and stood up.  \u201cWell, good night, guys.\u201d \u201cWait, your name is really Sisyphus?\u201d I cried.  \u201cSomeone named you after that guy\u2026\u201d She gathered her shopping bags, turned her back on me, and walked into the bathroom.  After a few minutes she emerged in her old robes, with her face pretty cleaned up considering, waved sadly and went out into the night. I looked at Eddie and Kyle and Lisa.  \u201cSomeone actually named her after the guy who rolled the big rock up the hill forever?\u201d Lisa looked at me.  \u201cHere\u2019s the deal, Traci.  Last year, Olympus passed a package of transgender protections and benefits.\u201d \u201cOlympus.  You mean Mount Olympus where the Greek gods live, not the camera company.  I think they\u2019re out of business anyway\u2026 Never mind.\u201d \u201cSo one of the first to claim benefits was Sisyphus.  After all, he was cursed to roll the rock up the hill because he was clever and deceitful.  Everyone figured he was faking it.\u201d \u201cFucking transtrender,\u201d mumbled Kyle. \u201cMaybe he was hoping the hormones would make him too weak to handle the rock.  But Hermaphroditus looked deep in his soul and found-\u201c \u201c-that he had the soul of a woman?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo, silly.  You know there\u2019s no such thing as the soul of a woman.  Souls have no gender.  Hermaphroditus found that Sisyphus did not have strong enough dysphoria to qualify for hormones.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cBut Hermaphroditus did find evidence of mild transgender desire.  So Sisyphus was given three hours off every Friday.\u201d \u201cJust enough time to come in here, shave and have a glass of wine,\u201d said Kyle. \u201cAnd then start all over again next week,\u201d said Eddie. Lisa shook her head.  \u201cPoor cursed soul.\u201d \u201cYup.\u201d  I looked down at my nail polish and my freshly shaved legs.  \u201cPoor cursed soul.\u201d", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
