I hope this will get some action on the matter. AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA PRESS RELEASE Friday, October 27, 2006 NYPD Must Investigate Response to Alleged Assault of Transgender Woman at McDonald\u2019s, Says Amnesty InternationalCharges Against Sforza Dropped But Justice Still Not Served, Group Says (New York) \u2014 Amnesty International called on the New York Police Department to investigate possible human rights violations by its officers in their handling of the case of Christina Sforza, a transgender woman involved in an altercation at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Manhattan. Sforza claims that officers responding to the incident failed to exercise due diligence in not taking seriously her claim that she was the victim of a hate crime, that they subjected her to false arrest and that they further abused her while in their custody. All charges against Christina Sforza were dropped on Thursday, October 26. \u201cThe NYPD needs to conduct an immediate and impartial investigation into the incident \u2014 and hold accountable anyone found responsible for abuses,\u201d said Michael Heflin, director of OUTfront, Amnesty International USA\u2019s program on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) human rights. \u201cIf Sforza\u2019s allegations are substantiated, these are serious human rights violations. The allegations of mistreatment by police are especially troubling because they fit a pattern of abuses that Amnesty International has documented.\u201d Amnesty International members around the world are writing letters to Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly urging his immediate attention to the issue. Sforza asserts that she is not guilty of the charges that were filed against her \u2014 \u201cassault with intent to cause physical injury\u201d and \u201charassment in the second degree.\u201d She says that she was the one who was physically assaulted on July 10 at the McDonald\u2019s restaurant at 341 Fifth Avenue by a man she believes to be the manager. Sforza reports that after being in the bathroom for a minute or two the manager began yelling, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, faggot.\u201d She alleges that when she opened the door the manager hit her across the head with a lead pipe and kept hitting her in the head, torso and groin, and on her arms when she tried to protect herself. Sforza told Amnesty International that other staff and customers were cheering and yelling \u201ckill the fag.\u201d One of Sforza\u2019s friends called the police, but when they came she says they refused to listen to her side of the story and arrested her after the manager claimed she had assaulted him. Sforza reports that officers verbally abused her, refused to allow Emergency Medical Services personnel on the scene to examine her injuries and denied her access to diabetes medicine essential to her wellbeing while she was detained overnight. Amnesty International is concerned that the alleged violations in this case may constitute discriminatory behavior, torture or other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, false arrest, failure to exercise due diligence, and denial of access to justice. Amnesty International\u2019s Stonewalled report, released in September 2005, documented numerous incidents of alleged inappropriate police responses to violence against transgender persons and found that transgender people are at heightened risk of police abuse. The report found that police officers often do not respond appropriately to \u201chate crimes\u201d in which a transgender person is the alleged victim. This includes failure to properly investigate and document the \u201chate crime\u201d as well as sometimes blaming the victim and even arresting or threatening to arrest the victim of the \u201chate crime.\u201d \u201cThis is about accountability and this is about justice,\u201d said Heflin. \u201cThe NYPD has a choice \u2014 it can show it cares about ensuring justice for all people, or it can turn a blind eye.\u201d # # # To view Amnesty International\u2019s 2005 report Stonewalled: Police Abuse and Misconduct Against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People in the U.S., please visit: www.amnestyusa.org/outfront/stonewalled", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
