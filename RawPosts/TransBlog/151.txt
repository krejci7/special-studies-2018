Pretty obvious, huh?\u00a0 Well, I guess it\u2019s not so obvious to the bashers and killers.\u00a0 But to me it\u2019s the top priority in anything transgender-related.\u00a0 We can make it Principle One and move all the others down, or make it the Zeroth Principle like Isaac Asimov.\u00a0 Either way, I can\u2019t think of anything more important.", "feedtitle": "Page 16 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
