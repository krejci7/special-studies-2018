I believe those were the words he used.  He said, \u201cShe looked and sounded just like a woman, but she had to take a break and shave around five o\u2019clock.\u201d It\u2019s hard to know how much things like this affect your thoughts, but the story stuck with me, and it was probably swimming around in my head when I started thinking that life might be a lot easier if I didn\u2019t correct people when they thought I was a girl.  It went in there with Holly Woodlawn\u2019s cross-country gender change in \u201cWalk on the Wild Side,\u201d Princess Ozma, a girl named Patrice in my elementary school who bore an uncanny resemblance to a boy named Donavan at my summer camp, Bugs Bunny, and any number of madcap comedies where a boy disguises himself as a girl. Years later, after I developed a habit of wearing women\u2019s clothes and came out to my father about it, I asked him for more details about the movie.  He didn\u2019t remember it quite that way.  It turned out that the actress in question was Candy Darling, an associate of Holly Woodlawn\u2019s in Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory, and the movie was called Some of My Best Friends Are\u2026 It was an ensemble piece about gay life in Greenwich Village, set in a single bar on a Christmas Eve, and was released three days before I was born. When the film came out, Vincent Canby unfavorably compared it to The Boys in the Band, which I haven\u2019t seen, while noting that it \u201cmay well be more accurate.\u201d  Citizen Kane it ain\u2019t, but it\u2019s not horrible.  Candy Darling\u2019s performance in the film was straight dramatic acting, unlike her campy performances in Warhol\u2019s movies.  And my dad didn\u2019t tell me that she played a transvestite who was attacked for being trans. I looked up Some of My Best Friends Are\u2026 last night and discovered that someone had put the scenes with Candy Darling on YouTube.  My dad was right that she did pass well; I was a bit envious.  I was also impressed at how well the director, Mervyn Nelson, captured the feeling of gender fog, even if it was a bit over the top.  But I found the bashing scene very disturbing.  I\u2019ve never been comfortable with movie violence, but the fact that the character Karen was attacked in part for passing so well, in a bar full of men who tried and failed to protect her, was particularly upsetting. Things may be better now than they were in 1971.  More people are out of the closet, and gay bars are probably safer for transvestites, at least for those of us who are white and middle class.  But for those who are poor or nonwhite, things are still dangerous.  At least ten trans women have been killed this year in the United States.  The character of Karen survived being beaten; how many people survived a similar beating this year? If you want to change things, here are two ideas: (1) make sure everyone knows that you don\u2019t think we should be beaten or killed, and (2) leverage intersectionality to make life safer for trans people who are poor, nonwhite, sex workers or perceived as \u201cgay.\u201d", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
