Now this implied elasticity or variability of nature is directly opposed to the principles of magic as well as of science, both of which assume that the processes of nature are rigid and invariable in their operation, and that they can as little be turned from their course by persuasion and entreaty as by threats and intimidation. The distinction between the two conflicting views of the universe turns on their answer to the crucial question, Are the forces which govern the world conscious and personal, or unconscious and impersonal?     Things (rule-governed) People (relationships, prayer)   Empirical Science Society   Faith-based Magic Religion    Frazer does not really discuss the fourth quadrant of the chart, dealing with non-supernatural beings on a personal level, but it\u2019s not very relevant to the main point, which is situating magic with respect to science and religion.", "feedtitle": "Page 16 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
