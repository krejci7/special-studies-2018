I was a gender-non-conforming child, and overall I agree with most of those, but I would never have put them that way. I most definitely do not sign onto Duron\u2019s #1, and I wouldn\u2019t have when I was a child.  If you asked me whether my sex and my gender aligned (by that definition) I would\u2019ve said yes.  That did not make me gender conforming. I also didn\u2019t subscribe to her #3. I was trying to make some people uncomfortable.  I was much more into genderfuck rebellion in elementary school than I\u2019ve ever been since. I was more like four years old here. Here is my best attempt to reach back through time and channel my eight-year-old self.  In the spirit of my #1, and in the grand tradition of Epimenides, take it with a huge grain of salt.  Kids can speak for themselves.  Listen to us.  Don\u2019t listen to some grownup who says they know what we want.  Don\u2019t ever pretend to be one of us, cause you\u2019re not. Definitely don\u2019t listen to women who say they know what we want.  What\u2019s with all these women taking care of us?  Can I talk to a man? Why do women always Peter Pan in plays and movies, anyway?  It\u2019s not fair.  Peter Pan should be played by a boy! It\u2019s all right to cry.  Boys cry too. It\u2019s not fair that girls and women get to wear pants or skirts, but boys can\u2019t wear skirts.  No, I don\u2019t want a kilt. Yes, I know my name is Angus, I still don\u2019t want a kilt. It\u2019s not fair that girls can have long or short hair, but people make fun of me for having long hair. I just have long hair because my mom won\u2019t cut it short enough. Sports are unfair. People shouldn\u2019t watch horror movies because they\u2019re scary and not real.  They should watch happy movies, and Star Wars. Girl chase is unfair to the girls. I refuse to chase girls. I won\u2019t go inside the nursery school.  Stephanie, my teacher, wore tights yesterday. Boys can dance too.  They can\u2019t be ballerinas, but they can be ballet dancers.  They can dance modern dance too, like my mom\u2019s friend Dennis.  I want to dance, but I don\u2019t want to be the only boy in the class. Miss Mary Mack and Miss Lucy and jump rope and jacks look like fun. They should let boys play too.  And yes, I\u2019m aware that I sounded like a child.  I was one.", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
