Weisberg and her colleagues came up with a list of interesting psychological phenomena.\u00a0 For each one, they created two explanations: a \u201cgood\u201d one corresponding to the usual explanation given, and a \u201cbad\u201d one, which was usually circular.\u00a0 They found that their subjects (who were not particularly knowledgeable about psychology) were capable of distinguishing the bad explanations from the good ones. The researchers changed the explanations, adding a few words of neuroscience that was consistent with the explanation.\u00a0 They were very careful to ensure that it was identical to the explanation given, so that it added no new information.\u00a0 The subjects who received the explanations with neuroscience were much less capable of distinguishing the bad explanations from the good ones.\u00a0 Specifically, the researchers write, \u201cthe addition of such neuroscience information encouraged them to judge the explanations more favorably, particularly the bad explanations.\u00a0 That is, extraneous neuroscience information makes explanations look more satisfying than they actually are, or at least more satisfying than they otherwise would be judged to be.\u201d The study was repeated with students taking an introductory neuroscience course; unfortunately, \u201ca semester\u2019s worth of instruction is not enough to dispel the effect of neuroscience information on judgments of explanations.\u201d\u00a0 It was repeated again with experts in neuroscience, who were found to be immune to this effect. The authors conclude, \u201cSince it is unlikely that the popularity of neuroscience findings in the public sphere will wane any time soon, we see in the current results more reasons for caution when applying neuroscientific findings to social issues.\u201d\u00a0 In other words, be skeptical and try to compensate for this effect.", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
