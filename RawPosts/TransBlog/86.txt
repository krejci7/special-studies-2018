Very well, then, I contradict myself. I am large, I contain multitudes. -Walt Whitman When I posted my transgender feelings in January, there were some interesting reactions.  I want to clarify some of what I said and elaborate a bit. Feelings and beliefs A number of people interpreted my reports of trans feelings as evidence for \u201cinteriority\u201d \u2013 claims that I\u2019m really a woman inside.  These interpretations are understandable given how often other trans people offer their own feelings \u2013 or simply the word \u201ctrans\u201d \u2013 as part of such arguments.  They\u2019re inaccurate, though: as I wrote in a subsequent post, I find it hard to believe in anything as ineffable as a gender identity or an inner woman, and I don\u2019t ask anyone else to.   Feelings are irrational Some people were bothered by how little sense my feelings made, and how to some extent they rested on idealizations, fantasies and media images.  I think it\u2019s because when they talk about their own feelings, they expect them to make sense.  I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ve long ago given up on expecting my feelings or anyone else\u2019s to make sense.  I thought I made that clear in the post.  Maybe my feelings are more irrational than other people\u2019s, but I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s normal for feelings to conflict with each other I feel both a desire to be a woman and a desire to be a man.  Some people take that as evidence that a person is \u201cnot really trans,\u201d that they\u2019re bigender or something.  I take it as evidence that they\u2019re human.  I find it hard to believe there\u2019s a person on this planet who hasn\u2019t felt both of these desires.  I find it harder to believe that there\u2019s a trans person who doesn\u2019t feel some desire for their assigned gender, or some discomfort with their target gender. Moving toward and away from genders When I posted about my trans feelings, I included both a desire to be a woman and a desire to not be a man.  I think those feelings coexist, but they\u2019re not the same thing, and it\u2019s useful to be able to distinguish them.  Similarly, sometimes I feel a desire to be a man, and a desire to not be a woman, which are also distinct feelings.", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
