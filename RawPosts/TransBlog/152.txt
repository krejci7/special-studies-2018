He was the first openly gay professor that I had ever come in contact with, or openly gay person of authority that I had come in contact with. And he was just a terrific guy. \u00a0His comfort in his own skin and the friendship we developed helped to educate me on a number of these issues. I, too, had an experience like that: a fellow student of mine who was willing to tell anyone and everyone that he was gay.\u00a0 Steve wasn\u2019t an authority figure (although I would meet plenty later), but still an example of pride and self-acceptance who inspired me to reexamine and discard my homophobia.\u00a0 I had known many closet cases and \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d gay men, lesbians and bisexuals, and their own shame and fear had given me license to judge them.\u00a0 I just couldn\u2019t do that with Steve, and after a while I realized that I couldn\u2019t do it with myself either. This is the reason why I think we non-transition-track transgender people (transvestites, cross-dressers, etc.) should practice some verbal hygiene on the term \u201cout\u201d and stop using it to describe someone who cross-dresses in public settings that are still anonymous, and who doesn\u2019t disclose their transgenderism to their family, friends, neighbors or co-workers.\u00a0 Of course there\u2019s such a thing as too much information, but there are times when people need to know that we\u2019re transgender. Clearly our next president benefited from the information he got from his professor, and more importantly, from his professor\u2019s own self-acceptance and self-respect.\u00a0 The gay and lesbian communities have benefited from Obama\u2019s acceptance and respect.\u00a0 If transvestites ever hope to be accepted and respected, we have to accept and respect ourselves, and be out of the closet.\u00a0 And this kind of \u201cout\u201d has very little to do with clothes: we can be out to our friends and neighbors without them ever seeing us in a skirt, wig or maid costume.\u00a0 All it takes is these three words, \u201cI\u2019m a transvestite.\u201d\u00a0 Could you say them to Barack Obama?\u00a0 Could you say them, with pride, to a student who might some day be president? Update. August 2009: I just discovered that Steve\u2019s husband died tragically in March.\u00a0 Steve wrote for Americablog about how some of his experiences afterwards highlighted the connection between being out, marriage equality and respect.\u00a0 Last week, he wrote about how it related to his lexicography work.", "feedtitle": "Page 16 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
