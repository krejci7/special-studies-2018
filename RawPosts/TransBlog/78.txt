Those are the best kinds of allies, the ones who do it out of a heartfelt commitment. I call them Righteous People based on three concepts from Jewish philosophy: the Righteous Ones, the Righteous Gentiles and the Righteous Among the Nations.  The Righteous Among the Nations is an honor bestowed on non-Jews who risked \u201clife, liberty or position\u201d to protect Jews during the Nazi holocaust.  It specifically excludes anyone who acted for personal gain. The Righteous Among Nations is said to be based on an earlier notion of the Righteous Gentile, one who is not Jewish but lives among Jews and follows the laws of the community, as shown in the common Hebrew word chasid, which is translated as \u201crighteous,\u201d but also sometimes as \u201cpious.\u201d  This is the same word that is used for Hasidic Jews, people who define themselves by a greater adherence to Jewish law than assimilated European and American Jews. There is another word, tzadik, that is translated as \u201crighteous.\u201d  In the words of Maimonides, \u201cOne whose merit surpasses his iniquity is a tzadik.\u201d  This word comes down to us in the names of Neil Sedaka and Janette Sadik-Khan, who are both apparently descended from Righteous Ones. I mention these distinctions because I think the concepts are also reflected in our concept of \u201cally.\u201d  There is the brother in arms, who is like the Allied Powers, fighting a common enemy.  There is the ally of the hearth, who comes to meetings and parties, and makes an effort to get all the pronouns and terminology right.  They are like the Pious Gentile, the one who is not one of us but lives among us and follows our laws.  Then there are the ones like the employees of the Maryland McDonald\u2019s who tried to defend Chrissy Lee Polis from her attackers, with no motivation but human decency.  Those are the Righteous Ones. The key is that a Pious One is not necessarily a Righteous One.  Just as importantly, a Righteous One is not necessarily a Pious One.  This is why we need to be careful which kind of ally we are talking about when we use the word.", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
