They both relate to my business; in case you don\u2019t know, I\u2019m a computer consultant.  I\u2019ve been hesitant about being out to my customers for a number of reasons.  The main reason is that it\u2019s just not relevant to most of my business.  But sometimes things come up, and it makes sense to mention something trans-related.  The second problem is that I\u2019ve built a lot of my business in my local neighborhood, and it\u2019s a bit more conservative than Manhattan.  Even in Manhattan, though, I worry that transness (especially transvestism) may not be as accepted as homosexuality. There are signs that being out isn\u2019t as difficult as I thought, however.  I know that one of my biggest customers was aware of my cross-dressing before she hired me, and I\u2019ve come out to some of my other cutomers (who I knew were either some flavor of queer, or at least open-minded) with no adverse consequences.  And now, recently, two more things. The first is that I\u2019ve recently become involved in LGBT business networking.  In June I joined the organization Out Professionals, and I was a little apprehensive at first, because all their materials just say \u201clesbian and gay.\u201d  But I asked if it was okay to join because I was trans, and the seminar organizer said, \u201cyou could even be straight, and you\u2019d be welcome.\u201d A few weeks later I got an announcement from Out Professionals that one of their members is organizing a breakfast networking group here in Queens.  I went to the first meeting last month, and it was a really nice experience.  The other attendees were very friendly, and I got some promising business leads.   The next meeting is going to be on Wednesday, September 13 in Jackson Heights.  It\u2019s still at an informal stage, so if anyone reading this is interested in attending, send me an email and I\u2019ll send you the organizer\u2019s email address. The other positive development recently is that I met another computer consultant who\u2019s trans.  This woman is transsexual, around fifteen years post-transition, and has built a successful computer consulting business with several employees.  She tells me she doesn\u2019t pass with everyone and she\u2019s out to anyone who wants to know, but if any of her customers know she\u2019s trans, it doesn\u2019t seem to faze them.  They seem much more interested in getting their computers working. It\u2019s reassuring to see this, as a counterpoint to all those studies that use questionable methods and claim to show that almost all transpeople are drug-addicted prostitutes or underpaid social workers.  It shows that there\u2019s a middle way between the closet and poverty.", "feedtitle": "Page 21 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
