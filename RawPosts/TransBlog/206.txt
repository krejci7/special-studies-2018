Joining Malcolm Gladwell and Jonti Picking is Virginia Postrel, who I just discovered from an article in the October Atlantic Monthly, Superhero Worship. I did a little research to find out more about Postrel, which isn\u2019t very hard since she\u2019s all over the Web.  It\u2019s not like I\u2019m uncovering some hidden gem.  She\u2019s a well-known, well-published writer, editor and blogger on politics and economics.  And honestly, I disagree with most of what I\u2019ve seen from her on those topics.  Hey, I linked to Mike Huben\u2019s Critiques of Libertarianism back in 1995! What I find valuable from Postrel is the clarity that she brings to the idea of glamour.  One fascinating point is the fact that the word \u201cglamor\u201d used to mean a magic spell.  The OED says that it came through the Scots language from the same root as \u201cgrammar,\u201d so the meaning pathway was, roughly, grammar > learning in general > magical skill > magical spell > charming someone with looks and style. So far I haven\u2019t read much more than the Atlantic article, but here are some choice quotes from it: If that sounds crazy, it\u2019s because we tend to forget what glamour is really about. Glamour isn\u2019t beauty or luxury; those are only specific manifestations for specific audiences. Glamour is an imaginative process that creates a specific, emotional response: a sharp mixture of projection, longing, admiration, and aspiration. It evokes an audience\u2019s hopes and dreams and makes them seem attainable, all the while maintaining enough distance to sustain the fantasy. The elements that create glamour are not specific styles \u2013 bias-cut gowns or lacquered furniture \u2013 but more general qualities: grace, mystery, transcendence. To the right audience, Halle Berry is more glamorous commanding the elements as Storm in the X-Men movies than she is walking the red carpet in a designer gown. [\u2026] The superhero fans who wear costumes to comics conventions, buy miniatures of their favorite characters, or line up for artists\u2019 autographs aren\u2019t themselves glamorous. But neither were the Depression-era housewives who bought knockoffs of Joan Crawford\u2019s gowns or wrote fan letters to Gary Cooper. And neither are the InStyle readers who copy Natalie Portman\u2019s latest haircut or wear a version of Halle Berry\u2019s Oscar dress to the prom. But all are acting on glamour\u2019s promise. Glamour is, to quote a fashion blurb, \u201call about transcending the everyday.\u201d The whole point of movie glamour was \u2013 and is \u2013 escape. [\u2026] Still, glamour is always vulnerable to those who love it. The more we\u2019re drawn to a glamorous person, place, or thing, the more we scrutinize it, seeking to fill in the details \u2013 which ultimately destroys the mystery and grace. Someone will always look for the hidden flaws, the seamy side of the story. Hence the demand for gossip about Princess Diana\u2019s bulimia or Jennifer Lopez\u2019s romantic problems. Just in case I need to spell out what blew me away about this article: Postrel absolutely nails the feelings that drive my cross-dressing.  I feel \u201ca sharp mixture of projection, longing, admiration, and aspiration\u201d for attractive women, and I may not be glamorous myself, but like the superhero fans, Depression-era housewives and InStyle readers, there\u2019s a part of me that has longed to escape from the everyday.  It reached a critical point when I started cross-dressing in 1982, but the longing has been with me for years. I love scrutinizing the glamorous to deconstruct their artifice, but as a well-known fictitional practitioner of magic said, \u201cHe that breaks a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom.\u201d In response, you could argue that our ultimate goal is not to find out what it is, but to free ourselves from the spell.  After all, it\u2019s pretty clear that for the Gables and Spearses of the world, achieving glamour doesn\u2019t bring happiness, or even a real escape from whatever our everyday lives are.  So why are we wasting our time longing for something that\u2019s almost by definition not going to bring us fulfilment?  And how can we stop? In that case, the spell is the longing, and the solution is to find out what we\u2019re really longing for.  What do we really feel a need for when we\u2019re envying women with pointy shoes?  What everyday horror are we really trying to escape from?", "feedtitle": "Page 21 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
