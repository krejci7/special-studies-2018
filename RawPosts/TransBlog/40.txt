Often this is ascribed to a difference of essence: some believe they can divide male-to-female trans people into the \u201ctrue transsexuals\u201d who are essentially women with a destiny to transition, and \u201cjust cross-dressers\u201d who are essentially men.  I\u2019m going to focus on the \u201cfeminine spectrum\u201d for this post, but there are similar claims made for female-to-male trans people.  Nobody has yet found a foolproof test for this essence of femininity or masculinity.  What people use instead is a gut feeling: the supposedly real trans women just \u201cfeel like women,\u201d even without making an effort to present as women, while the supposedly fake trans women \u201cfeel like men.\u201d  Many trans people stress these claimed differences.  They argue that non-transitioners who look like \u201cmen in dresses\u201d give true trans women a bad name and claim protections they don\u2019t deserve. My experience has run pretty much counter to those claims.  I have met trans women who transitioned decades ago but \u201cfeel\u201d like men to me, and trans women who have never transitioned but \u201cfeel\u201d like women.  I myself have never transitioned, but when I present as a woman anyone who doesn\u2019t know me but knows I\u2019m trans assumes that I transitioned long ago. If you talk to anyone who believes in this \u201cgut feeling\u201d and show them these counterexamples, they will explain them away with circular reasoning.  A transitioned trans woman who \u201cfeels like a man\u201d is an impostor who should never have transitioned, and people like me are just in denial and will change our minds pretty soon. There is a simpler explanation for this discrepancy between \u201cgut feeling\u201d and reality: there is no essential gender.  But the \u201cgut feeling\u201d is not always wrong.  Where does it come from?  If we examine it, what we find is a more subtle form of passing, one that works even if the observer knows whether the person is trans.  There is no need to assume some inner gender; all the normal passing factors are enough to explain it: Some people just get the luck of the gene draw.  Shorter people with narrower shoulders and mouths, broader hips, smaller hands, feet and brow ridges, and higher voices tend to feel more \u201cnaturally\u201d feminine, while taller people with broader shoulders and mouths, narrower hips, bigger hands, feet and brow ridges, and lower voices tend to feel more \u201cnaturally\u201d masculine. Age plays a huge role. The effects of hormones on secondary sex characteristics don\u2019t stop at puberty.  Trans women who transition early in life will have narrower shoulders and broader hips, while trans women who transition late, or never transition, will have broader shoulders and narrower hips. Body modifications and grooming are as relevant for this \u201cfeeling\u201d as for the better-known forms of passing.  People who have committed to a transition are more likely to get surgery, hair removal and hair transplants.  These treatments are just as artificial as wigs or heavy make-up, but often less noticeable. One of the biggest factors is socialization. Mannerisms are just habits, and habits develop with experience.  Someone who spends a lot of time around women and is treated like a woman will act like the women around them and \u201cfeel\u201d like a woman, and someone who spends a lot of time around men and is treated like a man will act like the men around them and \u201cfeel\u201d like a man.  These effects are cumulative: the more time a person spends living in one gender, the more naturally they interact with others in that gender. Some trans women have pointed out that their socialization was not like typical male socialization. I agree, but I don\u2019t think they were socialized female, either.  There are finer grains of male socialization: we are socialized as girly boys, nerdy boys, gay boys and others. When we get older we can be socialized as gay men.  This means we are given the space, or take the space, to speak and gesture more softly, taking as role models softer men, gay men, or women.  These differences may be felt by some as cues that we are \u201creally\u201d girls or women. There\u2019s another kind of socialization as well: trans socialization.  I know a lot of trans women who socialize primarily with other trans women.  This may be out of choice, or because they\u2019ve been rejected by non-trans people, or because they\u2019re afraid of being rejected or worse.  If a whole bunch of trans women spend most of their time together, they\u2019re going to wind up moving and sounding like each other, and like their ideas of women.  If none of them have any significant female socialization apart from that, then they may not \u201cfeel\u201d like women to other people. Some trans people are just good actors or good mimics, and are able to move and sound like their target gender.  Does that mean that they\u2019re less \u201creal\u201d than other trans people?  Maybe, maybe not.  Sometimes you have to fake it \u2019till you make it.  Some may have a strong desire to sound or move differently from the way they did before.  On the other hand, some may feel uncomfortable with any change in the way they move or sound. Between genes, aging, body modifications, grooming, socialization, alienation and just plain good acting, there are plenty of explanations for why some trans women \u201cfeel\u201d like women, some trans men \u201cfeel\u201d like men, and some don\u2019t.  There is no mystical essence of gender, no \u201cbrain sex\u201d required to explain this.  If you\u2019ve pinned your hopes on the idea of being a \u201cwoman trapped in a man\u2019s body,\u201d you may not like this idea. On the other hand, thinking of this \u201cfeeling\u201d as just another form of passing means that people who have some of these factors going against them may be able to eventually overcome them and \u201cpass by feeling.\u201d  It also means that those of us who have some of the factors in our favor can decide whether or not we want to transition based on what works for us, not whether we \u201cfeel like a woman\u201d to someone else.", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
