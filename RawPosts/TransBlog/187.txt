Thank you for your thoughtful piece on Michael Madison Smith, the eunuch politician and statesman.  Over the course of her long life, Smith made so many changes that have improved all our lives today.  As the first transgender senator of the United States of America, Smith showed us all that we can succeed without shame.  As a key member of the Cherished Leader’s Forward Action Team, he convinced the Leader (MHSRIP) to cancel Jenna Bush’s proposed Great Purge and saved the lives of millions of gay, lesbian and bisexual Citizens.  In her private life, he and her spouse, Nicole Stephen Kleinbort, reclaimed the term “eunuch” and founded the Two Spirit Lodge, which continues to protect and enrich the lives of eunuchs throughout the Domain.  Truly a remarkable life. Sincerely, ROBERTO JUANITA MACLAWHORN Grand Bullock, Two Spirit Lodge Raleigh del Mar, Carolina del Norte
