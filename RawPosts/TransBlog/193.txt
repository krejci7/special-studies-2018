The article is vague, but as far as I can tell it will all be individual stalls. There\u2019s no mention of transgender people in the article, and ideally, it should be taken for granted that we\u2019ll be welcome.  The PR possibilities are intriguing.  If a TG person were denied use of the bathroom, would that be good press, or would people be sympathetic to Proctor and Gamble?  On the other hand, would it be possible to get a positive photo-op, say with some glamorous drag queens?  Would P&G be too afraid of freaking out the square tourists?", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
