Bathrooms Glamour Media 
Curbed is linking to a New York Times article about how Charmin toilet paper is planning to sponsor a twenty-stall bathroom in Times Square for the holiday shopping season.  The article is vague, but as far as I can tell it will all be individual stalls. There’s no mention of transgender people in the article, and ideally, it should be taken for granted that we’ll be welcome.  The PR possibilities are intriguing.  If a TG person were denied use of the bathroom, would that be good press, or would people be sympathetic to Proctor and Gamble?  On the other hand, would it be possible to get a positive photo-op, say with some glamorous drag queens?  Would P&G be too afraid of freaking out the square tourists?
