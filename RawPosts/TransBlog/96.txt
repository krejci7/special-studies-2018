Here, then, is a first attempt at cataloging transgender feelings.  Essentially I\u2019m writing down feelings associated with transgender events or thoughts, or with trans people.  If I\u2019ve written about that feeling before, I\u2019ve tried to link to that post. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, just a starting point.  Please feel free to point out any that you think I\u2019ve missed. I recently wrote that everyone\u2019s actions are non binary in that they cross somebody\u2019s line between men and women.  Trans feelings are similar: as I write down the feelings I\u2019ve felt and heard and read about, I realize how many of my friends and family have had similar feelings.  Not all trans people have all these feelings. It\u2019s important to remember that feelings aren\u2019t always logical.  They\u2019re responses to things that happen to us.  Sometimes they\u2019re rational, and sometimes they aren\u2019t.  That\u2019s okay. A lot of these feelings are superficial.  That\u2019s in part because I\u2019ve focused on specifically transgender feelings, and some of them are superficial.  It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have deeper feelings, it\u2019s just that those feelings are more universal and less trans-specific.  Sometimes I feel sad.  I feel sad that when I\u2019m naked and I look in the mirror I don\u2019t see a beautiful woman.  I feel sad that I don\u2019t always see a beautiful woman when I\u2019m wearing women\u2019s clothes, and sometimes I don\u2019t even see someone who looks like a woman.  I feel sad when I hear women admiring each other\u2019s clothing or grooming, but I\u2019m afraid to tell them about my own women\u2019s clothing or grooming, let alone show them.  I feel sad when I see women being admired, but I don\u2019t see any reason for anyone to admire me. Sometimes I feel frustrated.  I feel frustrated when I spend an hour on my makeup and am told to try on clothes in the men\u2019s changing room.  I feel frustrated when I\u2019m in a room full of women who are attracted to women, and none of them show an interest in me.  I feel frustrated that I have to spend an hour on makeup before I can look in the mirror and see a woman. Sometimes I feel anxious.  I feel anxious about being a man, because men are the dangerous ones.  I feel anxious about being perceived as a man in a dress, because people are rude to men in dresses, and often hurt or even kill us.  I feel anxious about attracting people that I\u2019m not attracted to.  Sometimes I feel anxious about just plain being noticed. Sometimes I feel longing.  I long to be sexy, to be attractive, to be stylish.  I long to be admired, to be loved, to be accepted. Sometimes I feel desire.  I want to be a woman.  I want to wear women\u2019s clothes, to be seen as a woman.  I want to be accepted in women\u2019s roles, with the status of woman.  I want someone to tell me I look pretty, or sexy.  As Rick Nielsen said, I want someone to want me. Sometimes I feel sexually aroused.  I feel aroused when a sexy person desires me.  I feel aroused when I look in the mirror or at a picture of me, and see someone who looks sexy.  I feel aroused when I wear sexy clothes.  I feel aroused when I imagine myself looking sexy. Sometimes I feel excited.  I feel excited about people seeing me as a woman.  I feel excited about people admiring me.  I feel excited about trying on new clothes.  I feel excited about losing weight. Sometimes I feel happy.  I feel happy when my gender presentation looks good.  I feel happy when I get comments on my looks.  I would be very surprised if any of you reading this feel the exact same mix of feelings I do.  That\u2019s normal.  We\u2019re all snowflakes.  There is no one way to be trans.  But from conversations I\u2019ve had and descriptions I\u2019ve read, I know that a lot of you have similar feelings.  Please do let me know if there are feelings you\u2019ve had that I haven\u2019t covered.", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
