We\u2019ve got Country and Western!\u201d  The thing is, I\u2019m not really nonbinary \u2013 at least not in the sense that \u201cmy spirit truly lies somewhere in between,\u201d as B. Scott so eloquently put it. My ideas of \u201cguy\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d are fairly non-traditional: I\u2019m a guy who cries and cooks and earns less than my wife and stays home with the kid. When I want to be a woman, I want to be a smart, thoughtful woman. But I don\u2019t want to be in between.  Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that! It just doesn\u2019t capture how I personally feel about myself. I want to be a guy, except when I want to be a woman. I want to look like a woman, except when I want to look like a guy. Do I look non-binary to you? I\u2019m not genderqueer: my performance of either gender is not intended to provoke or challenge.  I\u2019m not agender.  I\u2019m not a \u201ccloseted trans woman\u201d in ciscritical-not-cisphobic\u2019s attempt to pigeonhole us.  I\u2019m not a member of a \u201cthird sex,\u201d and I don\u2019t want to be.  And no, \u201cgenderfluid\u201d doesn\u2019t work for me, either.  (I\u2019ll say something about that in another post.) I am transgender. I have the same feelings and beliefs as a lot of trans people who have successfully transitioned. There is one difference: I chose not to transition. Trans, but not transitioning. Why can\u2019t they say that?", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
