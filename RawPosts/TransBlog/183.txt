Today I came across mention of the Abb\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois-Timol\u00e9on de Choisy.  This is the first I\u2019ve heard of him (I use the male pronouns because he lived as a man for the later part of his life), but I\u2019ll peruse his Aventures de l\u2019abb\u00e9 de Choisy habill\u00e9 en femme at my leisure and report back here.  Sadly, his later memoirs are not on line, but they may be worth buying to get an idea of what non-transitioning transgender people can do when they get old. One thing that really galls me is that when I searched for reference to Choisy with the word \u201ctransgender,\u201d I came up with a bunch of links that read (emphasis mine): 1676 MTF transsexual Abbe Francois Timoleon de Choisy attended Papal inaugural ball in female dress. His memoirs, published postmortem, offer the first written testimony of cross-dressing. It turns out that these are all copied from a publication by Lambda Legal called \u201cBending the Mold: An Action Kit for Transgender Youth,\u201d with this note at the end: \u201cSpecial thanks for assistance and source materials goes to James Hoagland, T. Aaron Hans, Pauline Park, Kay Brown and Leslie Feinberg.\u201d  On a cursory reading, the information and recommendations in \u201cBending the Mold\u201d seem fairly straightforward and unproblematic.  But it really steams me up that someone would claim as a \u201cMTF transsexual\u201d someone who lived over two hundred years before the word was invented, lived as his birth gender for the last two thirds of his life, and never had any permanent body modifications.  Maybe something in his memoirs will provide some support for an argument that he was a \u201ctrue transsexual\u201d (blech) on some level, but come on.  Way to put the screws on those trans youth, eh? Anyway, rant\u2019s over.  I\u2019ll update you on our friend the abbot once I\u2019ve had a chance to read more.", "feedtitle": "Page 19 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
