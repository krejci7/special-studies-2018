Just to recap:  In July, a transgender person was attacked with a lead pipe in the McDonald\u2019s across from the Empire State Building, by the store manager, for using the bathroom (with permission).  When the police arrived, they arrested the transwoman, not the manager.  The police have told the woman\u2019s lawyer that \u201cthe case is closed,\u201d and as far as I know, McDonald\u2019s has not commented on the matter. The MTA just settled a lawsuit by a Verizon employee stationed at Grand Central Terminal, who was harassed by MTA police whenever she tried to use the women\u2019s room. On October 3, three \u201ctrans youth\u201d (an exonym) were arrested and verbally abused while trying to use the bathrooms in the Port Authority Bus Terminal.  A Port Authority spokesman said, \u201cThe police inspector is very concerned and is looking into it.\u201d Update: this article in the New York Blade provides more details of the verbal abuse that the Port Authority Police laid on these youth, and how State Senator Tom Duane is helping to pressure the Port Authority to comply with the law.  The MTA settlement has been making the news, followed by the blogs, with some predictable responses by clueless bloggers.  Some of the articles are sympathetic, some not.  Here are a few examples:  First, a surprisingly respectful and sensitive article by Clemente Lisi of the New York Post. The Daily News is generally a little more clueful than the Post, so their insensitive take was pretty surprising.  However, it closes with a progressive, open-minded quote. The funniest quote was from a blog called Metadish: \u201cHas anyone actually seen the bathrooms at Grand Central Terminal? This is like a giant step back for the transgendered community. Maybe next time you could lobby for some bathrooms that aren\u2019t public health hazards.\u201d  The other comments all fall into one category, but I\u2019ve got a lot to say about that.  Rather than use \u201cmore\u2026\u201d I\u2019m going to create another post.", "feedtitle": "Page 21 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
