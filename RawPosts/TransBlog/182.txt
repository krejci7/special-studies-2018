I also was listening to some great women singers recently and figured I\u2019d share.  Here are ten women that I like; I\u2019ve picked five that I feel are fairly traditionally \u201cfemme,\u201d and five that are less traditional.  Most of them have sent shivers up my spine at some point or another.  Here are the less traditional ones.  Kate Pierson (The B-52\u2019s).  She\u2019s got an amazingly powerful voice (\u201cRoam\u201d) and works well with Fred Schneider (\u201cGood Stuff\u201d) and Michael Stipe (\u201cMe and Honey\u201d).  She also loves wild clothes and has settled in my hometown.  See also Lady Miss Kier (Deee-Lite). Chrissie Hynde (The Pretenders).  I was a bit put off by her worldliness (\u201cMiddle of the Road\u201d) when I was younger, but she has a good feel for the poignant (\u201cMy City was Gone\u201d, \u201cBack on the Chain Gang\u201d).  See also Terri Nunn (Berlin). Natalie Merchant (10,000 Maniacs).  \u201cLike the Weather\u201d was the first song I heard her on, and it\u2019s an odd song because her voice is so much higher and cheerier-sounding than most of her other work, as she\u2019s singing about being so depressed she can\u2019t get out of bed.  Her \u201cUnplugged\u201d cover of Roxy Music\u2019s \u201cMore than This\u201d is a classic.  See also Dolores O\u2019Riordan (Cranberries). Johnette Napolitano (Concrete Blonde).  Napolitano has seen it all and knows how fucked up it all is (\u201cFree\u201d).  But she can still be romantic (\u201cThe Ship Song\u201d) and tragic (\u201cTomorrow, Wendy\u201d).  See also Amy Ray (\u201cIndigo Girls\u201d). Janis Joplin (Big Brother and the Holding Company).  My parents were big fans of Joplin when they were together, but by the time I was old enough to remember music, they\u2019d both gotten rid of all their albums.  Too bad, she was amazing.  At first I thought all she did was scream, but now I really hear her emotional range (\u201cPiece of My Heart\u201d, \u201cMe and Bobby McGee\u201d).  I also believed all that bullshit about her being ugly.  In the past few years I\u2019ve seen photos and videos of her, and I honestly think she\u2019s one of the most beautiful women from the Sixties.  Honorable mention: Aretha Franklin, Maria Beth\u00e2nia, Monique Powell (Save Ferris), Edith Piaf, Linda Perry (4 Non Blondes), Shirley Bassey, Claire Torry (Pink Floyd), Macy Gray.  Now for the more traditional singers.  Phyllis Dillon, the Queen of Rock Steady.  Such a sweet voice (\u201cDon\u2019t Stay Away\u201d, \u201cPerfidia\u201d). Christine McVie (Fleetwood Mac).  She sang these wonderful songs about sex (\u201cSay You Love Me\u201d, \u201cYou Make Loving Fun\u201d) that really helped me understand a certain kind of female sexuality. Leigh Bingham Nash (Sixpence None the Richer).  So young and innocent (\u201cKiss Me\u201d). Marie Mich\u00e8le Desrosiers (Beau Dommage).  There\u2019s always a lovely poignancy in Desrosiers\u2019 voice (\u201cA toutes les fois\u201d), and she contributes to some of the great group harmonies (\u201cHarmonie du soir \u00e0 Ch\u00e2teauguay\u201d). Harriet Wheeler (The Sundays).  Very English, very languid (\u201cI Kicked a Boy\u201d, \u201cWild Horses\u201d).  Honorable mention: Susanna Hoff, Robin Goldwasser (They Might Be Giants), Rickie Lee Jones, Shania Twain. Since I live most of the time as a man, I should mention some of my favorite male singers as well.  For them, the \u201ctraditional\u201d ones are the good singers, and the non-traditional ones are, well, maybe better at songwriting or performing than singing, but still have interesting voices.  First the great singers:  Jim Morrison (The Doors).  What is it with all these tenors anyway?  Give me a guy with a great baritone (\u201cThe Hyacinth House\u201d, \u201cThe Cars Hiss By My Window\u201d).  See also Brad Roberts (Crash Test Dummies). Levon Helm (The Band).  Anyone who can sing and play drums at the same time (\u201cUp on Cripple Creek\u201d) is pretty impressive, and I\u2019ve always loved Helm\u2019s Arkansas accent (\u201cBlue Moon of Kentucky\u201d).  I\u2019m sorry to read that his voice was damaged by throat cancer.  See also John Fogerty (Creedence Clearwater Revival). Morrissey (The Smiths).  The best part of the Smiths was the contrast between Morrissey and Johnny Marr, but I loved Morrissey\u2019s bombast (\u201cBig Mouth Strikes Again\u201d) and melodrama (\u201cThere is a Light that Never Goes Out\u201d), especially when I was in high school.  See also Robert Smith (The Cure). Paul Simon (Simon and Garfunkel).  I\u2019ve always found Simon\u2019s tentative shyness (\u201c50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\u201d) highly amusing, as I think he intends.  \u201cSomething So Right\u201d is one of my favorite love songs of all time.  See also Steve Winwood (The Spencer Davis Group, Traffic). Randy Travis.  Like Macy Gray, Travis has one of those retro voices, with an amazing texture to it (\u201cForever and Ever, Amen\u201d).  They\u2019ve both also appeared on \u201cBlue\u2019s Clues.\u201d  See also Rick Astley.  Honorable mention: Neil Young (Buffalo Springfield), Bob Marley, Jeff Healey, Ranking Roger (The English Beat), Mick Jagger (The Rolling Stones), Mark Knopfler (Dire Straits), Barry White, Van Morrison, Marshall Crenshaw. Now for some non-traditional male singers, who maybe can\u2019t sing all that well (in contast to both the traditional and non-traditional women), but still have voices that impressed me in some way.  Fred Schneider (The B-52\u2019s).  I\u2019m leading with him as I led with Kate Pierson for the women.  I love his camp, especially the outer-space stuff (\u201cThere\u2019s a Moon in the Sky Called the Moon\u201d), but for sheer silliness nothing beats \u201cQuiche Lorraine.\u201d Serge Gainsbourg.  He had a great voice in the Sixties (\u201cElaeudanla Te\u00eft\u00e9\u00efa\u201d), and smoked too many Gitanes, so by the end of his career he mostly spoke his lines, and relied on backup singers to hold the melody (\u201cSorry Angel\u201d).    See also Leonard Cohen.  Warren Zevon.  Now there\u2019s a guy with a gravelly voice (\u201cLawyers, Guns and Money\u201d); at one point in the Hindu Love Gods version of \u201cVigilante Man\u201d it sounds like he\u2019s hacking up a hairball.  See also Jeff Healey. Elvis Costello.  Nobody does wounded accusation like Elvis Costello (\u201cBusy Bodies\u201d, \u201cTwo Little Hitlers\u201d)  You\u2019ve hurt him, and he\u2019s going to let you know just how much.  See also Gordon Gano (Violent Femmes). Shock G/Humpty Hump (Digital Underground).  His voice has so much body and resonance (\u201cPacket Man\u201d, \u201cKiss Me and I\u2019ll Kiss You Back\u201d).  He\u2019s also hilarious.  Honorable Mention: David Byrne, Michael Stipe, Shaggy, Lou Reed, Tom Petty. Now, wasn\u2019t that self-indulgent?  Hey, if I\u2019ve got a blog, I might as well use it to bore you all with my musical tastes.  After all, it beats working.", "feedtitle": "Page 19 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
