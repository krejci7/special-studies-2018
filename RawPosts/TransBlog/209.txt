I\u2019ll also write new articles as the muse strikes me.  Many of them will relate to this list of principles that I developed in 2005 and have been expanding since. For the past two and a half years I\u2019ve been participating on the (en)gender Message Boards, moderated by Helen Boyd, author of My Husband Betty, and her husband Betty Crow.  It\u2019s a really good group of people, with lots of interesting ideas about transgender phenomena, but over that time I\u2019ve found myself saying a few things over and over again.  This page is written in part to save myself some typing on this message board; the next time one of these comes up I can just link to Principle 3.  Kind of like the joke about the comedians\u2019 club. Right now I\u2019ll just write a little blurb for each principle.  As time goes on I may expand them into full-fledged articles.  1. No one really knows what\u2019s going on  Discussions about transgenderism are often full of generalizations: \u201cTransgender individuals are like this,\u201d or \u201cTranssexuals are like this, but cross-dressers are like that.\u201d  The fact of the matter is that nobody\u2019s done enough research to prove this, so everyone\u2019s going on hunches.  Unfortunately, hunches can often be wrong.  The bottom line is that nobody has information beyond the people that they\u2019ve talked to.  Except in Sweden.  2. Sometimes it is sexual  Lots of TG people bend over backwards to say \u201cHey, we\u2019re not perverts!  It\u2019s not sexual for us!  We\u2019re really women inside!\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019re expressing our feminine sides!\u201d  And maybe it\u2019s true for them. But it\u2019s not true for everyone.  For me, personally, it\u2019s sexual. That\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s exclusively sexual, or that cross-dressing is the equivalent of having sex.  It\u2019s just saying that it\u2019s sexual.   3. Beware of gender euphoria  Cross-dressing can be exciting in many ways, but there\u2019s a certain kind of excitement that comes from cross-dressing in public. Something about having normal interactions with other people while presenting as the target gender can really make a transgendered person feel good.  The problem is that sometimes it can feel too good, so good that you want more.  TG people can get really carried away like this, and wind up doing things that they regret, like irreversable body modifications, or wrecking their relationships.   4. There are degrees of transvestite sexuality  This is kind of a follow-up to Principle 2.  Right after I admitted to myself that my cross-dressing was sexual, I felt bad about going out in public cross-dressed.  Then I realized that people are sexual in public all the time, and it\u2019s not considered a bad thing, at least in certain parts of the country.  People flirt, hold hands, kiss and cuddle in public.  When I go out cross-dressed in public, the sexual aspect never gets more intense than that.   5. There is no one way to be transgendered  I have Jamison Green  to thank for this one.  It\u2019s also been paraphrased by Helen Boyd as \u201cThere\u2019s no right way to be trans.  There\u2019s no wrong way to be trans.\u201d  This is obviously related to Principle 1, but slightly different. Unfortunately, it\u2019s all too common in the transgender community to hear statements invalidating one person\u2019s transgender experience and suggesting that \u201creal\u201d transgenders do such-and-such.  To quote another transgender thinker, Flawless Sabrina, \u201cWe\u2019re like snowflakes.\u201d   6. Going out is not the same as being out  Recently there\u2019s been a movement of cross-dressers to go out in public, usually shopping or to bars, and say that they\u2019re \u201cout of the closet.\u201d  While it does involve revealing transgender status to at least some people, this concept of \u201cout\u201d is very different from the one used in the gay and lesbian communities, where it was borrowed from.  A gay man who holds hands with his lover while walking through Chelsea, but then tells his family, co-workers and neighbors that they\u2019re \u201cjust friends\u201d would not be considered out of the closet, and I don\u2019t consider a cross-dresser who is only seen cross-dressed anonymously or in trans-safe spaces to be out of the closet.  The value of being out is to bring awareness of our humanity to those outside of our community: to show them that cross-dressers aren\u2019t just freaks on Maury Povich, but friends, brothers, neighbors and co-workers.  Being seen as a random cross-dressed stranger on the street, in a store, or in a bar does very little for that kind of awareness.  If you\u2019re not up to it, that\u2019s fine; just don\u2019t call yourself \u201cout,\u201d or you\u2019ll piss me off.   7. Don\u2019t judge the normal by the standards of the exceptional Just about anyone who\u2019s had contact with the trans community has had the experience of meeting someone who\u2019s a \u201cgreat pass.\u201d  Often there\u2019s the idea that this person must \u201creally\u201d be a woman because she seems so feminine.  And maybe it\u2019s true for some people.  But often what they\u2019re perceiving is really physical characteristics (body size or shape, facial features, high voice), or skill (good actors, good mimics, good dancers, good with make-up).  And I think people wind up judging normal transpeople by the standards of these exceptional people, and believing that these normal people aren\u2019t \u201creally trans\u201d because they don\u2019t pass as well.   8. Experimentation changes you  I\u2019ve often wanted to explore female roles, by interacting with supportive friends and my wife, and by going out in public, while presenting as a woman.  I figured it was a good way for me to figure out how far I wanted to go with things, and what kinds of things I wanted or didn\u2019t want to do.  The problem is that the act of exploration and experimentation changes you.  Going out in public, going on dates, taking voice lessons, putting together a presentable wardrobe in addition to my fantasy one \u2013 all of those things changed who I was and how I related to myself, to gender and to other people. Some things I haven\u2019t been able to go back on, some things have set me off in unexpected directions.  Some of it works through gender euphoria, some of it through other mechanisms that I don\u2019t understand. It hasn\u2019t all been bad, but it hasn\u2019t necessarily been good.  So if you want to experiment, try to anticipate the consequences of experimenting.", "feedtitle": "Page 21 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
