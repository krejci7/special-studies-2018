I\u2019ve focused on people who grew up as boys and feel a desire to be women, but I hope that some of what I wrote is helpful for people who grew up as girls and feel a desire to be men or nonbinary.  You can read the first installment here.  I have already written the entire article in long form, if you want to read the whole thing right away. Here, as promised, are a few strategies that I have developed over the years to keep myself relatively stable.  I can\u2019t say they\u2019ve worked completely for me: I\u2019m further down the slope than I\u2019d like to be.  I can\u2019t promise they\u2019ll work for you, but I hope some of you will find them useful.  Don\u2019t repress yourself.  You\u2019ll just resent it, and then wind up rebelling.  Only take the following steps if you agree with the reasoning behind them.  Do not deny yourself feminine expression without a good reason \u2013 like the following reasons. Invest in your masculine identity.  This is who you chose to be for the rest of your life.  You might as well get comfortable.  When you think about the future, make sure you spend most of your time thinking about your future as a man. Don\u2019t invest too much in your feminine identity.  If you\u2019re serious about not becoming a woman, don\u2019t act like you\u2019re planning to be one.  Don\u2019t spend too much money or time or energy on your life as a woman, because you\u2019ve already decided that it\u2019s a dead end.  Don\u2019t get in the habit of doing things that you can only do as a woman, or make friends who only know you as a woman. Spread out your significant gender events.  This may well be the most important strategy.  In my experience, the excitement of anticipation can last for up to a week before the event, and the gratification phase can last for up to two weeks after.  That\u2019s three weeks of gender fog.  I tried scheduling my events at least a month apart, but that left only one week out of four that I wasn\u2019t in some kind of fog.  I\u2019ve changed it to six weeks minimum, and that feels much better.", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
