Marshall makes some reasonable points about the movie, while criticizing the essential device driving the plot: the villain, Buffalo Bill, murders women for \u201cwomen suits\u201d in an effort to satisfy his transgender desire.  Truitt acknowledges and expands on Marshall\u2019s critique, but then takes an unexpected turn, talking about beginning to \u201creclaim\u201d the character of Buffalo Bill and questioning Marshall\u2019s claim that the heroine of the book, Clarice Starling, \u201cis, simply, good.\u201d AntBreach is baffled by this.  He reiterates the claim made by Hannibal Lecter in Thomas Harris\u2019s original novel (and the film) that \u201cBilly\u2019s not a transsexual,\u201d a claim repeated by Marshall.  He then wonders, \u201cIf you want to reduce stigma against trans people, why would you insist one of cinema\u2019s most gruesome horror villains was trans all along?\u201d At this point I have to make a confession: I have never watched the entire Silence of the Lambs.  Shortly after it came out, when I was still in the closet, I was invited to join some friends who were watching it on video, but after the first half hour or so when I figured out it was going to be an unrealistic fantasy about transgender actions, I made some excuses and left.  I don\u2019t care if you like the cinematography or the storytelling or the acting or any of that.  I\u2019ve never liked horror movies, and on top of that I have very little patience for hateful fiction that distorts and belittles my experience or that of my people.  So fuck The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, fuck Deliverance, and fuck Silence of the Lambs. Because I haven\u2019t seen the movie or read the book, I\u2019m basing this post on what other people have written.  If you think any of my source information is incorrect, feel free to let me know. The answer to AntBreach\u2019s question is that Lecter never said Buffalo Bill wasn\u2019t trans.  He said that Bill wasn\u2019t a transsexual \u2013 and if he wasn\u2019t a transsexual, he was a transvestite.  As Truitt points out, this is the same gatekeeping technique \u2013 sheep go to heaven, goats go to hell \u2013 developed by Harry Benjamin and practiced by the medical establishment for over fifty years.  It is contemptuous and inhuman whether it is coming from Hannibal Lecter, or Ray Blanchard, or Clarice Starling. As a transvestite myself, I am not at all comforted by the idea that Buffalo Bill wasn\u2019t a transsexual.  Transphobia isn\u2019t the hatred of transsexuals, it\u2019s the hatred of all of us.  Marshall makes this core point by saying that Lecter\u2019s statement \u201cdoesn\u2019t change the fact that Buffalo Bill is depicted as a character whose queerness is inextricably bound up in murderous desire.\u201d  I wish that Marshall had also accepted that Buffalo Bill was trans, not just some unspecified form of queer. But I\u2019m pretty sure that Marshall is not a transvestite, and neither are Truitt or AntBreach, or for that matter Harris or director Jonathan Demme, or Lecter, or Starling, or Benjamin or Blanchard.  And this gets to the problem that I have with so many of these articles: people who aren\u2019t transvestites pontificating on who we are, what we feel, and what we do and why \u2013 or even using us as an insult to demean each other.  Even Truitt\u2019s article is problematic in this regard, reproducing essentialist narratives of gender. This discussion raised other questions: is that really the way to deal with stigma?  What should trans people do about all these horror movies?  I\u2019ll tackle them in future posts. In the meantime, do me a favor: next time you\u2019re tempted to write something about transvestites, try to talk to at least one transvestite and find out what we think.  You can ask me, but I\u2019m not the only one out there.  And no, transitioned trans people don\u2019t count.  If you think you don\u2019t know any transvestites, think about how many writers thought they didn\u2019t know any gay men or lesbians fifty years ago.", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
