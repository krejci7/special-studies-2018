You\u2019ll even find plenty of arguments that it\u2019s wrong to try to pass, or to use the word \u201cpass,\u201d because it\u2019s connected with racist ideas of \u201cpassing for white,\u201d or because it implies that trans people are not the gender they claim to be, reinforcing the \u201cdeceiver\u201d stereotype and undermining the essentialist \u201ctrans women are women\u201d ideology. I get where a lot of this is coming from, and I\u2019m sympathetic to it.  I agree that the old culture of passing was fraught with misogyny and conformism, and that the \u201cdeceiver\u201d stereotype has been part of a system of violent exploitation of trans people.  I also agree that some people have a harder time passing than others, and that that doesn\u2019t necessarily make them any less trans.  I don\u2019t think it would be the worst thing in the world if trans women were seen by the general public as a special kind of women instead of as \u201cmen in dresses.\u201d  And people who transition need to do whatever they can to make peace with their new lives. I have several problems with this line of thinking, however.  One major problem is that trans people, particularly those of us on the feminine spectrum, regularly face harassment and discrimination.  Passing, particularly superficial passing on the street, can prevent a lot of that.  Just last weekend I went out shopping.  I think at some point my makeup must have gotten smudged, because I started getting funny looks from people on the street.  Nobody said anything, but I imagine that I would have gotten more extreme looks, and maybe comments, if I\u2019d gone out in a dress with no makeup at all on.  Passing makes a difference to our safety.  It\u2019s fine for people to take calculated risks to show confidence in public, but it\u2019s not fair to expect everyone to do that. Some of the trans men I\u2019ve talked to say that the safety issue is different for them, although no less important.  They don\u2019t get targeted so much for being seen as deceivers, but for being seen as women, and sometimes as lesbians.  If they think they pass, they may go to places where they would hesitate to go as women, but where they feel relatively safe as men.  Not passing exposes them as women, and thus as potential prey. Another issue is that for many of us, our presentation is a skill, something we\u2019ve worked at for years, an art or a craft.  It takes time and effort to get it right, every time.  We deserve to be proud of our work and to be appreciated for it. Here\u2019s one of my biggest problems with these anti-passing arguments: I didn\u2019t start wearing women\u2019s clothes because I wanted to be a trans woman.  I wanted to be a woman.  Not just any woman, but a pretty, sexy woman.  (Give me a break, I was twelve years old.)  I know full well that there are plenty of women who are admired and respected for being smart, thoughtful and caring, but those are things I can do as a guy.  What\u2019s the point of being a woman if I can\u2019t be pretty or sexy? I also know that it\u2019s possible to be seen as a sexy, pretty trans woman.  I\u2019m open to that, but it\u2019s not what I want when I feel my trans desire.  The desire is to be a woman, and that means the kind of women I envied when I was a teenager: women who were not noticeably trans. And yes, I know that many other trans women have made peace with the idea of being seen as trans, or not being seen as pretty or sexy.  I say good for them, and I say that without sarcasm.  But many of them have transitioned, and it makes much more sense to give up on that kind of desire when you\u2019ve decided to live as a woman full-time for the rest of your life.  Many of them are also older, and when I get older I will eventually make peace with not being sexy, but not yet. So yes, it\u2019s great to challenge the deceiver stereotype, and the pressure to pass, and the toxic culture of \u201cpassing tips.\u201d  But it\u2019s also okay to want to be safe, to be pretty, to be sexy, and to be proud of our work.", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
