First of all, I\u2019ve read WorldNetDaily before, and I\u2019m aware it\u2019s not exactly the pinnacle of journalistic ethics and style, but still, if you\u2019ve read the Daily News and New York Post articles I\u2019ve linked to in previous posts, it\u2019s obvious that the quotes are all taken from one or the other of the articles.\u00a0 Yet the WorldNetDaily article gives these newspapers absolutely no credit for the work they did of interviewing Helena Stone and the three \u201cwoman-on-the-street\u201d subjects, not even a link.\u00a0 That\u2019s called plagiarism, and it would earn a failing grade if any of my students turned it in. Second, to expand on the point made by the Good As You blogger, I\u2019ve been in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s bathrooms in Grand Central Station.\u00a0 My memory\u2019s a little hazy, but I\u2019m pretty sure that, unlike some public bathrooms (Rockefeller Center, for example), the partitions between toilet stalls are floor-to-ceiling.\u00a0 The fact that these particular bathrooms have been a focus of paranoia is especially bizarre given that they actually have more privacy than your average bathroom.\u00a0 They also tend to be well-trafficked at all hours of the day and night. I do have to give the WorldNetDaily \u201cexclusive commentator\u201d credit for giving background on the harassment that Stone experienced at the hands of the MTA Police, so that the idea of sensitivity training doesn\u2019t seem like some knee-jerk liberal response.", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
