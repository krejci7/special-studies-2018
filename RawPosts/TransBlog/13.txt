But there are many trans people out there who are still figuring things out, and looking for advice.  This is for them, and for anyone who might be in a position of advising them. I wrote years ago that we can divide trans people into five groups.  One group would commit suicide if they didn\u2019t transition, another would commit suicide if they did transition.  There are people who might not commit suicide if they didn\u2019t transition, but they\u2019d still be pretty miserable, and people who would be miserable if they did transition.  Then there are people who could make it work either way.  I would put myself in the \u201ctransition optional\u201d group, and I\u2019ve argued before that it\u2019s probably the biggest group.  Note that this grouping is not meant to indicate some essential or immutable qualities.  They are states of mind, and people can and do shift from one state to another based on the circumstances in their lives. There\u2019s something that I think needs to be said, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever said it before: If you don\u2019t have to transition, it\u2019s not a good idea to transition.  Medical procedures (hormones and surgery) will disrupt the functions of your body and leave it more vulnerable to biological and social challenges. Being visibly trans invites harassment and discrimination.  The process of transition can alienate friends and family.  These social factors may not be fair, but they are there. Some of you might be thinking, \u201cwell, yeah, that\u2019s obvious,\u201d but there are a surprising number of people who act as though transition is always a good idea.  Zinnia Jones famously created a site called \u201cShould I Transition?\u201d with one word on the page, \u201cYes,\u201d indicating that if you\u2019re asking the question then your destiny is to transition.  For people like this there are no possible downsides and no false positives.  And if any of them have read this far, they\u2019ve probably marked me down already as an Enemy of Trans People for suggesting it. So let me put my position out there: Should you transition? Only if you would be miserable otherwise.", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
