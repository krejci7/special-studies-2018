This is a bad thing, and I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if it were intentional on the part of Drudge and FreeRepublic.  I think I\u2019m going to have to dissect the article to show just how badly it portrayed the issue: The line for the girls\u2019 room just got longer. If it did at all, it probably wasn\u2019t to the extent that anyone would notice.  But it\u2019s a cute lead-in, and was taken as a serious point by many bloggers, who were apparently unaware of the Bathroom Parity law passed last year. Men who live as women can now legally use women\u2019s rest rooms in New York\u2019s transit system under an unprecedented deal revealed yesterday. They already could.  The deal just ensures that the MTA Police (who patrol Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road stations, not the subway) will commit to following the law. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority agreed to allow riders to use MTA rest rooms \u201cconsistent with their gender expression,\u201d the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund announced yesterday. The group filed a complaint against the MTA on behalf of a 70-year-old telephone repair technician who was arrested for using the women\u2019s room at Grand Central Terminal. The technician, who is assigned to the terminal by Verizon, was born Henry McGuinness but now goes by Helena Stone. \u201cI\u2019m a 24-hour woman,\u201d Stone declared proudly. \u201cI just feel like a woman and I like to wear women\u2019s clothes.\u201d The MTA would not comment on the settlement but Stone\u2019s lawyer said it also includes mandatory transgender sensitivity training for MTA employees and a $2,000 payment to the technician for legal fees. Just the mention of \u201csensitivity training\u201d pissed off a lot of the right-wing bloggers.  Note that Donohue didn\u2019t mention the extent of the harassment Stone endured at the hands of the MTA Police, which was described by Lisi.  Some of the bloggers might have understood the point of the training if they\u2019d read about Stone being repeatedly arrested, insulted and searched. Michael Sullivan, Stone\u2019s lawyer, called the settlement of the complaint with the Human Rights Commission a \u201cmilestone\u201d toward recognition of the city law that prohibits discrimination against transgender men and women. Stone\u2019s lawyer is named Michael Silverman.  But a fake name may make it more difficult for vigilante Freepers to harass him. But some Metro-North riders at Grand Central yesterday were stunned by the ruling. \u201cI would not like that,\u201d said Gloria David, a retiree from Connecticut. \u201cI have nothing against gay men or drag queens, but they can use the men\u2019s room. I just don\u2019t want to go to the bathroom next to a man.\u201d Presumably Donohue knows that most of the people using the women\u2019s room under the new law are not gay men or drag queens, but he doesn\u2019t use the opportunity to point out David\u2019s misconception. One rider feared predators might dress as women and lurk in the women\u2019s room. I addressed this point in detail in an earlier post. But Rena Gantz, 23, a college student, shrugged off the settlement. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me because it is a reality,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they believe they are women, they should be treated as one.\u201d Interestingly, the one sensitive quote in the article was often left off of many of the reprintings by blogs.", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
