That didn\u2019t really prepare them for the reality of going through life as a short guy.  Similarly, nothing prepared me for the reality of being a tall, overweight woman, for the pain of walking in heels and the discomfort of the male gaze. When I posted about my trans feelings back in January, one response was that I didn\u2019t sound like a woman, that the feelings I wrote about don\u2019t support any claims to \u201cinteriority,\u201d and that I have an \u201coutsider perspective.\u201d  The commenter assumed that I would claim this interiority because I identified as a trans woman, but the point of my post was that I don\u2019t claim any kind of interior femininity.  I do have occasional flashes of \u201cinsider perspective\u201d on a woman\u2019s life, but they come from the limited time I\u2019ve spent in women\u2019s roles, not from some essential \u201cinteriority.\u201d I\u2019ve observed the same thing in other trans people.  The degree of understanding I see in other trans women is proportional to the amount of real experience they have living in the world as women and interacting with others as women.  And no, experience in support groups and \u201ctrans women only\u201d spaces doesn\u2019t count.  I\u2019ve never seen any evidence to support claims of inner femininity. Maybe you say that I don\u2019t see their inner femininity because I\u2019m \u201creally a man.\u201d  But think about the transmasculine friends I mentioned above.  You can\u2019t get much more of an outsider perspective than not knowing how short men are treated.  If you believe that these trans men have always been \u201creally men\u201d too, why didn\u2019t they know? Not only do many trans people persist in claiming interior femininity (or masculinity), but many are willing to accept those claims \u2013 or even to claim them on behalf of other people.  Not long ago a trans man told me that I was so obviously feminine that I should be making plans to transition.  It wasn\u2019t the first time people have told me that I should transition, or assumed that I\u2019d already transitioned, or even assumed that I was born and raised a woman.  Some have even assumed I was a trans man.  None of them were right.  People are bad judges of this stuff. Even if you believe that trans women are and have always been women, and that trans men are and have always been men, you should be able to accept that many aspects of masculinity and femininity are cultural, and that knowledge of these aspects is very difficult to acquire without direct experience.  Trans men who haven\u2019t lived as men will have an outsider perspective on many aspects of masculinity, and trans women who have never lived as women will have an outsider perspective on many aspects of femininity.", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
