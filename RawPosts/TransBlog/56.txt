For years I thought it had nothing to do with me, that any resemblance was purely coincidental.  Now I\u2019m convinced that the movie, and the play that it\u2019s based on, is an insightful examination of transgender feelings and actions. I don\u2019t remember if I had already started sneaking into my sister\u2019s room to try on her neglected pantyhose and dresses, or if I had only fantasized about being a pretty girl in makeup and heels.  Either way, it was around the time I turned twelve that my sister told us about a movie she\u2019d gone to see with a friend.  They had shouted and thrown toilet paper at the screen!  It was a wacky movie with singing, dancing and a transvestite! What was a transvestite?  It was a man who dressed up in women\u2019s clothes, they said.  Kind of like the actor my dad told me about \u2013 or even like me!  Was this person pretty, or even sexy?  I was curious, but when I tried to find out more it was all about the Frankenstein Place and the Galaxy of Transylvania and people named Meat Loaf and Columbia.  The soundtrack that my sister started playing didn\u2019t help me at all. Finally, we visited some friends of the family who had a weird book adaptation, illustrated with copious stills from the movie, like one of those Tumblr gif sets except the pictures didn\u2019t move.  I snuck off and perused it, eager to see what a transvestite looked like. I honestly didn\u2019t know what to make of the character of Dr. Frank N. Furter, the mad scientist.  He didn\u2019t pad his breasts, his makeup looked like clown makeup, and what did he have on his legs? Was he wearing some kind of shorts over his tights? Eventually I learned about fishnets and garter belts, and then I figured out what I was seeing.  But I still didn\u2019t find Dr. Frank remotely sexy, let alone pretty.  I filed the Rocky Horror Picture Show under Weird Cross-dressing Things I Can\u2019t Relate To.  This file went in the drawer with the file of Weird Relationship Things I Can\u2019t Relate To, and Weird Political Things I Can\u2019t Relate To. Like a bunch of things in that drawer, several years later I had a chance to take Rocky Horror out of the file and examine it.  And several years after that I took it out again, and now it doesn\u2019t seem so foreign to me.  I\u2019ll talk more about that in future posts.", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
