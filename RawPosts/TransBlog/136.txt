She said that it\u2019s basic Internet etiquette to ask before using someone\u2019s tweets in a blog post, and that I damaged her ability to trust other trans people who reach out to her for help. Apparently she was under the impression I was asking for advice, not support. I honestly had no idea that some people followed this rule, and no intention of misleading her or abusing her trust. As soon as Reed complained to me I apologized and removed the references to her from this post.  She ignored that and spent an hour subtweeting her misunderstandings about my intentions.  After several months with no response, I am restoring the references to her statements.) The gist of this argument is that even if you\u2019re not one of the \u201ctransition or die\u201d trans people, if you don\u2019t transition now you\u2019ll eventually find yourself in that category.\u00a0 There\u2019s also an idea (which I generally agree with) that if you\u2019re going to transition the earlier the better.\u00a0 Put the two together, and you get an argument that every trans person should transition as soon as possible. (I\u2019m still not sure how you get from there to \u201canyone who doesn\u2019t want to transition must not be trans,\u201d but we can deal with that at some other point.) For some people, feelings of gender discomfort and the desire to be the other gender definitely do get stronger over time.\u00a0 I\u2019ve heard this from many trans people, and I don\u2019t want to discount their experiences.\u00a0 But it\u2019s not necessarily true, and it\u2019s not automatically true. Again we come back to the principle that no one really knows what\u2019s going on with trans people, and no one will know until we get some kind of representative sample.\u00a0 Generalizations with \u201call\u201d and \u201calways\u201d are simply not appropriate. I personally find that my discomfort with being a man, and my desire to be a woman, are not even perfectly correlated with each other, much less constant over time.\u00a0 They both have their ups and downs, and I can connect some of those ups and downs to particular circumstances in my life, but not all of them.\u00a0 Reed is right in that they both keep coming back, even after thirty years or so, but she\u2019s wrong in that on average they haven\u2019t gotten more intense or more frequent. This is again the problem of negative evidence: we can see that for some trans people it gets harder over time, but we don\u2019t necessarily notice that for other people it doesn\u2019t get harder.\u00a0 For every person who transitions or commits suicide, or even hangs on in quiet desperation, there may be one, or many, who lead relatively happy lives without transitioning, until they die.\u00a0 We just don\u2019t know. What we do know is that there are some people like me, for whom it hasn\u2019t gotten harder.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the thing about generalizations: they can be invalidated by even one counterexample.", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
