It\u2019s an age-old expression of power: the right to decide which categories people get put in, who belongs and who doesn\u2019t, who is condemned and who is spared, who is mocked and who is praised. These arguments are compounded by the problems that we humans have in categorizing anything in a way that we can agree on.  Last week I had a chance to talk with George Lakoff, who has done a lot to raise awareness of the problems with traditional definitions of categories, and he agreed that these problems have a greater impact when it comes to categorizing people. Because of this, I generally try to avoid talking about transgender people, and instead focus on trans feelings, beliefs and actions.  Unfortunately, the rest of the trans world hasn\u2019t seen the value in this, and keeps arguing about how to categorize people.  One of the worst things people do is to apply their categories uncritically to people from other cultures at other times, without their approval or consent. This came up a few days ago when someone called Nat tweeted this:  The Stonewall Riots were 44 years ago today. Let's all remember they were started by trans women of colour, not rich white dudes in suits. \u2014 TheNatFantastic (@TheNatFantastic) June 28, 2013  As Nat explained to me, the target of this tweet was the organization Stonewall UK, which is apparently run by a bunch of rich white dudes in suits.  I agree that it\u2019s problematic for an organization called Stonewall to be run by people who don\u2019t look anything like the people who started the Stonewall Riots, but I objected to Nat\u2019s use of \u201ctrans women\u201d to describe the actual rioters. The people who started the Stonewall Riots did not call themselves \u201ctrans women of color.\u201d  \u201cTrans women\u201d is a recent coinage, from the past ten years, and \u201cof color\u201d is only slightly older.  If they wanted to categorize themselves by race they were \u201cblack\u201d (maybe \u201cNegro\u201d) and \u201cPuerto Rican,\u201d and if they categorized themselves by gender expression they were \u201ctransvestites\u201d and \u201cqueens.\u201d  After the riots, the organization that Sylvia Rivera founded was called the Street Transvestites Action Network.  (She later changed it to Street Transgender Action Network, but never to anything containing the term \u201ctrans women.\u201d) Rioters at the Stonewall Inn, 1969.The problem with referring to the Stonewall activists as \u201ctrans women\u201d is that that category is reserved for transitioners.  Some of the Stonewall veterans had partly transitioned, and some transitioned later (including Rivera), but many lived part time and never transitioned.  Would they transition if they were in their teens and twenties today?  Maybe, maybe not. Nat tweeted to me, \u201cI was under the impression that trans* included -vestite?\u201d  Yes, trans* includes -vestite. \u201cTrans woman\u201d does not \u2013 except when they\u2019re co-opting us to get money or political support. When have you ever heard \u201ctrans woman\u201d used to describe someone who\u2019s not transitioning?  RuPaul has been explicitly excluded from the category \u2013 and apart from being wealthy she probably bears the greatest resemblance to the Stonewall rioters of any celebrity today.  If you can find a non-transitioner in any list of contemporary \u201ctrans women,\u201d I\u2019d love to see it.  I\u2019ve never seen Eddie Izzard or Rye Silverman in one.  And in the few tweets I\u2019ve read from @theNatFantastic, I\u2019ve never seen a contemporary non-transitioner as a trans woman. So no, you don\u2019t get to go around talking about \u201ctrans women\u201d never mentioning a non-transitioner, and then turn around and claim non-transitioning heroes as \u201ctrans women.\u201d  The Stonewall rioters were not trans women.  They were transvestites.  They\u2019re my heroes, not yours. Here\u2019s the kicker, which prompted Nat to tell me to \u201cchill the fuck out\u201d: there is a systematic exclusion of non-transitioners from the \u201ctrans community,\u201d and \u201ctrans women\u201d leaders are actively involved in this exclusion.  \u201cTrans women\u201d are doing exactly the same thing as Nat\u2019s \u201crich white dudes in suits.\u201d  Nat\u2019s tweet was part of this exclusion. Maybe it\u2019s because I sometimes look like a white dude in a suit, but I\u2019ve found a lot more acceptance and support from rich white dudes in suits than I ever have from \u201ctrans women,\u201d many of whom are rich and white and wear suits. Let\u2019s all remember that the Stonewall Riots were started by Black and Puerto Rican transvestites.  Their legacy belongs to the world, but more to Black people, Puerto Ricans and transvestites than to the rest of us.  And most of all to Black and Puerto Rican transvestites, who still flock to Greenwich Village to this day.  Maybe we should let them decide what to do with it.", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
