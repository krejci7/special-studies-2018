I want to be a happy trans.  I don\u2019t like being negative, and I don\u2019t like singling out people.  I\u2019ve held back for years.  Unfortunately, people keep putting in hours, months, years of work producing these bad statistics, and then advocating questionable policies based on them.  This latest one could be really damaging.  It\u2019s about trans regret, and it comes from a British grad student named Maeve Regan: The recent Trans Mental Health Study was the largest study of its kind ever undertaken in Europe, with almost 900 respondents. The study asked specifically about individuals\u2019 feelings of regret following social and/or medical transition. These are the results: In terms of social changes made during transition (coming out to friends and family, changing name, living full or part time in a gender not assigned at birth), 34% of respondents had minimal regrets and 9% had significant regrets. A small majority, 53% had no regrets. Specific regrets given included: not having the body they had wanted from birth, not transitioning earlier, losing friends and family, and the impact of transition on others. In terms of physical changes made during transition (resulting from hormone therapy and surgical interventions), the vast majority, 86%, had no regrets. Of the remainder, 10% had minor regrets and 2% had major regrets. The specific regrets given include complications relating to surgery (especially loss of sensitivity), and the choice of surgeon (if surgery resulted in complications or required revisions and repairs). Regan, who identifies herself as \u201ccisgendered (not trans),\u201d wrote the above as part of a summary of findings of the Trans Mental Health Study, for which she was \u201cpart of the Advisory Board.\u201d  [Edited to add]: She concludes, \u201cIt is clear from the actual reported regrets, along with the conclusions that transition is associated with a broad range of positive indicators, that most cases of regret around transition are not related to being a different gender to the one assigned at birth, or undergoing transition, but rather due to poor surgical outcomes, social stigma and huge barriers to medical care.\u201d In other words, trans people never regret transitioning.  We only regret the way we\u2019re treated, or the way the surgery turns out. This statistic was used in an online discussion where I brought up trans regret.  [Edited]: One of Regan\u2019s co-authors, Jay McNeil, wrote, \u201cwe found that where people did have regrets, they were largely related to their experiences of how they were treated rather than the choices they\u2019d made around their bodies. Where people felt like de-transitioning it was mainly because they lacked support to cope wit the social stigma and losses.\u201d How are these percentages bad statistics?  They are taken from a non-representative sample and generalized to all transgender people in the United Kingdom.  Specifically, this survey was collected using the ubiquitous \u201csnowball\u201d method: Participants were encouraged to take part mainly through a process of snowballing. Trans support groups, online forums and mailing lists with UK members were contacted and given information about the study and asked to share the survey as widely as possible. Other equality and health groups, and professional networks with potential links to the trans population (e.g. LGBT networks; professionals whose work might bring them into contact with trans people) were also contacted and asked to distribute information about the survey. The survey spread primarily through word-of-mouth, and the researchers attended a number of trans groups in person to discuss the project and encourage participation. The survey was open for approximately 3 months (mid-April 2012 to mid-July 2012), during which time reminders were posted online, and the survey continued to be publicised. The problem is that \u201ctrans people\u201d are typically defined by whether they intend to transition.  Regretters by definition withdraw that intent to transition, and are thus considered by many to be \u201cnot really trans.\u201d  Some regretters, like non-transitioners, accept that classification and affirm, \u201cI guess I wasn\u2019t trans after all.\u201d  Others may still consider themselves trans, but not want to hang around with the happy transitioning crowd.  Would you? Regretters who don\u2019t believe they\u2019re trans wouldn\u2019t take a \u201ctrans mental health survey.\u201d  Regretters who are alienated from \u201cthe trans community\u201d might not know about such a survey, and might not want to fill one out if they did know about it.  So this survey is highly unlikely to have received responses from any serious regretters.  That\u2019s not evidence that regretters don\u2019t exist, it\u2019s evidence of bad sampling. These numbers could be really damaging because they give a false impression that regret doesn\u2019t exist.  That could set up any number of trans people for serious disappointment down the road.  Of course, with this \u201cno true Scotsman\u201d (ahem) reasoning, the authors may never find out. As I said, this snowball method is all over the place.  I don\u2019t want to single out the authors of this study for doing what practically every other trans researcher is doing.  I felt bad for focusing on Emilia Dunham for publishing a bunch of unfounded generalizations back in 2011.  But you need to start somewhere.  And the conclusions that Regan draws are bad, bad, bad. I get the feeling that Regan and the other authors of the Trans Mental Health study are kind, caring people, and want to help all trans people.  I think if they looked into the eyes of a regretter and saw the disappointment and frustration that I\u2019ve seen, they would care about them too, and stop this denial.  I wonder if they will ever allow themselves to do it.", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
