I just found out, from the Wikipedia article, that the music and lyrics were written by 1 of the former 4 Non Blondes, Linda Perry. I\u2019ve only just watched the video that I linked, since I figured I should watch something before I show it to you.  Up to now, my exposure to the song has been involuntary; it\u2019s been forced into my brain by our local Clear Channel pod.  Aguilera does get props for including a drag queen in her video, but that idea isn\u2019t new; in the liner notes for a Go-Go\u2019s compilation I have, one of the members writes about how their (much more insightful) song \u201cBeautiful\u201d was inspired by a scene from a John Waters movie featuring Divine. So what really rubs me the wrong way about this song is the assertion that \u201cI/We/You are beautiful, in every single way.\u201d  In other words, everyone is beautiful.  I\u2019d kinda agree that everyone has something beautiful about them, but is everyone beautiful in every single way?  Well, no.  Adjectives serve to distinguish people, and when there is no distinction, the adjective becomes meaningless.  If everyone were really beautiful in every single way, then no one would be beautiful, and beauty would cease to exist.  But beauty clearly does exist in people\u2019s minds, and very few people really think that everyone is beautiful in every single way. The video makes Aguilera\u2019s intentions clear: she\u2019s fighting against low self-esteem.  I agree with her: low self-esteem can be painful and crippling, and it\u2019s good to help people get out of it.  But Perry and Aguilera are themselves stuck in the low self-esteem trap, and can\u2019t even free themselves let alone anyone else.  Perry\u2019s own words show this: \u201cWords can\u2019t bring me down, So don\u2019t you bring me down today.\u201d  Postrel\u2019s critique of the Dove Soap \u201cCampaign for Real Beauty\u201d points out the problem: \u201cOnly two percent of women describe themselves as beautiful\u201d trumpets the headline of Dove\u2019s press release. Contrary to what the company wants readers to believe, however, that statistic doesn\u2019t necessarily represent a crisis of confidence; it may simply reflect the power of the word beautiful. Dove\u2019s surveys don\u2019t ask women if they think they\u2019re unattractive or ugly, so it\u2019s hard to differentiate between knowing you have flaws, believing you\u2019re acceptably but unimpressively plain, and feeling worthlessly hideous. The cause of self-esteem problems, as implied by Perry, is that people don\u2019t think they\u2019re beautiful.  She aims to change that by gate-crashing the \u201cbeautiful\u201d category and ushering everyone else in by fiat, but this is doomed to failure.  The true cause of self-esteem problems is the reliance on shallow categories like \u201cbeautiful,\u201d and if Perry succeeds in redefining \u201cbeauty,\u201d then the discrimination and self-esteem crises will simply move to another category, and the words will continue to bring me/us/you down. It\u2019s occurred to me that at the age of 37, Perry could well have been aware of the internal contradictions in her lyrics and their detachment from reality, but left them that way because they expressed how she felt inside.  But any self-awareness she may have had, she doesn\u2019t seem to have passed on to Aguilera or the people who produced the video, or any of the fans.  Aguilera may be calculating in her performance (despite the assertion in the Wikipedia article that it was recorded in one take), but seems to earnestly believe the content of the lyrics on the most superficial level. So what\u2019s the answer to the problem of self-esteem?  Postrel continues, \u201cReal confidence requires self-knowledge, which includes recognizing one\u2019s shortcomings as well as one\u2019s strengths.\u201d I am beautiful, sometimes, in certain ways.  I\u2019m also overweight, pompous and easily distracted.  Words can bring me down.  Please try not to bring me down today. Or you can have Chumbawamba\u2019s take on self-esteem: I get knocked down! But I get up again; you\u2019re never gonna keep me down.", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
