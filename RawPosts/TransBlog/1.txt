As a trans person myself who was a gender non-conforming child I appreciate the intent behind the readings, but I frankly hate the book, and I really wish they would find something else to read. Let\u2019s think about what we want to accomplish by reading kids a book about transgender issues.  First, we want to teach kids to accept and support any classmates who might be trans.  Second, we want to give kids the understanding and good habits to accept and support trans people when they grow up.  Third, we want to send a signal to any trans kids in the audience that they are accepted and supported.  The HRC says as much in their press release. So how does I Am Jazz do?  Well, let\u2019s start by going over the plot, such as it is.  Jazz loves girly things, because Jazz is a girl in a boy\u2019s body.  Jazz has lots of friends who are girls, and they have lots of fun doing girly things together.  In terms of plot, it\u2019s no Cat in the Hat.  It isn\u2019t even Go Dog, Go! The only action is Jazz and her friends playing soccer, and that happens mostly off the page.  Everything is static, habitual. Jazz is. She likes things.  She has friends.  She and her friends like to do things.  The end. Jazz is expertly drawn as a pretty girl who may inspire some desire in other girls: if I were open to having a trans friend, these girls will think, she might turn out to be like Jazz, and then we could be pretty and girly together.  Herthel wrote that she was inspired to write the book when her daughters had just such a reaction on meeting Jazz.  On the other hand, there is nothing here for boyish boys and tomboyish girls.  They may be turned off by Jazz\u2019s focus on all things girly, and anyone who might have been thinking of her as a messed-up boy ripe for bullying would not be deterred by anything they read in the book. When I was a kid, I just wanted to be able to do whatever looked like fun, including dancing and playing with dolls and having tea parties as well as tree climbing and toy trucks (and not really soccer).  I wanted to wear whatever looked cool and comfortable, including skirts and tights and barrettes and lipstick as well as baseball caps and jeans.  I wanted to stay friends with the girls in my life, and I didn\u2019t want to chase them as part of some bizarre dominance ritual.  When I was a teenager I felt a desire to be a pretty, girly girl, but I didn\u2019t necessarily want to give up being a boy, and as a young adult I chose to become and stay a man.   I\u2019m having trouble imagining that a kid \u2013 or a parent, or a teacher \u2013 would be any more sympathetic to my wants or choices after reading I am Jazz than before.  I didn\u2019t want to be a stereotypical boy, but I didn\u2019t want to be like Jazz either.  When I was a little older, a part of me wanted to be like Jazz, but another part of me didn\u2019t, and ultimately I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t spend time as a girl in high school.  Where is there anything like my life in I am Jazz?  How does it even lead to people understanding me, much less accepting or supporting me? In case you think I want to replace a ceremony that\u2019s all about Jazz with one that\u2019s all about me, it\u2019s also hard to imagine that seeing Jazz being successful at being a pretty, girly girl would make kids more open to masculine-spectrum transgender or nonbinary kids, whether they\u2019re transitioning or gender non-conforming.  We need something that includes all of us. The best thing I\u2019ve ever read, or heard, on this subject is a book and record, and television special, that my sister used to play when I was a kid, Marlo Thomas\u2019s Free to Be\u2026 You and Me.  It has a ton of pieces that address all kinds of gender non-conformity, including a musical adaptation of another book, William\u2019s Doll, sung by Alan Alda.  In keeping with HRC\u2019s earlier mission, Thomas said that ABC executives \u201cwanted \u2018William\u2019s Doll\u2019 cut, because it would turn every boy in the world into a homosexual \u2014 which isn\u2019t such a bad idea.\u201d  (There is nothing at all about sexuality in \u201cWiliam\u2019s Doll\u201d \u2013 Thomas was joking.) I\u2019d love to see new books for kids about transgender issues, but until we have them, I\u2019d be happy to take part in school and community readings of Free to Be \u2026 You and Me.  \u201cBoy Meets Girl\u201d and \u201cWilliam\u2019s Doll\u201d are just as powerful as they were back in 1972.  I\u2019m guessing there are a lot of kids who could benefit from hearing a grown man sing \u201cIt\u2019s All Right to Cry\u201d in front of their classes.  And the final lines of Dan Greenburg\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Dress Your Cat in an Apron\u201d really say it all: A person should wear what he wants to, And not just what other folks say. A person should do what she likes to. A person\u2019s a person that way.", "feedtitle": "Trans Blog"}
