I don\u2019t expect to agree with anyone completely, but I like to find some community with others.  Lately I\u2019ve been disheartened by how much I\u2019ve been disagreeing with all sides. What bothers me more than the disagreement is that the takes on transgender feelings and actions are so uninteresting.  The \u201cgender critical\u201d people are fighting to save \u201cgirls who believe they are boys,\u201d while the trans dogmatists are fighting to save \u201cauthentic selves\u201d from \u201cconversion therapy.\u201d  Many of the \u201cgender critical\u201d activists is that they\u2019re only concerned about a recent increase in \u201ctranstrenders,\u201d and don\u2019t want to get in the way of transition for \u201cpeople who are really trans.\u201d  Meanwhile, some of my biggest fans get a hard-on talking about mythical \u201cattractive HSTS,\u201d who put all the big fat ugly hairy late-transitioning trans women to shame with their mutant femme beauty. I follow some therapists who livetweet transgender-focused mental health talks and conferences, and those all focus exclusively on people who transition.  For all these professionals, the thousands of people with transgender feelings who have decided not to transition, or have detransitioned, or haven\u2019t decided whether to transition, seem to simply not exist.  The first time they encounter someone with trans feelings may be when they\u2019ve decided to transition, but everyone reports struggling with feelings for years before going to therapy.  If the therapists only see them once they\u2019ve made their decision the system is clearly broken, but nobody seems to acknowledge that. All this screaming and pontificating and triage is based on a common faith that you can divide the world into real men and real women \u2013 and many also agree that there are real trans men and women, and maybe even real nonbinary people.  But they all believe that these categories are fixed at birth, and transition is the exclusive destiny of the real trans people.  Even the Blanchardians who concede that \u201cAGP\u201d people may benefit from transition do it begrudgingly, with a sense that it goes against their true nature as men. As someone who practices skepticism and mainly wants to see people lead happy and healthy lives, all these faith-based debates and practices seem beside the point.  We could transition all the AGP fakers and misguided butch teens tomorrow, and never transition any of the attractive HSTS and true trans men, and as long as they all led happy, satisfied lives I wouldn\u2019t give a shit.  Even setting aside the fact that these faith-based categories don\u2019t correspond to anything I\u2019ve seen in the world, I have actually seen people who would probably be put in the \u201cnot really trans\u201d categories who were as satisfied as anyone with their transitions, and people who would be put in the \u201creally trans\u201d categories who struggled, doubted and detransitioned. I don\u2019t second-guess anyone\u2019s decision to transition or not, but I tell everyone that the most important criterion they should use when making their decision is which gender they can realistically envision as hosting the happiest, most fulfilling life.  In the end, everything else is bullshit, and nobody should consider transition without doing this basic visioning exercise. But when I go on Twitter or Reddit and see the same faith-based screaming and pontificating, I feel like I\u2019ve walked into the Council of Nicea and everyone\u2019s yelling about whether Jesus is the same entity as God or not, and all I want to say is, \u201cwow, what do you think about what Jesus said about how if you only salute your brothers you\u2019re no better than the tax collector?\u201d I\u2019m sick of hearing from people who already know it all and want to beat everyone else over the head with it.  I want to follow people on Twitter who care about everyone who\u2019s feeling trans feelings, regardless of what stupid category they\u2019re in, and who\u2019s trying to help them.  I\u2019m particularly interested in people who are finding ways to deal with these feelings without transition, but I\u2019m really looking for compassion \u2013 and not just compassion for brethren.  I hope there\u2019s some out there!", "feedtitle": "Trans Blog"}
