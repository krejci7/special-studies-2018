I don’t have much to say about this now, but Sports by Brooks reports that sportswriter Mike Penner has detransitioned.  I have very little interest in spectator sports, so I’ve never heard of this guy.  Does that make me a true transgender? Of course not; just kidding.  (Or rather, it has no bearing on the trueness of my transgenderism.)  Thanks to Kate at Deep Glamour for the link.
