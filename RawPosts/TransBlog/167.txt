After learning that he was dating a dominatrix who was Buck Angel\u2019s ex, and started appearing in public with more feminine grooming (clean-shaven, long hair, make-up, fancier clothes and jewelry), the gossip columnists figured that there was only one explanation.\u00a0 He\u2019s getting a sex change (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that)! Of course, in November of that year Wired ran a story with this quote: \u201cOne source who knows the couple and the scene dismisses the sex change rumor, explaining that Larry is merely a cross-dresser, not a transsexual.\u201d\u00a0 But apparently this did not stop the rumors, and a Fox entertainment reporter was fully expecting to find a woman on the set of Speed Racer.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t find Wachowski either, but everyone he interviewed said that Larry was still a guy. If Wachowski wanted to transition four years ago, with as much money and power as he has I\u2019m guessing that he probably would have by now, but he hasn\u2019t.\u00a0 Maybe his girlfriend influenced his fashion sense.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s some BDSM thing.\u00a0 Maybe he really is a cross-dresser.\u00a0 The idea that The Matrix was partly written by a transgender person makes a lot of sense to me. Of course, it\u2019s none of my business if he\u2019s a transsexual, a cross-dresser, or something completely other.\u00a0 But geez, will some people get it now that being trans doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019re going to transition?", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
