This time I really believe that they\u2019re trying to do something good: root out the Three Corruptions of waste, fraud and abuse at the MTA.\u00a0 Most of their findings and implied recommendations are spot-on: the MTA doesn\u2019t need a completely separate administrative hierarchy in every sub-agency, with its own set of lawyers, for instance.\u00a0 And if, as Aaron Donovan admits, the \u201chousing allowance\u201d for executives is not actually for housing but really just a part of their salary, it shouldn\u2019t be counted separately.\u00a0 But one thing struck me as bizarre: BATHROOM ATTENDANTS There are 21 bathroom attendants at Grand Central making $16,270 to $53,867 a year. Says Metro-North: \u201c700,000 pass through each day, 10,000 meals are sold and they all have to pee.\u201d This is simply stated by the News reporters in a sidebar without any comment; the implication is that it\u2019s either waste, fraud or abuse.\u00a0 But come on: Grand Central has at least three sets of bathrooms (although I can\u2019t remember ever seeing more than two sets open at once).\u00a0 I think the Metro-North response is more than reasonable.\u00a0 With 700,000 people passing through every day, you\u2019d expect at least, what, 35,000 to use the bathrooms?\u00a0 There are only 21 people to clean up after them, and given that the terminal is open seven days a week, 20 hours a day, that\u2019s really at most two people working at any given time.\u00a0  Most of the time, probably only one person. Is the \u201cwaste\u201d in the salaries?\u00a0 I really, really don\u2019t get all these people who have a particular idea about what certain jobs should pay.\u00a0 In October we had the Subwayblogger arguing that people scraping gum off the subway platforms shouldn\u2019t make more than $38,000 a year.\u00a0 Now we\u2019ve got the Daily News who seem to think that people who wipe shit off the floor don\u2019t deserve to make \u2013 what? it\u2019s not clear because they just leave it unsaid.\u00a0 Certainly not $53,867. In my book, someone who spends their days cleaning bathrooms, and frequently has to wipe up some bum\u2019s diarrhea, or some Scarsdale party girl\u2019s vomit, deserves every penny of that $53,867.\u00a0 That\u2019s about as much as I made when I was a full-time computer support tech, and a bathroom attendant job is at least as demanding and deserving as the job I had. This is the same kind of thinking that gets people blabbering about illegal immigrants being required to do \u201cthe jobs Americans won\u2019t do.\u201d\u00a0 As this Slate article succinctly argues, it\u2019s not that Americans won\u2019t do those jobs, it\u2019s that they won\u2019t do them for the small amount of money the employers are offering, at the long hours, oppressive conditions and humiliating environment they demand.\u00a0 If you pay them decent wages, give them decent hours and safe, pleasant environments where they\u2019re not being insulted all the time, Americans will be happy to mine coal, pick strawberries or mop pee off the floor.\u00a0 But apparently Subwayblogger and the News reporters think that people who mop pee don\u2019t deserve that. Let\u2019s say that the Metro-North execs, scared by this News report, cut the Grand Central budget in half.\u00a0 It would be an absolute disaster.\u00a0 Unsafe stalls, broken facilities going unreported for hours, messes not getting cleaned up, you name it.\u00a0 But most importantly \u2013 and here\u2019s why this is in my Trans Blog \u2013 lower salaries for bathroom attendants.\u00a0 Lower salaries means higher turnover, which means less experienced attendants.\u00a0 Anyone who says this is a \u201csemi-skilled\u201d job is talking out their ass.\u00a0 One important skill for a bathroom attendant is judging who\u2019s a threat and who\u2019s not, and knowing that trans people belong.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve got high turnover, that means that every couple of weeks you\u2019ve got a new bathroom attendant who\u2019s going to blow the whistle on some trans person in the bathroom.\u00a0 Just what we need. I don\u2019t see any waste, fraud or abuse in this aspect of the MTA.\u00a0 If anything, $16,270 is low for even a part-time bathroom attendant.\u00a0 Imagine if we quadrupled the budget for Grand Central bathroom attendants.\u00a0 That means that bathroom attendants will actually be able to support a family in a decent apartment, and will probably stay on the job longer and take pride in their work.\u00a0 It means less overtime and less stress for the attendants, which means they\u2019ll do their jobs better and probably be nicer to the patrons.\u00a0 It means that Grand Central will be able to open more than one set of bathrooms at a time, adding to convenience and cutting down on the lines that can sometimes get waaay out of hand.\u00a0 I\u2019d pay 4% more on my ticket to Irvington for that.", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
