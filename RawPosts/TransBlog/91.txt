I just put together a draft post about how it\u2019s hard for me, as a trans person who tries to be skeptical, to believe in gender identity. Now, television psychiatrist Dr. Keith Ablow has written that he doesn\u2019t believe in gender identity, and uses that in an argument that children shouldn\u2019t be allowed to choose the gender of the bathroom they use.  And then professional troll Bryan J Fischer picks up on it, citing \u201cthe truth that we find in the Scriptures.\u201d  Great.  Well, let me deal with these guys first. Screen capture by Media MattersThere\u2019s not much to say about Fischer.  Despite centuries of trying, nobody\u2019s yet found scientific proof of the existence of God, or Satan, or the \u201ctruth\u201d of the Bible, or the effectiveness of prayer.  If you\u2019re going to believe in those, you might as well believe in gender identity, the True Self, the Authentic You, and the Two Spirits.  Or not. Ablow (who in happier days provided a national platform for Betty Crow to declare her transition) has an argument that\u2019s a bit more challenging because it\u2019s not so obviously faith-based.  Yet, right at the point where he begins to challenge bathroom rights, he admits that \u201cdata is sorely lacking\u201d to support the idea that if kids are exposed to other kids with female anatomy who are treated like boys it will \u201cdo harm to their own developing sense of self.\u201d  And yet he feels that the possibility is so strong that we need to protect kids from it. Later he claims, with absolutely no supporting argument, that he doesn\u2019t see \u201canything but toxicity from the notion of a person with female anatomy feeling free to use the urinal in the boys\u2019 rest room while a boy stands next to her and uses one, too,\u201d and warns that bathroom rights will create \u201ccompletely unnecessary anxiety related to whether they should be doing some sort of emotional inventory to determine whether they\u2019re really going to turn into men, once and for all, or find out they\u2019ve been suppressing the truth that they\u2019re actually women.\u201d There is a coherent argument in the piece: that it is a lie to say that the question of gender identity is settled to the point where we can simply take someone\u2019s word about what their gender is.  So far, that\u2019s a solid skeptical observation: the whole business with uterine hormone baths and the bed of the stria terminalis is pretty shaky science, but trans dogmatists claim that it\u2019s The Established Truth.  It\u2019s pretty strong to say it\u2019s a lie; it\u2019s more like wishful thinking. Now, it is this \u201clie\u201d that Ablow claims will harm the children\u2019s sense of self more than the gender stuff.  But if you think about it, that\u2019s a really weird idea.  Kids are constantly being lied to by adults about everything from the Easter Bunny to Moses parting the Red Sea.  Did I miss the editorial where Ablow denounced the threat to kids\u2019 sense of self posed by the myth of hairy palms?  Where did he call for the impeachment of President Bush for \u201ca powerful, devious and pathological way to weaken them by making them question their sense of safety, security and certainty about anything and everything\u201d \u2013 this myth of the War on Terror? It\u2019s pretty clear that this argument about \u201ca lie that can steal their ability to trust adults\u201d is bullshit.  Ablow doesn\u2019t actually believe that adults lying to kids is that big a threat.  His skepticism about trans dogma is just a fig leaf for his true concerns (completely unsupported by any evidence) that kids will catch the trans from their classmates. A true skeptic who was genuinely concerned about this issue might call for a temporary moratorium on bathroom rights, but would want to see the issue explored as soon as possible.  After all, it\u2019s obvious that the kids who want to live as the other gender aren\u2019t being well served by the current system.  It\u2019s a testable hypothesis, this idea that kids can catch the trans by being around other kids whose non-normative gender expression is tolerated by authority figures.  You might expect that a freethinker like Dr. Keith would want to investigate this hypothesis.  For some reason I\u2019m skeptical.", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
