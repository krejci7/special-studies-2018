My friend Donna has experienced this on the Long Island Rail Road, and last week a blogger named Bobby posted his experience from the conductor\u2019s point of view.  I posted a comment to Bobby\u2019s blog linking to Donna\u2019s post, but I couldn\u2019t help adding a correction to another comment by someone named Laser72. Laser72 had tried to gently correct Bobby for referring to his passenger as a \u201ccross dresser,\u201d saying that since the passenger had a monthly pass, she probably spent a significant amount of time as a woman, and therefore \u201ctransgendered woman\u201d was more appropriate. A crossdresser is a man or woman who dresses up as the opposite gender on a more temporary basis, usually just for fun, or as a sexual fetish. A transgendered person is someone who dresses and lives as the other gender on a much more permanent basis, usually full time \u2026 In response, I considered linking to my Feelings and Actions post, but I realized that that was way too in-depth and detailed for a casual blog reader to digest in one sitting.\u00a0 I tried to write just a few sentences saying that I disagreed with Laser72\u2019s categories, but Laser72 asked for clarification.\u00a0 So now I\u2019m trying to write something that\u2019s shorter than the Feelings and Actions post, but still says enough. The main problem with Laser72\u2019s categories is that the terms don\u2019t always mean those things.\u00a0 They\u2019re ambiguous, and that ambiguity causes problems.\u00a0 For example, when people say that they\u2019ve \u201calways been transgendered,\u201d they don\u2019t mean that they\u2019ve always dressed and lived as the other on a permanent or full-time basis.\u00a0 They mean that there are particular feelings that they\u2019ve always had, and it\u2019s quite well documented that many people who say that they\u2019ve \u201calways been transgendered\u201d have in the past dressed up as the opposite gender on a temporary basis, for fun or as a sexual fetish.\u00a0\u00a0 If these people have really always been transgendered, then it\u2019s not just possible but common to be transgender and a cross-dresser. The term \u201ccross-dresser\u201d is also problematic.\u00a0 It was invented by people who cross-dressed but were uncomfortable with the term \u201ctransvestite,\u201d which to them suggested cross-dressing just for fun, or as a sexual fetish, or even for prositution.\u00a0 It was originally used to refer to anyone who dressed as \u201cthe opposite gender,\u201d regardless of motivation.\u00a0 Therefore, it could refer to transgender people, either before they start living full-time as their chosen gender, or when they dress as their birth gender temporarily, like Bobby\u2019s passenger. This is why I think it\u2019s better to use terms like \u201ctransgender\u201d and \u201cfetish\u201d for feelings and motivations, and terms like \u201ccross-dresser\u201d for actions.", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
