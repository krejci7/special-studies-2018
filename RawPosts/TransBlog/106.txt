He then reclassified her as \u201ca man,\u201d fought her and killed her.  In response to this terrifying event, I\u2019ve told you about two alternative visions for this type of scenario.  In Janet Mock\u2019s vision, everyone accepts all male to female trans people as women, that status as is never questioned, and the man never feels any desire to attack her.  In Desmond Child\u2019s \u201cDude (Looks Like a Lady),\u201d people may see trans women as men, but we can still be attractive, and there is no shame for any man who is attracted to a trans person. Those are definitely the best alternatives, and I pefer the second, but there\u2019s a third one.  It isn\u2019t as good, but it\u2019s still better than what happened to Nettles.  It\u2019s simple: nobody should die just because they\u2019re trans.  Here\u2019s my vision: A man sees a trans woman and is attracted to her.  He reclassifies her as \u201ca man,\u201d and loses interest in her.  Maybe he even feels angry and calls her names.  Maybe he even attacks her physically.  But he doesn\u2019t kill her. This is what happened with Lewis Dix, Jr. and B. Scott.  Dix called Scott a \u201cfaggot,\u201d and Scott was right to give him hell for it.  But Dix stopped there.  He didn\u2019t attack.   Nettles\u2019 killer could have stopped at name-calling.  Or if he didn\u2019t stop there, he could have stopped after a punch or two.  Even if he was too drunk or too much of an asshole to stop, his \u201ccrew\u201d could have stopped him.  They could have said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, we get it, you\u2019re not gay.\u201d they could have said, \u201cThis is a human being who doesn\u2019t deserve to die.\u201d I know, it doesn\u2019t seem like a lot.  I wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with \u201cjust\u201d being called names and beat up.  But it would be better than what currently happens to black and Latina trans people. The thing is that there\u2019s a large constituency for not killing trans people.  A lot of people don\u2019t think we\u2019re women. A lot of people don\u2019t think we\u2019re sexy.  Some people think we\u2019re sinners.  Some people think that any man who\u2019s attracted to us is gay, and that being gay is bad.  These people may disapprove of us in all kinds of ways, but they don\u2019t think we deserve to die. This constituency for not killing us is largely untapped.  On stage at the vigil for Islan Nettles were her family, three trans people, and some lesbians and gay men.  Attending were people from the entire trans spectrum, and straight allies, including several politicians.  Besides the politicians, what I didn\u2019t hear about were \u201cthought leaders\u201d in broader African-American culture beyond LGBT subcultures: clergy, musicians, actors, athletes. Who are the people that Nettles\u2019 killer and his \u201ccrew\u201d listen to?  What if they said, simply, it\u2019s not okay to kill someone because they\u2019re trans?  What if we asked them, nicely, to say it now?  Not to say \u201ctrans women are women,\u201d not to say \u201cit\u2019s okay to be gay,\u201d and not to say anything negative about us either.  Just \u201cDon\u2019t kill trans people.\u201d How many of them would sign a statement?  How many would appear in a public service announcement?  How many would perform in a music video or television episode? Don\u2019t get me wrong.  I want more than this.  I want people to treat me with respect.  I want people to treat those who love me with respect.  I want to be treated like a woman when I present as a woman.  I know you want those things too.   I\u2019m not giving up on what I want, and I\u2019m not telling you to give up on it either.  Laverne Cox argues that it\u2019s the same problem, that we need those things to be safe, to be alive.  The actions of Robert Wace and Lewis Dix, Jr. show us that that\u2019s not true.  People don\u2019t have to endorse our entire program before they can treat us like human beings.  They don\u2019t need to agree with us about anything else to speak out against the violence.  Let\u2019s get them to do it.", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
