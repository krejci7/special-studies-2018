There\u2019s another aspect to it: we resent it, and we rebel.  When we rebel, we can wind up hurting ourselves or innocent bystanders. When I was younger, my parents didn\u2019t want to help or support my feminine self-expression, and I got clear messages that the establishment \u2013 the universities I attended, the government, the local street gangs, didn\u2019t either.  Even the famous LGBT Center of New York told me in 1995 and again in 2000 that they had nothing to offer me if I wasn\u2019t going to transition. As a result I kept my transgender feelings and actions a secret throughout my teenage and college years.  Coming out was a huge help, but even then I avoided directly telling anyone I didn\u2019t trust.  I repressed my desires, and the more I repressed, the more resentful I felt. I didn\u2019t really blame my family members who told me not to let anyone see me in a skirt, not to even talk about my desires.  At times I agreed with them; sometimes I still do.  But at other times it was easier to say to myself that they were wrong, and that they were holding me back. The more that resentment built up, the more tempted I was to rebel.  I felt alone and misunderstood, and powerless to fight even the LGBT Center, much less a gang, a college or the government.  So my rebellion took childish forms, along the lines of, \u201cYou said I couldn\u2019t do it, but I\u2019m going to do it anyway!  I don\u2019t care if I get hurt.  And I don\u2019t care if you get hurt!\u201d I was lucky.  I didn\u2019t get hurt, and I didn\u2019t really hurt anyone around me.  Eventually, I began to grow out of this childish rebellion.  After being out online for years and still getting work, I came to the conclusion that there are plenty of people who just want the job done and don\u2019t care if I\u2019m trans.  I made connections with some people who were helpful, and the general cultural climate for trans people has improved. Today I still have restrictions on my gender expression, and I still sometimes feel a desire to rebel against them.  It helps to remind myself that they are my restrictions.  I have thought through the pros and cons and made the decision to place these restrictions where they are, and I own them. Unfortunately, those reminders are not always enough.  This is why I need to manage my gender expression and avoid feeling like I\u2019m restricting myself too much.  Because restrictions and repression lead to resentment, and resentment leads to rebelliousness.", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
