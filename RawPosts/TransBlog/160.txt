I just looked at this package in my cosmetics collection.  It says, Jean-Pierre Cosmetics Eye                    & Make Up Remover Cleansing Towelettes It’s not a short-term glitch; that’s the official name of the product. I had already used it when I noticed this, but I double-checked, and it didn’t remove any of my eyes.  Whew!  I guess it must actually be “face & eye make-up remover.” Of course, I bought this stuff months ago.  I knew exactly what it was when I bought it, and didn’t even notice the superficially-inaccurate description until a few minutes ago.  Just goes to show that language communicates well even when it doesn’t follow the rules of logic. Incidentally, it seems to be very effective at removing eye make-up without causing too much discomfort or drying my skin.  I’m satisfied.
