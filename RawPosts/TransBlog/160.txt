It says, Jean-Pierre Cosmetics Eye                    & Make Up Remover Cleansing Towelettes It\u2019s not a short-term glitch; that\u2019s the official name of the product.

I knew exactly what it was when I bought it, and didn\u2019t even notice the superficially-inaccurate description until a few minutes ago.
