The video was taken a year later and nothing has been done.  Sforza\u2019s story is very disturbing.  I admire her courage for pursuing justice after that kind of treatment.  Last year I emailed the staff of Council Speaker Quinn (the McDonald\u2019s in question is in her district) and got some encouraging responses.  This Amnesty International report says that Quinn\u2019s intervention allowed Sforza to file a complaint (it\u2019s not clear whether against the manager or the police officers).  However, I have not heard anything since last year.  The report also gives contact information for Commissioner Kelly, an advisor to District Attorney Morgenthau and Speaker Quinn.", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
