I commend their courage for doing what they think will help.  But I\u2019ve read Lynch and Gupta\u2019s remarks and read the brief that Gupta\u2019s office filed in response to the North Carolina lawsuit over bathroom access, and I\u2019m feeling worried.  Where do I, and all the other genderqueer and genderfluid people, fit in this?  Will we be left out? Paragraph 31 from the brief defined gender identity as \u201d gender identity, which is an individual\u2019s internal sense of being male or female.\u201d  Paragraph 36 states, \u201cGender identity is innate and external efforts to change a person\u2019s gender identity can be harmful to a person\u2019s health and well-being.\u201d That\u2019s great for someone who lives through childhood as a girl, transitions in high school and lives the rest of their life as a man.  It\u2019s great for someone who lives as a boy and then a man, and transitions to living as a woman during a midlife crisis.  It\u2019s especially good if they are comfortable interpreting their feelings of discomfort, desire and excitement in terms of innate brain genders despite the shaky science involved in those constructs. Paragraph 36 is less great for someone who doesn\u2019t want to be pigeonholed into any gender, or for someone who feels like they\u2019re in between, or a mix of genders.  It\u2019s not so good for someone like me who sometimes feels a desire to be a man and sometimes a woman, who sometimes feels uncomfortable with on gender, or the other, or both.  It\u2019s especially bad if we\u2019re skeptical of any kind of pat answers, especially about gender. There is a straightforward case against North Carolina\u2019s HB2 law: just as it\u2019s illegal to deny a person public accommodations or require her to wear a skirt because she has the legal status of \u201cfemale,\u201d it\u2019s illegal to deny a person the right to use the women\u2019s room because she has the legal status of \u201cmale.\u201d  It\u2019s a pattern of sex discrimination. I can understand why Lynch and Gupta don\u2019t want to use the straightforward argument, though, because it makes a bald-faced case that people should be allowed to use whichever bathroom they want, even if they\u2019re not trans.  Gupta doesn\u2019t think the American people are ready for that.  Instead, here\u2019s how she puts it: Transgender people are discriminated against because their gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth.  H.B. 2 denies transgender people something that all non-transgender people enjoy and take for granted: access to restrooms consistent with their gender identity. For years, whenever anyone talked about \u201cgender identity\u201d I just thought of it as some weird feeling that trans people who transition full-time have.  But then people started insisting that everyone has a gender identity, and that because I chose not to live as a woman full-time I must have a masculine gender identity.  They\u2019re wrong; I don\u2019t.  I just dress like a guy most of the time because it\u2019s the easiest thing to do.  It\u2019s not just me, either: I\u2019ve known people who\u2019ve transitioned and don\u2019t have a gender identity. Nobody knows what my gender identity (or lack thereof) is unless I tell them, and yet they do occasionally discriminate against me, like when the woman in the Burlington Coat Factory on Sixth Avenue sent me to the men\u2019s changing room.  She had no idea whether my gender identity matched the sex I was assigned at birth; she simply decided I was a man despite the fact that I was wearing makeup and a skirt, and discriminated against me based on her judgment. Similarly, the people who confront trans people for their choice of bathroom have no idea what gender identity their victims have.  They aren\u2019t discriminating based on a gender identity mismatch, they\u2019re discriminating based on their gender classification.  I can\u2019t believe that on some level Gupta and Lynch don\u2019t know this. I don\u2019t want access to restrooms consistent with my gender identity, and I don\u2019t think most other trans people do either.  I want access to restrooms consistent with my gender expression.  It\u2019s pretty simple: if I\u2019m wearing makeup and heels, I want to go into the bathroom where people with makeup and heels go.  If I\u2019m not wearing makeup and have visible facial hair, I want to go into the bathroom where people with no makeup and visible facial hair go. I don\u2019t vary my gender expression for fun.  I do it because through many years of experience I\u2019ve concluded that my mental health suffers if I don\u2019t.  My need is just as real, and just as unchangeable, as any other trans person\u2019s.  I\u2019m just not confident enough in my understanding of my own mind, or in the state of neuroscience, to assert that this is a result of some innate sense of self. So here\u2019s what I want to know, Attorney General Lynch: if I don\u2019t have a gender identity, innate or otherwise, and I\u2019m not prepared to assert that my state is innate, do you still stand with me?  Do you stand with the genderqueer person who doesn\u2019t really pass in any bathroom, and decides which is the safest on an ad hoc basis?  If I got arrested in a women\u2019s room in North Carolina, in makeup and a dress, would you do everything you could to protect me?  Or is safe access to restrooms only for people with a gender identity? Update: Cristan Williams points out that the Justice Department is suing North Carolina because they received grants under the Violence Against Women Act that are conditioned on states not discriminating on the basis of gender identity.  But as I pointed out shortly after the Act was reauthorized in 2013, the definition of gender identity is \u201cactual or perceived gender-related characteristics,\u201d which is a lot more inclusive and effective than the faith-based definition.  So why are Lynch and Gupta using a definition of gender identity that\u2019s so radically different from the one in the law?", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
