We wouldn\u2019t say \u201cgayed\u201d or \u201clesbianed\u201d. Counter-point: Other words of similar construction, like \u201cgifted\u201d or \u201cleft-handed\u201d, do not imply action, or that you\u2019re only this way because you were subjected to something. Meta-point: \u201cTransgendered\u201d bothers some people and use of it will lead to this coming up and distracting from whatever you were originally talking about. \u201cTransgender\u201d does not pose this issue. Therefore, use of \u201ctransgender\u201d is preferred.  Ali Edwards expanded on it for her transgenderscience Tumblr:  All excellent points. To add a linguistic angle: Adjectives with -ed endings tend to express emotions and feelings. \u201cI am frightened,\u201d \u201cThat is amazing,\u201d etc. Adjectives with -ed were also almost always originally verbs (to\u00a0frighten,\u00a0to\u00a0amaze).\u00a0In fact, that\u2019s why \u201cgifted\u201d has the -ed \u2014 it\u2019s built of the old verb form of\u00a0to gift.\u00a0\u00a0 Transgender is not a verb. You can\u2019t \u201ctransgender\u201d something. A lot of transphobes believe you can, (\u201cThese durn libbruls are gonna transgender my boy if we don\u2019t stop \u2018em!\u201d), but you can\u2019t.\u00a0 Transgender\u00a0is\u00a0an adjective, though, and as Lauren pointed out it describes a \u201cstate.\u201d Like most\u00a0adjectives that\u00a0describe\u00a0qualities of a noun, it doesn\u2019t take a suffix. The sky is not \u201cblued,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cblue.\u201d The glass is not \u201chalf-fulled,\u201d it\u2019s \u201chalf-full\u201d. My mom isn\u2019t \u201cfemaled,\u201d she\u2019s \u201cfemale.\u201d And I am not \u201ctransgendered,\u201d I am \u201ctransgender.\u201d  For a real linguistic angle, let me as a linguist endorse the explanation of my friend Pauline Park (who is not a linguist):  Adding an \u2018ed\u2019 to a verb to create an adjective is in fact a very common construction in English, and the fact that an adjective is created from a verb doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t an adjective. Similarly with \u2018transgendered.\u2019 When we talk about people, we ordinarily say that they are \u2018gendered,\u2019 using an adjective created by adding \u2018ed\u2019 to \u2018gender.\u2019 It would be both grammatically incorrect as well as bizarre to say that a child is \u2018gender,\u2019 while it makes perfect sense to say that a child is \u2018gendered.\u2019 Now, I do use \u2018transgender\u2019 as an adjective to describe certain entities that are abstract, such as \u2018transgender law,\u2019 \u2018transgender studies,\u2019 and \u2018transgender community,\u2019 because it is the people \u2014 not the law, the studies, or the community \u2014 that are transgendered. So it is not at all inconsistent when I refer to myself as a \u2018transgendered woman\u2019 and also as a \u2018transgender activist,\u2019 because in the latter case, it is I who am transgendered, not my activism. Similarly, NYAGRA is a transgender organization, not a \u2018transgendered\u2019 organization, because an organization itself cannot be transgendered, only its members.  Trousered, not pantsed.  And yes, this spot in my apartment has good lighting. Expanding on Pauline\u2019s perspective, and on Jones\u2019s counter-point, there are lots of nouns that get \u201cverbed\u201d (Calvin and Hobbes, 1993) and then have -ed added to make them adjectives, like \u201carmored, varicolored, half-timbered, leisured, trousered.\u201d  There\u2019s no implication of action.  You can\u2019t transgender someone, but neither can you leisure, varicolor or trouser them.  (You can pants them, but that\u2019s something else.) To Jones\u2019s meta-point: Yeah, people are ignorant about language.  Sometimes it\u2019s a distraction, and you use the terms they want and move on.  Sometimes (especially on Tumblr) language is the focus of discussion, and that\u2019s the time to bring the science. Two points: (1) Note that both Jones and Edwards use the passive (\u201cis preferred\u201d) and similar constructions in their prescriptions, to deflect attention away from their roles and onto the wishes of the amorphous community.  (2) Note that Edwards (who is not a linguist) cites no linguistic papers for her \u201clinguistic angle.\u201d  I don\u2019t either, and neither does Jones, but there\u2019s a huge contrast between this post and her heavily-linked posts on biology and psychology. In fact, it would be nice to get the perspective of an actual trained morphologist on this.  Anybody want to go there? Finally, anyone who thinks that these \u201c-ed\u201d adjectives are an insult?  Well, they sound like very gifted and cultured people.", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
