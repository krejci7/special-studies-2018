I noticed that I had linked to Cora Birk\u2019s writings on her partial transition and subsequent de-transition, but that they have since been removed from the site. However, Birk\u2019s columns are still available via the Internet Archive, and since the last one, especially, is particularly well-written, I would like to share some excerpts: It is still (and always has been) true that I want to be female. However, somewhere along the way, I appear to have convinced myself that this desire was much more than a simple, harmless wish \u2014 that it was a yearning, that if I didn\u2019t get what I wanted I couldn\u2019t possibly go on. I\u2019m not exactly sure when this happened, though I do suspect an intense psychological imprinting experience sometime in 1998. [\u2026] I embraced transsexuality, I think, because I was extremely uncomfortable with the other terminology I was hearing. If I was merely a crossdresser of one kind or another, I was nothing more than a largely misunderstood pervert with an extensive makeup collection. But if I was transsexual\u2026 then I was validated. I could be helped. I could go on hormones and one day have sex reassignment, all under the protection of politically correct GLBT activists who would see my condition as something to be proud of. I could hold my head high in parades, and everyone around me would put aside their native discomfort with the situation and use all the right pronouns. My take on this is that the decision about whether or not to transition would be a lot easier if we didn\u2019t have to deal with rigid categories and arguments based on destiny.\u00a0 Over at the Trans Group Blog, Helen, Julie and Marlena all allude to the question of whether Penner is \u201creally a transsexual.\u201d\u00a0 To their great credit, they refuse to consider it, but their use still implies that they believe it\u2019s a valid question, and that people who are \u201creally\u201d transsexuals should transition. Let me put this out there: if we assume that there are \u201ctrue transsexuals\u201d and \u201cfalse transsexuals\u201d out there, isn\u2019t it possible that there are \u201ctrue transsexuals\u201d who would turn out to be happier in their birth genders, and \u201cfalse transsexuals\u201d who would manage to be quite content after transition?", "feedtitle": "Page 16 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
