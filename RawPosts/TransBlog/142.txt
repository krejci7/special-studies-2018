The problem is that the premise reinforces false, hurtful stereotypes about transgender people. This kind of programming only mocks those who don\u2019t adhere to society\u2019s gender norms. Tell ABC\u2019s president to can \u201cWork It\u201d now.  The link in HRC\u2019s email goes to a petition asking ABC \u201cnot to air a show that reinforces negative and damaging stereotypes about transgender people.\u201d  On their website, HRC says that their president Joe Solomonese \u201ccontacted ABC Entertainment Group President Paul Lee today to request a meeting to discuss the very real challenges transgender Americans face in the work place \u2013 with the goal of ensuring \u201cWork It\u201d can be a light-hearted comedy that doesn\u2019t belittle or mock these obstacles; or reinforce negative and potentially damaging stereotypes.\u201d With a little googling, I found a trailer for the new series, and articles at The Wrap and the Hollywood Reporter.  These both said that not only HRC, but the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Discrimination were up in arms about the new show. On GLAAD\u2019s website, I found a blog post attempting to explain \u201cWhy ABC\u2019s New Sitcom Work It Hurts the Transgender Community.\u201d  That blog post linked to a Huffington Post article by Mark Daniel Snyder of the Transgender Law Center saying, \u201cWe owe it to our constituents to speak out anywhere we see an injustice, no matter how big or how small.\u201d I don\u2019t particularly feel that this show is harmful to transgender people.  I\u2019ll explain my reaction in more detail later, but for now I want to focus on the advocacy messages. Note that in the HRC website and email, and the statements in the media, we do not hear from a single trans person.  HRC president Joe Solomonese is not transgender, and I\u2019m pretty sure that neither is GLAAD Acting President Mike Thompson or Matt Kane, their Associate Director of Entertainment Media.  The transgender Huffington Post bloggers who\u2019ve discussed this issue, Emerson Whitney and Mark Daniel Snyder, are both female-to-male, as is Transgender Law Center Executive Director Masen Davis, quoted in the Advocate. It took a lot of digging to find any public statements by male-to-female transgender people, and there was a negative one by Kelli Busey and one withholding judgment by Jillian Page.  The only expert on transgender workplace diversity I know of, Jillian Weiss, has produced a single tweet, \u201c@kellibusey I like your guest post on care2.\u201d What I find a lot more disturbing than yet another crappy sitcom is reading pronouncements by a bunch of gay men and FTMs about what MTF transgender people feel and think and want, at best referencing yet another problematic convenience-sample survey, without a single MTF voice to be heard.  Do Joe Solomonese and Matt Kane and Mark Daniel Snyder know any MTFs?  Emerson Whitney at least quoted Kelli Busey; why couldn\u2019t Mike Thompson or Mason Davis? I\u2019ll tell you what hurts the transgender community.  It\u2019s the pretense that we are united by anything other than the hatred we get from outside.  It\u2019s the idea that we all care about the same things, feel the same way, react the same way.  It\u2019s the constant stream of shoddy convenience-sample survey reports that allow some gay guy who read The Celluloid Closet or some FTM who read Marjorie Garber to set themselves up as authorities about What Hurts the Community.  It\u2019s the idea that this is a problem ABC can solve by meeting with Joe Solomonese instead of, say, an actual transgender person, maybe even an actor or producer. I\u2019m thinking of starting a petition.", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
