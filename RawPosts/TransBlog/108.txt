My friend didn\u2019t even let me finish before she put her finger on one huge problem with Mock\u2019s idea: it only applies to a small subset of potential victims. Vince Neil, the dude in question.As we\u2019ve seen, this exact same scenario \u2013 boy meets girl, boy decides that girl is \u201ca man,\u201d boy is afraid someone will call him \u201cgay,\u201d boy attacks girl \u2013 doesn\u2019t just happen with \u201ctrans women.\u201d It happens to people like B. Scott, including when he identified as a gay man, and it happens to people like Bimbo Winehouse, who identifies as a man but wants to be seen as a woman part of the time.  It happens to people who aren\u2019t even presenting as a woman.  It even happens to guys who aren\u2019t gay at all but simply are mistaken for gay, like Ever Orozco, who was killed earlier this week.  It\u2019s pretty clear what the problem is: men lose status if someone thinks they\u2019re gay, they\u2019re afraid of that, so they try to prove they\u2019re not by attacking the person they were attracted to. What my friend objected to was that Mock\u2019s vision doesn\u2019t do anything about the underlying problem.  It doesn\u2019t make it any easier for potential targets who really are gay or straight men and don\u2019t wear women\u2019s clothes.  It doesn\u2019t make it easier for people who identify as cross-dressing men.  With its relentless hammering on the \u201ctrans women are women\u201d dogma, it doesn\u2019t even help people who are viewed and accepted as woman but are reluctant to claim that category for political reasons.  It just attempts to draw a charmed circle around people who are willing to claim the status of \u201cwoman,\u201d and those who are attracted to them.  And of course it doesn\u2019t protect any of us from the violence that is regularly directed at women. Now I want to look at another vision of a better world.  There was a fascinating article by Sue Kerr about the story behind the Aerosmith song \u201cDude (Looks Like a Lady).\u201d  I remember when that song came out.  I wasn\u2019t an Aerosmith fan, and i didn\u2019t listen to the lyrics.  The refrain sounded like a distress call, the video was boring, and I didn\u2019t want to be a dude that looked like a lady.  I wanted to be a lady, or at least a girl.  I changed the channel whenever it came on MTV. The backstory is interesting, though: songwriter Desmond Child told SongFacts about a conversation with Steve Tyler: \u201cHe got the idea because they had gone to a bar and had seen a girl at the end of the bar with ginormous blonde rock hair, and the girl turned around and it ended up being Vince Neil from Motley Crue.\u201d  Tyler came up with the line, \u201cDude looks like a lady\u201d and eventually shared it with Child, an out gay man who had been hired by their record label to improve their songwriting.  Child liked the line so much he made it the title of the song.  Here\u2019s the kicker: And then Joe (Perry) stepped in and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to insult the gay community.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m gay, and I\u2019m not insulted. Let\u2019s write this song.\u201d So I talked them into the whole scenario of a guy that walks into a strip joint and falls in love with the stripper on stage, goes backstage and finds out it\u2019s a guy. But besides that, he\u2019s gonna go with it. He says, \u201cMy funky lady, I like it, like it, like it like that.\u201d And so he doesn\u2019t run out of there, he stays. Note that the narrator is attracted enough to go to bed with her, even though he continues to classify the stripper as a \u201cdude,\u201d and says \u201cOoh, he was a lady.\u201d  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Child based it on a friend or acquaintance. Both the real and fictionalized stories bear some resemblance to the Kinks\u2019 1970 hit \u201cLola,\u201d which I heard a lot on the radio.  It\u2019s never been my favorite Kinks song, but I did listen to the lyrics.  The narrator is ambivalent about how to categorize Lola \u2013 there\u2019s the famous line \u201cI\u2019m a man, I\u2019m a man, and so is Lola,\u201d but he uses \u201cshe\u201d pronouns throughout. The backstory to \u201cLola\u201d is just as interesting.  Dave Davies recalled that he was inspired by a party at the home of band manager Robert Wace. \u201cIn his apartment, Robert had been dancing with this black woman, and he said, \u2018I\u2019m really onto a thing here.\u2019 And it was okay until we left at six in the morning and then I said, \u2018Have you seen the stubble?\u2019 He said \u2018Yeah,\u2019 but he was too pissed [intoxicated] to care, I think.\u201d Contrast \u201cLola\u201d and \u201cDude Looks Like a Lady\u201d with another song from the eighties, Tone L&#333c\u2019s \u201cFunky Cold Medina.\u201d In the third verse the narrator gives the eponymous aphrodisiac to sexy Sheena, but to his surprise, \u201cSheena was a man!\u201d So I threw him out, I don\u2019t fool around with no Oscar Mayer wiener. You must be sure that your girl is pure for the Funky Cold Medina. Know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019? Ain\u2019t no playin\u2019 with a man. This is the eighties, and L&#333c is down with the ladies, no joke. (As I was putting this post together I came across another post by Andrea James that also mentions \u201cFunky Cold Medina.\u201d  James hits on some good points, but I want to go in a slightly different direction.) \u201cLola\u201d explores the ambiguity of gender and ends by categorizing Lola as a man, but the final message emphasizes her humanity and the narrator\u2019s affection for her, implicitly concluding that there\u2019s nothing wrong or unmanly with being attracted to a \u201cman,\u201d especially if you\u2019re really plastered.  \u201cDude Looks Like a Lady\u201d echoes the alarm over the stripper\u2019s unexpected dudeness, but ends by affirming her ladyhood and sexiness.  In \u201cFunky Cold Medina,\u201d thought, Tone L&#333c responds to Sheena\u2019s manhood with callous rejection (but not violence). \u201cLola\u201d and \u201cFunky Cold Medina\u201d both explore the question of what it means to be attracted to a \u201cman.\u201d The narrator of \u201cLola\u201d is naive and inexperienced, and Lola in fact offers to \u201cmake you a man,\u201d by giving him his first sexual experience.  Whether or not this happens is left to the listener\u2019s imagination, but the narrator eventually concludes that he can be a man even if Lola is too.  Tone L&#333c makes it a point to reassure everyone that he\u2019s \u201cdown with the ladies.\u201d It\u2019s hard not to notice that African Americans are vastly overrepresented in any list of trans people murdered in this country.  Correlation is not causation, and it\u2019s important not to discount factors like poverty, discrimination and civic neglect, but I think everyone agrees that American black culture is more intolerant of homosexuality and transgender actions than white culture. What if a few male black cultural leaders \u2013 singers and rappers, but maybe also athletes, politicians and religious leaders \u2013 followed the lead of white guys like Dave Davies and Steven Tyler, and black women like Tyra Banks?  What if a famous, respected black man spent some of his cultural capital to tell the world that he thinks trans people are sexy, and he\u2019s not afraid of anyone finding out? I know how this might sound to some people, but I\u2019m not saying \u201cdo this because white people do it.\u201d  I\u2019m saying give it a try because it might be working for us, just like the Kinks and Aerosmith saw that the music developed by African Americans was more fun and expressive than their own and gave it a try.  It\u2019s got more evidence of success than Janet Mock\u2019s magic circle of fiat womanhood. I think DJ Mister Cee and his boss Ebro Darden have shown enormous courage and humanity, and I think people will respond to that.  I\u2019m looking forward to the first black \u201cLola\u201d to top the charts.  The guy who makes that will be gold.  After all, Steven Tyler and Dave Davies enjoyed years of success after these songs, and are regarded today as elder statesmen of rock.  Tone L&#333c?  Well, what\u2019s he done since 1991?", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
