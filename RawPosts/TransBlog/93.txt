While that\u2019s way better than nothing, it\u2019s not enough information for them to be able to say \u201cthis is what the trans community wants.\u201d  These \u201cleaders\u201d don\u2019t actually represent any of us.  There is no way to find out what \u201cthe trans community\u201d wants, because we don\u2019t have a collective decision-making process. Whether it\u2019s the \u201c-ed\u201d suffix, the space in \u201ctrans woman,\u201d the use of the \u201ccis-\u201d prefix, the declaration of \u201ctransvestite\u201d as taboo, the freakout over \u201cprincex,\u201d generally the proclamation du jour of this term or that as being preferred, dispreferred, offensive, indispensable, etc. \u2013 it\u2019s all one single person\u2019s opinion, more or less well informed.  If it gets picked up by two people, then it\u2019s three people\u2019s opinion.  It never gets to be what \u201cthe trans community\u201d wants. None of these people asked me if, as a linguist, I approved of the term \u201ccis.\u201d Nobody asked me if, as a sociolinguist, I agreed that it would be good for trans rights to declare \u201ctransvestite\u201d taboo.  Nobody asked me if, as a trans person, I wanted people to use the space in \u201ctrans woman\u201d to browbeat potential allies.  I never got a ballot for the referendum, and I never got to vote for a rep to the Trans Grand Council. More importantly, nobody sends magical owls to make sure that all the closeted transvestites and stealth transsexuals get their ballots.  Nobody badgers the trans people who might be kind of busy with work, or raising kids, or next week\u2019s model railroad exhibition, to make sure they take the time to register their opinions on the matter. No, what we get are the voices of people who are thinking about this stuff all the time.  Those who spend their hours on Tumblr and Facebook puzzling out the optimal arrangement of acronyms, affixes and punctuation to finally bring down the patriarchy.  Those who collect dues with the promise of lobbying our elected officials to pass laws protecting us, and can\u2019t stop thinking about it on their downtime.  And of course, those who are in mid-transition and living with the trans nonstop and completely unable to think of anything else.  Not exactly representative of all trans people. So if you\u2019re not trans, please do me a favor: the next time you read about the Words Not to Say on Buzzfeed, or get your ear bent by your buddy Kyle about how appropriative some punctuation mark is, or hear from the Legislative Director of the National Council on Trans Women-Gender/Rights that \u201ctrans\u201d is exclusionary, please take it with a grain of salt.  And if you are trans, the next time you get that great idea about How the Ampersand Oppresses the People, please use I statements.  Don\u2019t claim that you, or anyone, knows what \u201cthe trans community\u201d thinks or wants or believes.  We don\u2019t hold elections, and we definitely didn\u2019t elect you.", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
