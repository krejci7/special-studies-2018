Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say \u201cthat\u2019s fucked up\u201d and fix it. Fix society. Please. Some trans people have responded to Alcorn\u2019s call for action with a petition to ban \u201cthe practice known as \u2018transgender conversion therapy.'\u201d  Here\u2019s how Alcorn described her therapy experience in an October posting to Reddit found by Cristan Williams: I wanted to see a gender therapist but they wouldn\u2019t let me, they thought it would corrupt my mind. The would only let me see biased Christian therapists, who instead of listening to my feelings would try to change me into a straight male who loved God, and I would cry after every session because I felt like it was hopeless and there was no way I would ever become a girl. I wholeheartedly agree that what Alcorn describes is a disgrace to the therapeutic profession, and that it should be stopped.  The goal of any therapy should be to give the client a place to be heard and respected, to free them from repression, and to help them find the path that works for them.  Biased, faith-based sessions where the only acceptable outcome is determined in advance is inhumane brainwashing, not therapy.  If it takes a law to stop it, I\u2019m in favor. Photo: Barbara B. Shostak, Ph.D. / Flickr. This image is not an endorsement That said, I have concerns about this drive to outlaw all \u201cconversion\u201d and \u201creparative\u201d therapies.  I want to make sure there is room for the kind of therapy that I want and need: therapy that helps me to live in the gender that I was assigned at birth. As I\u2019ve written before, I feel many of the same feelings that other trans people feel, but believing in a gender identity goes against my skepticism, and many years ago I chose not to transition.  Over the years, with the help of several therapists and the support of friends and family, I have succeeded in losing a lot of my repression, but I still have to deal with those transgender feelings, and I will probably need to see therapists, at least occasionally, for the rest of my life. My therapists have been supportive of my decision not to transition, and I am confident that if someone came to them wanting to transition, they would be similarly supportive of their decisions.  Unlike the therapists hired by Alcorn\u2019s parents, my therapists listen to me, and respect me. I\u2019ve never been to a gender therapist.  From what I\u2019ve seen and heard \u2013 from the therapists themselves as well as from other trans people \u2013 there are very few who have any idea how to help someone like me who\u2019s decided not to transition.  While they may pay lip service to the idea of not transitioning, they seem to see their job as helping trans people jump through the hoops necessary for transition.  What happens if a trans person changes their mind about transition \u2013 or decides to detransition?  Are they simply declared to be \u201cnot really trans after all,\u201d and left to fend for themselves? Gender therapy is better than \u201cconversion\u201d therapy, because it doesn\u2019t impose anything that the client doesn\u2019t want, and it\u2019s better than the \u201cgatekeeping\u201d practices that were prevalent for the late twentieth century, but it is still a biased situation where the only acceptable outcome is determined in advance. We trans people need therapy, and we deserve a range of options where we can find support for the path we choose.  We do not need therapy that is just another way for parents to repress us, as Leelah Alcorn described her \u201cChristian\u201d therapy.  But we do need support for those of us who have chosen to live without transitioning.", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
