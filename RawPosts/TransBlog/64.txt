Almost twenty years ago I decided not to transition, meaning that even though I regularly feel gender dysphoria (a discomfort with living as a man) and transgender desire (a desire to live as a woman), I examined my options and concluded that I wanted to continue living as a man most of the time.  Back then it seemed pretty clear to everyone what transition was, and I chose not to do it. Maybe I\u2019m transitioning to a new Centauri identity\u2026Once in a while when I tell people I\u2019m transgender and out but not transitioning, I get a puzzled reaction about the \u201cnot transitioning.\u201d  The first time I recall was about ten years ago from Reid Vanderburgh, but I\u2019ve heard it from several other people since.  The general idea is that everyone\u2019s idea of \u201ctransition\u201d is personal.  I can just decide that for me \u201ctransition\u201d means not changing much of anything, so then I must have transitioned! I guess this line of thinking is meant in a nice way, but there are a few things that bother me about it.  The first is that it undermines its own claims to respect my definitions.  In this view, I can have any definition of transition I want, as long as I transitioned.  I am not allowed to define transition in such a way that I \u2013 or any trans person \u2013 have the option to not do it. The second problem is that it erases very real prototype effects.  Maybe Vanderburgh and friends will respect my personal definition of \u201ctransition,\u201d but they have no power to compel anyone else to.  Even if people do accept the idea, that means that nobody knows what I mean by \u201ctransition\u201d until I tell them. As I understand it, they think that I can talk about \u201cmy transition\u201d and everyone will keep an open mind and not make any assumptions about what it entails.  But that\u2019s really not how anyone\u2019s mind works.  We always have an image for any category.  If I mention \u201cmy dog,\u201d you\u2019re probably going to imagine a common breed like a yellow Lab or a German Shepherd, or maybe a pit bull or a Maltese if you know city dogs.  If I then tell you I have a great Dane or a Bassett hound or a Chihuahua you might not be surprised, but you won\u2019t envision one until I tell you, because they\u2019re not prototypical dogs. Similarly, if I mention \u201cmy transition,\u201d you\u2019re going to envision hormones, surgery and a name and document change, because that\u2019s the common transition image.  There are so many people doing it who are so vocal about it, that me saying, \u201cI shave my legs more often now\u201d is not going to budge the needle. Finally, there\u2019s a message I want to send: that you can be trans and lead a relatively happy life without hormones or surgery, and without significantly changing your gender presentation, name, pronouns or legal documentation.  For me, the easiest way to say that is \u201cI\u2019m trans, and I decided long ago not to transition.\u201d  Take that away, and it makes it that much harder for me to say what I want to say. The bottom line is that people have images, schemas in their heads for every category.  That\u2019s the way the mind works, and saying, \u201ceveryone has their own definition\u201d doesn\u2019t make it so.  There are some things you can legislate about language, but you can\u2019t legislate prototypes out of existence.", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
