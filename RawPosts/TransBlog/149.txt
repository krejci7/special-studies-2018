The goal is to document disparities in health care, as well as plain old disparities in health, so that they can be addressed in the future. The plan is to have two roundtables on \u201cgender identity data collection\u201d with \u201ckey experts\u201d this summer and fall, and then the \u201cData Council\u201d will present a strategy next spring.\u00a0 The department will also collect public comment in various ways, one being through a website called regulations.gov, which is currently down. If done right, this could be a tremendous help to understanding transgender issues.\u00a0 \u201cThe first step is to make sure we are asking the right questions,\u201d  HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told the Washington Post. \u201cSound data collection takes careful planning to ensure  that accurate and actionable data is being recorded.\u201d\u00a0 As I\u2019ve written before, current research on transgender feelings and actions is severely hampered by the lack of any kind of representative sample.\u00a0 Just to give you a quick sense, here are ten very basic questions that nobody knows the answer to:  How many transgender people are there? How common are the various transgender thoughts, feelings and beliefs? How common are transgender actions like cross-dressing, body modifications, and \u201csoft mods\u201d like shaving? How common are transgender name and pronoun changes? How common are part-time cross-living and full time transition? How often are sexual activities part of transgender activities? How common are diseases and destructive habits among transgender populations? How many transgender people are in long-term relationships? How often are various subgroups targeted by violence and discrimination? How satisfied are transsexuals twenty, thirty or forty years post-transition?  Unfortunately, transgender research is dominated by two camps, the pathologists who make unfounded generalizations based on case studies of their own patients, and the social service providers who make unfounded generalizations based on service recipients, Internet surveys and word of mouth.\u00a0 Neither of them seem to have understood the idea that while convenience samples can provide the basis for many useful existential statements, prevalence statements based on unrepresentative samples are worthless. At this point it looks like the roundtables will be heavily influenced by social service providers who only pay lip service to the limitations of their research.\u00a0 The Plan says, \u201cWhile HHS is in the beginning stages of developing  data collection on gender identity, many researchers (e.g., Williams  Institute at the University of California Los Angeles and the Center for  Population Research in LGBT Health at the Fenway Institute) have been  working on such data collection for several years.\u201d\u00a0 The Williams Institute produces reports like \u201cBias in the Workplace\u201d (PDF), an important summary of numerous studies investigating workplace discrimination that repeatedly acknowledges that the studies are based on convenience samples \u2013 and then goes ahead and repeats percentage results as though they meant something. The Fenway Institute employs transgender health advocate Emilia Dunham as a Program Associate, and she also hosted a webinar on the issue.\u00a0 It seems quite likely that she will be one of the experts at the roundtables.\u00a0 But in an otherwise solid article for Bay Windows presenting these changes at Health and Human Services, Dunham uncritically repeated several of these unsupported percentages. There is a very short list of Experts who I think should be on these Roundtables.\u00a0 The strongest research into transgender issues has been qualitative research: listening, reading and introspection, finding existential statements but not making unsupported claims of prevalence.\u00a0 I\u2019ve said before that the best qualitative researcher in the transgender community is Helen Boyd, author of My Husband Betty.\u00a0 At Helen\u2019s recommendation I\u2019ve also read a few things by Raven Kaldera that have been pretty good, particularly his post on female transvestites (which has somehow disappeared from his website). There is only one person out there who has ever collected data from a representative sample of any transgender community, and that\u2019s Niklas L\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m of the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden.\u00a0 He\u2019s not focused on the transgender community, and he\u2019s associated with the pathologist Kenneth Zucker (who is not someone we want involved), but he does know how to do a national survey, and it would be worth every penny for HHS to fly him over from Stockholm for the Roundtables. If they can\u2019t get L\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m, then I want to be on that Roundtable.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have a degree in psychology or public health, but I did take an elementary course in statistics, and I learned what you have to do in order to make a generalization.\u00a0 But what matters more than any qualification is that I care about doing this right.\u00a0 If they can\u2019t find anyone else who does, I want to be there. Am I missing anyone?  Are you doing quality quantitative research?  Please let me know.", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
