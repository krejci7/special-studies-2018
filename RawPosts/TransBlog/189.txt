Read Cho\u2019s telling of the story first for the quick introduction. Then read Harvie\u2019s telling for some priceless details. This was a bit of an eye-opener for me.\u00a0 I\u2019d heard that masculine-spectrum genderqueer people got questioned in women\u2019s rooms, but I didn\u2019t know the extent of it.\u00a0 I really appreciate now the extent of their predicament: use the women\u2019s room and get harassed like Harvie, or use the men\u2019s room and get arrested like Dean Spade.\u00a0 Yeesh.", "feedtitle": "Page 19 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
