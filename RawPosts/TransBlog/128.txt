In the comments, my friend Caprice Bellefleur hit on the next point that I was going to make: that there\u2019s a fourth way that coming out is used. There is a further complication about the use of the term \u201ccoming out\u201d among trans people. Many, especially those who identify as crossdressers, use it to mean the first time they appeared in public in their alternate gender. They may not have disclosed anything to anyone.  In keeping with Zimman\u2019s use of the letter \u201cd,\u201d with declaring a gender transition and disclosing a transgender history, I\u2019ll talk about non-transitioning trans people displaying non-normative gender expression. Zimman explicitly excluded crossdressers from his definition of \u201ctransgender,\u201d acknowledging its use as a euphemism for \u201ctranssexual,\u201d but when I met him in February I was there to advocate rejecting that sense of the word, based in part on the fact that there\u2019s so much overlap.  Many of his \u201ctransgender people,\u201d particularly on the feminine spectrum, identify for years as crossdressers, and in fact the \u201cdeclaration\u201d he described is a performative speech act that, in the eyes of many trans people, is enough to allow someone to pass from \u201cumbrella trans\u201d (or even \u201cjust a cross-dresser\u201d or \u201cjust a lesbian\u201d) into \u201creally trans.\u201d (I honestly don\u2019t know much about coming out for queens and butch lesbians.  I do know that for some gay men, coming out allows some feminine self-expression, and similarly allows some masculine expression for lesbians, but I\u2019ve heard that that is still stigmatized by many people, gay and straight.) As I said before, I\u2019m not really happy with these three uses of \u201ccoming out.\u201d To put this in perspective, there are several advantages that the \u201cgay\u201d kind of being out confers on the individual and the community:  The dishonesty and self-denial necessary to be closeted tend to be habit-forming and have a corrosive effect on character The same habits of dishonesty and self-denial have a corrosive effect on the tenor of group interactions. Large numbers of gay men, lesbians and bisexuals being out contribute to safety in numbers. It\u2019s easy to dehumanize people when you can pretend they\u2019re not there, but it\u2019s a lot harder when you know someone. It\u2019s easy to hate people when they feel ashamed of themselves, but it\u2019s harder when they have self-respect.  The two forms of \u201ccoming out\u201d that Zimman describes (declaring and disclosing) fulfill all these characteristics, but they are only available to people who choose to transition and genderqueer or genderfluid people.  Someone who has the exact same thoughts, beliefs and feelings but decides not to transition or change their primary gender expression has only the display form of coming out available to them.  When people display they are visible in public as trans people, but in clothing and accessories that they normally don\u2019t wear, and with makeup that changes their appearance.  They may not be recognized by people who know them in their primary identity.  Most importantly, they don\u2019t use the same name.  How is anyone supposed to know that the Tiffany Sparkle that they met at the dance club last Friday is the same person as Bob from Accounting? This means that displaying has only one of the four advantages of coming out, the \u201csafety in numbers\u201d advantage, and that only when people are actively cross-dressing.  There may be some feeling of liberation in this, but it is fleeting, and at all other times they still have to hide and to deny their true feelings.  And while they hide, others are unaware that people they know are \u201cone of those\u201d and know that all these people are so ashamed of themselves they don\u2019t want their true names known. I seem to be the exception here.  I decided not to transition in 1995, and I decided to come out in 1996.  I came out \u201cgay style,\u201d by putting up a website and telling my co-workers.  I didn\u2019t start wearing dresses to work; I just told people.  And when a trans-related topic came up, I came out again as necessary. I\u2019ve reaped three of the four benefits of coming out.  I\u2019ve felt hugely better being able to talk about this important part of my life, and knowing that all these people know and are still treating me with respect.  I\u2019ve used it to build bridges in my community and break down walls of hatred and mistrust.  But I don\u2019t get the benefit of strength in numbers. I don\u2019t know any other non-transitioning trans people who\u2019ve come out the way I did, and that\u2019s a shame.  Because there are a lot of closeted trans people out there who don\u2019t seem to know that it\u2019s possible to come out this way.  The only way they see out of the closet is to disclose a gender transition.  That\u2019s not right.", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
