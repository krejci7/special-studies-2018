They deserve access to emotional and psychological support services to help them cope with the immense stresses of transition. Trans people like me who have made up our minds not to transition don\u2019t need to change our bodies, legal names or gender classifications, but we still need to be protected against harassment and discrimination.  And as I\u2019ve written before, we need plenty of emotional and psychological support.  This includes professional help, fully paid by insurance, but in my experience the professionals tend to be as clueless as everyone else, so non-professional peer support is also necessary. But those are people who have made their decisions, one way or another. Trans people need help to make their decisions as well.  That includes the initial decision to transition or not, and cases where someone changes their mind.  Right now, people are just fumbling, and the therapists  Some people experiment with gender presentation.  They often say that it\u2019s to try out what it\u2019s like to live as the other gender, but a lot of times it seems to me like simple wish fulfillment, and other times like desperate flailing.  I\u2019ve heard of therapists encouraging this kind of experimentation without regard to the ways that experimentation can change a person, putting a thumb on the scales and making it impossible to draw any reasonable conclusions about whether to transition.  (This is a whole blog post in itself.) From what I\u2019ve seen, what passes for \u201csupport\u201d for transition decisions on the Internet these days goes like this: Q: I think I might be trans. I have trans feelings. A: If you have trans feelings, you\u2019re trans. Q: I guess I\u2019m trans, then.  What do I do now? A: Every trans person I know eventually transitions. Q: I guess I\u2019m transitioning, then!  Where do I get hormones? A: Here\u2019s where I got them. This is what Natalie Reed once told me she saw as her mission in the world.  It\u2019s bullshit, and it\u2019s a bait-and-switch, and it needs to stop. For the past several years, Zinnia Jones has been telling everyone to try hormones for a few weeks, and if they feel much happier then it means they\u2019re Really Trans and should go ahead and transition.  The evidence she based this advice on was pathetically scanty, and that alone should be enough to get her skeptic card revoked. Support for people who decided not to transition and later reconsider is much the same.  Once they decide not to transition, they are immediately classified as \u201cnot really trans,\u201d and when they reconsider it\u2019s the same Q and A as above. Several detransitioners, both on the masculine and feminine spectrum, have said that they get virtually no support.  As soon as they declare their detransitions they\u2019re kicked out of the trans community (if they were ever accepted).  It\u2019s not too surprising that some detransitioned trans men convert to radical feminism after they detransition.  It\u2019s one of the few communities that will take them in.  We don\u2019t have anything like that on the feminine spectrum. What I would like to see is trans people making a thorough examination and visioning of all the possibilities we can imagine, including what life might be like when we\u2019re no longer young and pretty, then weighing them to find which one would be most satisfying.  That\u2019s what I did, but I don\u2019t see anyone else doing it. I\u2019ve gotten a lot of email and blog comments from people who tell me how happy they are to find something beyond the usual dogma and flamewars.  I do what I can, but nobody\u2019s paying me to do this.  I\u2019m not a mental health professional.  There should really be a group with a staff and a budget for this, but there isn\u2019t. As I said above, the principle that Experimentation Changes You deserves a whole blog post, maybe more than one.  I\u2019m working on one now.", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
