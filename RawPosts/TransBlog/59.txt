Yes, passing is overrated, and it means nothing in itself.  But it does have value for other goals, and right now I want to focus on one goal in particular: credibility. Activism needs credibility.  Activism is all about convincing people.  We want the public to believe that we deserve respect, that we deserve protection from discrimination and hate crimes, that we deserve access to bathrooms and medical care. We also need credibility in our personal lives.  Those of us who transition need others to believe in their transitions, to treat them as their desired gender.  Those of us who don\u2019t transition need others to believe that we can still be responsible members of society, that we should still be loved, and even that we don\u2019t need to transition. It shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that attractive people have more success at convincing others.  People pay more attention to attractive people (and here I don\u2019t mean just sexually attractive).  They also pay more attention to people who look \u201clike us.\u201d  Maybe you think that\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not the way things should be, and you\u2019re probably right.  We should work to make the world a more tolerant place.  But there\u2019s no point in ignoring the way that the world currently works. The uncanny valley also turns people off.  That\u2019s the area where people have difficulty processing an image as a person or a thing, or a person or an animal.  It\u2019s also where people have difficulty deciding whether someone is a man or a woman, or \u201cone of us\u201d or one of them.  The squirming depicted in Julia Sweeney\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s Pat\u201d sketches is a real-life occurrence.  Again, maybe that\u2019s not the way the world should be, and maybe we should change it.  But we can\u2019t ignore that the world is that way right now. This is one reason why charismatic, attractive, passable people like Janet Mock and Chaz Bono are so popular as spokespeople for transgender activism.  It\u2019s also why such people are more readily accepted as members of their target gender.  Again, that\u2019s not the way it should be, but it is.", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
