 Yesterday was Thanksgiving, a day for celebrating the blessings of the past year and the things we are thankful for.  Among many other things, I’m thankful for this blog and my supportive readers.   I asked C.J. what he was thankful for and here are his top five answers:  I’m thankful for my family. I’m thankful for clothes.  I like clothes. I’m thankful for toilets so I don’t have to poop on the floor. I’m thankful for stop signs so our cars don’t crash. I’m thankful for American fags.  (Come to find out, he meant American flags.)  * * * Quick request, if you read Raising My Rainbow and are part of a gender studies program, can you please email me at raisingmyrainbow@gmail.com or leave a comment below letting me know where you study or which school you are affiliated with.  It’s just for my knowledge.  I’m just interested.  Promise.  Thanks so much!
