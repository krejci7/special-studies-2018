It\u2019s the Sunday after Black Friday (or Thanksgiving or whichever one you celebrate) and C.J.\u2019s Dad is up in the attic handing down boxes of decorations to me and C.J.\u2019s Brother.\u00a0 As each box is passed down, C.J. asks what\u2019s in it.\u00a0 I reply by reading the writing on the box. Two boxes came down that read \u201cAngel\u201d and C.J. nearly pissed his new pajama bottoms that I bought at one in the morning two days earlier.\u00a0 He was bouncing around yelling \u201cI LOVE ANGELS\u201d while his dad was yelling \u201cIT\u2019S TOO HOT TO BE CHRISTMAS\u201d from the 100 degree attic.\u00a0 Of course we had a heat wave in Southern California the day that C.J.\u2019s Dad had to climb to the hottest spot of the house and retrieve 10 boxes of heaviness so that we could deck the halls with boughs of holly; it\u2019s not exactly his most favorite chore of the year anyway.\u00a0 C.J. finally got his wish, to open the two boxes marked \u201cAngel.\u201d He squealed out of habit and then a look of slight disappointment crossed his face.\u00a0 I don\u2019t blame him.\u00a0 The angels aren\u2019t my favorite either, but once upon a time when I loved Shabby Chic and thought Rachel Ashwell was a design super-star, I loved them.\u00a0 \u201cWhen do we paint them?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe don\u2019t paint them,\u201d I said. \u201cBut, they are just white,\u201d he stated not being able to comprehend why a blank canvas would be left blank. \u201cYes, angels are just white.\u201d \u201cDat\u2019s boring.\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad swooped in to put the angels in the spot they have occupied every Christmas for the past eight years.\u00a0 He obviously wanted to get the decorating job done and to watch the football game that was on T.V. and it wasn\u2019t helping that Uncle Uncle sat on the couch watching \u201cPop Up Video.\u201d \u201cNO!,\u201d C.J. yelled. \u201cThe angels don\u2019t both go there.\u00a0 One goes there and one goes here.\u201d He was pointing dramatically and moving things around and standing back to give his merchandising a better look.\u00a0 He was like a mini Tim Gunn in the workroom. \u201cThe angels have both always gone here,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad pointed. \u201cBoys, let\u2019s not fight,\u201d I instructed, as I do a few times each day. The angles in their place (one where they have always gone and one where C.J. wanted them to go), we opened another box.\u00a0 \u201cA STAR!,\u201d C.J. yelled as he picked up the gold star that perches on top of our Christmas tree.\u00a0 He held it high above his head with his right arm and marched through the living room, kitchen, dining room and family room.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m da Statue of Liberty!,\u201d he announced. \u201cC.J., please get back here and give me the star.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want you to break it,\u201d I said.\u00a0 Maybe I should have decorated when the kids were at school.\u00a0 C.J. proceeded to run around the house with the star, being Lady Liberty as I chased him. He handed over the star and, when I wasn\u2019t looking, took two of our beaded and embroidered Christmas stockings and put them on his feet, they went up to his crotch.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m an ice skater girl!,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Sure enough, the glass beads on the stockings allowed him to glide on the tiled kitchen floor.\u00a0 A regular old Johnny Weir. Uncle Uncle was still on the couch, now getting the 4-1-1 on Christina Aguilera\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t No Other Man\u201d video.\u00a0 The person best suited for decorating my house wasn\u2019t helping.\u00a0 Between him and C.J., I should have been able to host my own version of Design Star\u00a0and have a seriously festive interior.\u00a0 Instead, Uncle Uncle\u00a0got the boys hopped up on Rice Krispie treats that they made the night before when he was the babysitter on duty. Which was when C.J.\u2019s Dad and I went on a date and saw J. Edgar, who I had no idea was gay (I\u2019m not exactly \u201cup\u201d on history) and while everybody in the theater was hating on Mr. Hoover, I was pulling for him because he liked to dress in his mommy\u2019s dresses and because he cried after she told him that she\u2019d \u201crather have a dead son than a daffodil (gay) son.\u201d Yes, the frenzy of the holiday season is upon us: boring angels, liberty stars, ice skaters, J. Edgar Hoover and all.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 26 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
