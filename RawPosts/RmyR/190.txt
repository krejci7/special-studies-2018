Mural from the dentist\u2019s office\u2026 The night before, we fed C.J. a big dinner and dessert because he wouldn\u2019t be able to eat for at least 15 hours.\u00a0 We gave him a bath with Strawberry Shortcake bubble bath and tucked him into bed wearing his favorite Disney Princess nightgown. My alarm went off extra early in the morning.\u00a0 I turned it off and rolled over to wake up C.J.\u2019s Dad.\u00a0 He was staring at me with big, bright eyes that startled me. \u201cWhat?!\u201d I said/asked/gasped. \u201cI had the worst dream last night,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat was it about?\u201d \u201cI had a dream that when C.J. woke up from the anesthesia he liked boy stuff.\u00a0 That he was gender conforming.\u201d \u201cWhy is that a bad dream?\u201d I asked.\u00a0 It seemed like a weird dream, but not a \u201cbad\u201d one. \u00a0He explained. \u201cBecause that\u2019s not my boy.\u00a0 My boy likes girl stuff.\u00a0 In my dream, we went to the dentist and I was holding him and they gave him the shot and he went under. We waited for like an hour and a half and they came out to tell us that he was coming to and we went back to be with him.\u00a0 We walked in and he was coming out of it and he said \u2018Hey Dad, what\u2019s up?\u2019 \u00a0He said it just like his brother says it.\u00a0 I was stroking his head and he looked down and saw that he was wearing his Disney Princess nightgown and he asked \u2018Why did you dress me in this?\u00a0 Why am I wearing this?\u2019\u00a0 He was really mad. I told him that he was wearing it because it was his favorite nightgown and he kept getting more and more fired up.\u00a0 \u00a0He wanted another shirt.\u00a0 He wanted a boy\u2019s shirt.\u00a0 He was pissed off and didn\u2019t even want to ride home with the nightgown on. He totally wasn\u2019t himself. \u00a0His mannerisms were all boy, like his brother. I kept asking you and the dentist if he was okay, if he was fine.\u00a0 The dentist told me that the procedure was a total success.\u00a0 I said that it wasn\u2019t, that he was totally different.\u00a0 I got upset because something was wrong.\u00a0 He was not acting like himself. \u00a0And you and the dentist were downplaying it. \u2018What\u2019s wrong with him?! What\u2019s wrong with him?!\u2019 I started yelling.\u00a0 And, you asked if I was happy because the anesthesia got him out of his gender nonconforming phase and that he was normal now.\u00a0 I grabbed you and said \u2018he\u2019s not effing normal now, not like this!\u2019 I was so pissed because people kept saying that now he was normal and fine.\u00a0 I yelled at the dentist, \u2018What did you do to my effing kid!?\u2019 and everybody was looking at me like I was crazy.\u00a0 You and the dentist kept saying that I should be happy that he liked boy stuff now.\u00a0 But I was yelling and so pissed off asking what they had done to my son. It wasn\u2019t him.\u00a0 He had changed.\u00a0 To me that wasn\u2019t \u2018normal.\u2019\u00a0 C.J. is normal the way he is. What does that even mean?\u00a0 \u2018Normal?\u2019\u00a0 That\u2019s not my kid, that\u2019s not my boy.\u00a0 My boy likes girl stuff.\u00a0 That\u2019s his normal.\u00a0 My boy likes girl toys and girl clothes and saying things like \u2018Ohhhhh, heeeeeeyyyyyyy\u2019 and \u2018Drama-bomb!\u2019\u00a0 \u00a0I don\u2019t know what I would do now if he changed and started liking boy stuff.\u00a0 I love him the way he is.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want him to change.\u201d He finished telling me about his dream and we stared at each other. \u201cOh, baby, it\u2019s going to be fine.\u00a0 He\u2019s not going to change,\u201d I said.\u00a0 What if my husband was clairvoyant?\u00a0 What if the anesthesia was going to make our gender nonconforming boy conform?\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t bear to think about him changing either. Three hours later C.J. woke up from the anesthesia. \u00a0He got upset when the dentist gave him a \u201cboy\u2019s toothbrush\u201d instead of a \u201cgirl\u2019s toothbrush.\u201d\u00a0 When we got home he gathered his Barbie dolls and Monster High girls to comfort him as he watched old episodes of iCarly on the iPad. He was and still is gender nonconforming.\u00a0 The anesthesia didn\u2019t change him.\u00a0 My husband is not a clairvoyant.\u00a0 For all of those things, and so much more, I am a very thankful mama. \u00a0\u00a0There was a time when all we wanted was for C.J. to conform to traditional gender norms.\u00a0 Now, the thought of him doing so doesn\u2019t feel right.\u00a0 It feels disturbing.\u00a0 It feels like a bad dream.
