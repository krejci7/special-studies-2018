Around his third birthday, my son started showing signs of gender nonconformity \u2014 wearing a dress, growing his hair out and only playing with dolls while insisting he was boy and preferring masculine pronouns. My husband and I have been committed to showing our son positive examples of differently gendered people in literature. We\u2019ve read the following books countless times and always encourage an open dialogue about what it means to be a boy, a girl, a human. More importantly, we use these books to teach about love, acceptance, equality, empathy, and the beauty of diversity. Read these books to your child to help them better understand their gender identity and be a better friend to the boy who has long hair and wears a skirt or the girl with the short spiked hair who only wears pants\u2026.\u201d Click here to learn the eight books I recommend to start with when teaching kids about the fluidity of gender and the importance of acceptance. I compiled this list for\u00a0Brightly, a fantastic online resource aimed at making it easier and a lot more fun\u00a0for parents to raise children who love to read. Have a book to add to the list?
