Last week we were outside riding bikes with the neighbor boys.\u00a0 C.J. is new to riding his bike with training wheels and just recently agreed to get on the thing without yelling \u201cToo high!\u00a0 Too scary!\u201d in rapid succession until removed. The four boys were enjoying the freedom of the open road when C.J. crashed (it was more of a tip, but we\u2019ll call it a crash here for dramatic purposes).\u00a0 I ran over to him and he lay, on his side in the same bike-riding position, hands on handlebars, feet on pedals.\u00a0 He did not try to break his fall.\u00a0 The thought, apparently, didn\u2019t even cross his mind. I got him and his bike to the curb as the tears stopped and he told me that he needed to lie down on the couch.\u00a0 Okay, easy enough, I laid him on the couch, turned on the T.V. and went to check on his brother.\u00a0 A few minutes later C.J. came out of the house with his right arm hanging lifeless at his side looking like Bob Dole.\u00a0 I joked with my neighbor that for preschool the next day I would dress him in a suit and put a pen in his hand.\u00a0  An hour later we were at the hospital. And me, the wise-cracker, was being told that my son, Bob Dole Jr., had a dislocated elbow that needed to be popped back into place.\u00a0 Jokes over I guess. Three hours of specialists, x-rays and C.J. strutting his stuff around the hospital in his favorite Viking hat with long blonde braids and an unzipped hoodie (I couldn\u2019t get his t-shirt back on him after taking it off to evaluate him at home).\u00a0 We got lots of stares, as usual.\u00a0 And, C.J.\u2019s brother\u2019s irritability was increasing.\u00a0 The combination of seeing his brother in pain, waiting patiently in an uncomfortable chair for hours on end and people staring at us was more than he could take.\u00a0  As we walked to the x-ray department, C.J. thrust his hips and head from side to side excessively to get his braids in full swing.\u00a0 He was wearing a hospital gown because I couldn\u2019t get him to take it off because it was, after all, a gown.\u00a0 A mom in the x-ray department waiting room nudged her two children, pointed C.J. out to them and the whole family started laughing together.\u00a0 I saw red.\u00a0 I looked down and C.J.\u2019s Brother was giving them an evil look that I didn\u2019t know he had in him.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t even notice.\u00a0 We sat down.\u00a0  \u201cThose people were pointing and laughing at C.J.,\u201d he said as he went back to playing his Nintendo DS.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s so embarrassing sometimes.\u201d \u201cToday isn\u2019t a good day for us,\u201d I said honestly.\u00a0 \u201cBut what is worse, C.J. being himself or those people being rude?\u201d \u201cBoth,\u201d he mumbled without looking up.\u00a0  I was thinking about how I usually try so hard to balance the wants and feelings of my two very different children but that was hard to do with one in pain and needing some extra attention.\u00a0 The x-ray technician called C.J.\u2019s name.\u00a0  May you never have to hold your child as they pop one of his/her dislocated bones back into its socket.\u00a0 They gave him an ibuprofen; I needed something stronger. \u00a0After the cute, I mean qualified, doctor got the bone(s) back into place, he needed to test the range of motion.\u00a0 He grabbed a handful of superhero stickers and held them at different heights for C.J. to grab.\u00a0 C.J. was not about to exert effort for a superhero sticker.\u00a0  \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like superheroes,\u201d I said.\u00a0 The doctor got up to leave the room in search of different stickers.\u00a0 \u201cGet girl stickers,\u201d I shouted after him. \u201cWho\u2019s he going to give them to?\u201d he asked as he turned back to me, like I thought that now was a good time to collect free stickers for the girls in our life.\u00a0  \u201cHe likes girl stuff,\u201d I said and motioned for the doctor to continue out of the room to get the stickers. The next day I took C.J. to Target to get some meds and splinting supplies.\u00a0  \u201cCan I get a toy?\u201d he asked, as he does every time he gets into the red shopping cart. I usually say no, but, hell, this time the kid deserved a toy.\u00a0 After careful consideration, he selected a pink satin cheerleader uniform with silver sequins and a pink and white pom-pom.\u00a0 If C.J.\u2019s brother thought that the blonde braids and hospital gown were embarrassing, he might not want to come home from the second grade today. If you were to ask C.J., he might say that the cheerleader uniform was worth the dislocated elbow.\u00a0 He wore that uniform every minute that he was in the house for four days straight.\u00a0 Then it ripped and fell apart, because 15 dollar happiness only lasts so long. \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 30 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
