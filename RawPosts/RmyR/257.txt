 C.J.’s Brother:            C.J. are you singing “Deck the Halls?” C.J.:                              Yeah. C.J.’s Brother:             Where did you learn that song? C.J.:                              At Forever 21. * * * In school this week, C.J. was instructed to draw a snowman via connecting the dots and, then, color him like a “traditional” snowman.  Here’s C.J.’s idea of a “traditional” snowman.  C.J. has never seen snow firsthand; perhaps he really does believe it is purple.  I love the sassy snowman’s matching pink hat, scarf and gloves.  I wonder if they came as a set or if he had to painstakingly search for the three separately.  I just made a mental note to ask C.J. when he wakes up tomorrow. * * * There is a local radio station that plays only holiday music from Thanksgiving to New Year’s.  C.J. and his brother want to listen to it nonstop (which is okay with me, but it may drive their dad a little crazy, allegedly).  The song that C.J. loves the most?  The only song that consistently gets him moving and grooving?  Wham’s “Last Christmas.”  Cheers to you, George Michael! * * * This has always been one of my favorite Christmas decorations.  I put it out this year and my brother, Uncle Uncle, said in his jolliest voice: “Ho Ho Homo Santa!”  If this is Ho Ho Homo Santa, what would be a reasonable name for his reindeer?  It’s something I’ve been contemplating for days now.
