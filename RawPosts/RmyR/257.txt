Are you awake?\u201d As part of the morning routine, I make six meals (three breakfasts and three lunches).\u00a0 I do my makeup in a small decorative mirror that hangs above our wet bar, which also allows me to keep an eye on the kids as they eat their breakfasts and watch cartoons.\u00a0\u00a0I get them dressed.\u00a0 Three sets of teeth brushed.\u00a0 I do their hair.\u00a0 I load their backpacks.\u00a0 I load my bags.\u00a0 Then I can get dressed.\u00a0 Then, sometimes, I have time to do my own hair.\u00a0 All of this in an hour and a half. On Wednesday I was upstairs.\u00a0 Hair in hot rollers.\u00a0 In only my bra and panties.\u00a0 The boys were ready for school, waiting for me on the couch and watching the rest of the latest episode of Pokemon. \u201cI see ballerinas!,\u201d I heard C.J. say downstairs in the living room. \u201cI SEE BUNS!,\u201d I heard C.J. exclaim.\u00a0 Then came laughter.\u00a0 I continued to hunt for something to wear.\u00a0 Hot rollers burning my ears.\u00a0 \u201cI SEE BOOBS!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Uproarious laughter. I ran down the stairs.\u00a0 C.J. and his brother were pointing and giggling at the T.V.\u00a0 I rounded the corner to find them watching the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show, which I had recorded the night before.\u00a0 \u201cAll right, settle down,\u201d I said hunting for the remote control. Throwing decorative pillows to and fro. \u201cI see YOUR boobs and buns, Mommy!,\u201d C.J. declared.\u00a0 Now both boys were pointing and laughing at me.\u00a0 \u201cWhere\u2019s the remote?,\u201d I asked. C.J.\u2019s Brother handed it to me and informed me that he turned on the fashion show because he and C.J. wanted to watch it.\u00a0 I started to change the channel and C.J. started to cry.\u00a0 I started to think that my hot rollers had been in way too long and I would now look like more like Little Orphan Annie and less like Sofia Vergara.\u00a0 Great. \u201cMommy, pwease\u00a0don\u2019t change it.\u00a0 Pwease, pwease, pwease,\u201d C.J. pleaded.\u00a0 \u201cI love dare costumes.\u00a0 I love dos angels.\u00a0 I love da wings.\u201d\u00a0 Of course my sweet, creative gender nonconforming son would fall in love with pageantry and exhilaration of a an amazing fashion show. C.J.\u2019s Brother was blushing, shaking his head yes and giving me a glimpse of what a pre-pubescent boy might look like.\u00a0 I took a good look as Miranda Kerr bounced her perky way down the catwalk.\u00a0 I lost focus when I saw Orlando Bloom.\u00a0 He smiled.\u00a0 I smiled.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re in the way!\u00a0 Her shoe came off!,\u201d C.J. yelled, waving me to the side. The show cut to interviews and quick snippets of past Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Shows.\u00a0 I looked at the clock.\u00a0 We were going to be late. \u201cI have to put my clothes on.\u00a0 You have two minutes until we load the car,\u201d I called over my shoulder as I took the stairs two at a time and started to take the rollers out of my hair.\u00a0 I threw on some clothes, put my hair in my standard \u201cBad Hair Day\u201d style and hoped the curls would fall with time. \u00a0I raced back down the stairs and herded the kids into the car. \u201cCan we watch the rest when we get home from school,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Brother asked. \u201cYeah, can we Mommy?\u00a0 Can I get one of those underwear costumes for Christmas?,\u201d C.J. asked. \u201cWe\u2019ll see and they don\u2019t sell them in the store,\u201d I answered both boys.\u00a0 I had no intention of letting them watch the rest of the show or getting C.J. an \u201cunderwear costume,\u201d but didn\u2019t want to argue at that point. \u201cC.J., you might be able to order one of those angel costumes online.\u00a0 We can check it out when we get home,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Brother offered. \u201cNo\u2026please\u2026you guys.\u201d There were no words.\u00a0 I had no idea what to say.\u00a0 We arrived at school. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell my friends about dos angels.\u00a0 I love dos wings,\u201d C.J. chattered as he skipped to class, holding my hand.\u00a0 I said nothing.\u00a0 That was the day that my little boy, wearing socks made for a little girl, told his four girlfriends in class about the angels in their underwear and the dress up costumes that they might be able to buy online. That night, with the boys tucked in their beds, I sat down with a new bag of Pepperidge\u00a0Farm\u2019s Nantucket cookies to watch the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show.\u00a0 C.J. and his brother really would have liked the Super Angels portion of the show; I was tempted to show it to them.\u00a0 The cookies started to not taste as good as I watched the models work the walk.\u00a0 \u201cYeah, but they are in their twenties and haven\u2019t had kids yet,\u201d I scoffed to myself.\u00a0 Not true anymore.\u00a0 I was lying to myself.\u00a0 They are in thirties, just like me.\u00a0 They are moms, just like me.\u00a0 I closed the bag of cookies.\u00a0 I deleted the show.\u00a0 I went to bed and counted angels until I fell asleep.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure my boys did the same.
