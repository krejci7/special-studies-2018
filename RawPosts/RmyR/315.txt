But, Uncle Uncle\u00a0struck out at t-ball.\u00a0 And, C.J. is more like Uncle Uncle than anybody else in our family. As the 80\u2019s approached, Nana Grab Bags would sit in the stands every weekend with her Farrah Fawcett hair, Gloria Vanderbilt jeans and cry behind her enormous sunglasses as her baby boy struck out at t-ball while every other player easily managed to hit the stationary ball off of the stationary tee adjusted perfectly within their strike zone. Uncle Uncle\u2019s favorite day of baseball season? Picture day! Uncle Uncle didn\u2019t seem to mind.\u00a0 He loved to pick daisies in the outfield and tap dance for the bees.\u00a0 He was completely oblivious to the game being played.\u00a0 When the innings dragged on he kept himself busy by reenacting both fantastic acts of Annie and singing all of the songs from memory.\u00a0 Flourishes were added here and there for dramatic effect. Every once in a while he would grab himself and hop around yelling \u2014 so loud that spectators at neighboring fields could hear him \u2013\u201cMom-meeeeee, I have to go peeeee-peeeee.\u201d Nana would wipe her tears with great dignity and lovingly escort him to the bathroom. C.J. has been watching his big brother play t-ball and, now, baseball for most of his life.\u00a0 He loves to be down at the fields, play with the other siblings and get Icees from the snack bar. \u201cWhen I gonna\u2019 play baseball?,\u201d he asked a few weeks ago. His request was perfectly timed, as the local recreation department was just about to start a t-ball league for three and four year olds and the uniform stores near by were all having a clearance sale \u201cI love my baseball costume,\u201d C.J. said as he twirled in front of the mirror in his team t-shirt, workout pants and baseball hat.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s called a uniform,\u201d I said as I smiled. At the field they assembled the kids.\u00a0 C.J.\u2019s hat fell off.\u00a0 He put it back on and looked at me. \u201cDoes my hat still look otay, Mama?,\u201d he shouted across the field. \u201cYes, baby.\u201d \u201cDo I still look like Strawberry Shortcake?\u201d \u201cYes, baby.\u201d The other moms looked at me. C.J. \u201ctakin\u2019 a knee\u201d before the big game. \u201cSpread your legs, get down and get \u2018baseball ready\u2019,\u201d his coach instructed. Apparently C.J.\u2019s legs don\u2019t spread.\u00a0 His knees were stuck together.\u00a0 With them together, he bent over with his little rump sticking out.\u00a0 His knees, together, went from one side, to the other, to totally in the way as he tried to lower his hand-me-down glove to the ground.\u00a0 A grounder rolled passed him. \u201cOh, my!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cOh, dear!\u201d he breathed as he ran after the ball. C.J. playing t-ball looked as natural as Charlie Sheen giving a heartfelt sermon at the local mega-church. C.J. gets my congratulations and praise for sticking with it, but at the end of the six week season he decided that he didn\u2019t want to sign up for t-ball again.\u00a0 That\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll give it a go again later. Next week he starts gymnastics.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 32 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
