Not much turned up with those search terms.\u00a0 I got search happy.\u00a0 Boys playing with girls toys.\u00a0 Boys dressing as girls.\u00a0 Boys liking girls things.\u00a0 What are the chances of an effeminate boy growing up to be gay?\u00a0 Little gay boys. I gave up Google and moved to parenting sites and mom blogs.\u00a0 There weren\u2019t sections within the parenting sites that I visited or dedicated mom blogs for people like me raising a child like mine.\u00a0 I desperately wanted to connect and get some answers.\u00a0 Nerdy Applebottom published her infamous \u201cMy Son is Gay\u201d post about her son being Daphne for Halloween.\u00a0 I got excited.\u00a0 Then she went back to writing content more typical of a general mom blog.\u00a0 But, I wanted more about Boo.\u00a0 I felt like I was so close to finding a mom and child and blog that I could relate to.\u00a0 Enough waiting and searching, I\u2019d be that blogger I\u2019d been looking for. So, my Christmas gift to myself and 2011 New Year\u2019s Resolution was to journal about the adventures in raising a slightly effeminate, possibly gay, totally fabulous son. As a new year launched, so did RaisingMyRainbow.com. I started RaisingMyRainbow.com for myself.\u00a0 To record my feelings and experiences, like any blogger, but not to rant or stand on a cyber-soapbox or be sensationalistic.\u00a0 I started it for any other person in a situation similar to mine, raising a gender nonconforming son.\u00a0 There had to be more of us out there, right?\u00a0 Right?!\u00a0 We need support, to hear other people\u2019s stories and know that we aren\u2019t alone. And, I started it in hopes that I would draw the LBGTQ audience, because they are the ones who have the answers to a lot of my questions about raising a child like mine.\u00a0 Like: When did you know you were different?\u00a0 When did you know you were gay?\u00a0 Did you do this?\u00a0 Did you do that?\u00a0 How did your parents treat you?\u00a0 How do you wish they would have treated you?\u00a0 How did your peers treat you?\u00a0 What can I do for my son that you wish someone would have done for you? My audience wasn\u2019t everybody.\u00a0 I understood that.\u00a0 I\u2019ve heard from people who aren\u2019t comfortable with my blog.\u00a0 But for every one email of opposition, I get about a dozen of support.\u00a0 When I started writing I knew I had an effeminate son.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know that I had a gender creative, gender nonconforming, gender variant son.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t hip to the lingo.\u00a0 A few weeks in I learned that. Although I knew the difference between gender and sexuality, I had it reinforced by readers time and time again.\u00a0 I still do.\u00a0 I don\u2019t mind.\u00a0 Have I considered that C.J. is transgender?\u00a0 Sure, I\u2019ve considered it a lot actually. It\u2019s hard to see a four-year-old boy in a cheerleader skirt waving pom-poms and not consider it. Go ahead, try.\u00a0 For now, he identifies mostly as a boy. Early on, people started sending me research, links to articles and videos that they thought I\u2019d find interesting and they started sending mail to C.J.\u00a0 A dialogue started that spans 45 countries.\u00a0 As it happened, I realized something that I had never thought about before.\u00a0 All over the world, there are families raising gender nonconforming kids.\u00a0 The next generation of the LGBTQ\u00a0community is being raised, right now.\u00a0 And, you know us parents, the ones raising that next generation of the LGBTQ\u00a0community?\u00a0 We have no idea what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 As is the case with most parents.\u00a0 Some have assembled around my blog and some have emailed me.\u00a0 The joys and struggles that come with raising a possibly LGBTQ child are much the same, whether you live in Untied States, Ireland or Dubai.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t realize that until I was about six months into blogging.\u00a0 At about the six month mark, too, the hate mail nearly stopped.\u00a0\u00a0 I had prepared myself for it to only increase with time.\u00a0 But, the opposite happened.\u00a0\u00a0 I think that there are three reasons for this.\u00a0 The first is that I think people got the sense that I wasn\u2019t going away.\u00a0 They were right.\u00a0 The second is that I think people saw, in the comments at the end of each post, that I have a huge amount of support.\u00a0 They were right.\u00a0 And, lastly, I think that if people read even one blog post they saw that I love my child and I\u2019m just trying to parent in the best, healthiest, most loving way possible.\u00a0 They were right again.\u00a0 From time to time people will ask why I don\u2019t approve negative comments to be published on my blog.\u00a0 I would, if there were any.\u00a0 Hate speech, profanities, bullying and foul comments wouldn\u2019t see the light of day.\u00a0 But, constructive criticism, opposing views and uneducated opinions would be there for all to see, if there were any. I\u2019m a little Type A, if you haven\u2019t noticed.\u00a0 So I wrote a plan for my blog before I started it.\u00a0 My plan was to publish two blog posts a week.\u00a0 Monday\u2019s blog post would be the meatier of the two.\u00a0 Thursday\u2019s post would be brief.\u00a0 I\u2019ve stuck to my schedule pretty well considering that I have a job, two active kids, a husband, friends, hobbies and a life.\u00a0 But, at times, it has been tiresome.\u00a0 This is my 100th post.\u00a0 Cheers! It has been an amazing year of learning. We\u2019ve learned a lot about ourselves and our sons.\u00a0 We\u2019ve learned that for the safety of our family, we may have to distance ourselves from certain types of people.\u00a0 We\u2019ve learned who our real allies are, the people who will, no matter what, support us and join us as we take our journey and raise a gender nonconforming, possibly LGBTQ son.\u00a0 Most importantly, we\u2019ve learned that we aren\u2019t alone.\u00a0 We began having play dates with other gender creative families.\u00a0 I\u2019ve built relationships with moms who traveled this path and are a little further down the road than I am and are now raising amazing young adults.\u00a0 I\u2019ve reconnected with people from my past who were struggling with their gender identification and sexuality before my very eyes, without me or our peers knowing.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen the kind of father my husband is and have been amazed.\u00a0 Raising a child like C.J. can tear marriages apart, but, I can say that, after this year, I\u2019ve never felt more secure and confidant in my marriage and the man I picked to spend the rest of my life with.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen our older son start to \u201cget it,\u201d and start down the path of being a really cool person who has an open heart and open mind.\u00a0 He\u2019s a person who knows compassion, understanding, tolerance and, most of all, fun.\u00a0 He gets things that a lot of members of his peer group aren\u2019t even aware of yet.\u00a0 In some ways he\u2019s years ahead with his innocence still intact.\u00a0 I can\u2019t wait to see who he becomes. During the last year we\u2019ve entered the warm embrace of the LGBTQ community and the community of families who are or have raised a gender creative child.\u00a0 That warm embrace feels good, it feels like home. We\u2019ve learned the deadliness of gossip and how it can poison good things.\u00a0 We\u2019ve learned that prejudice can breed prejudice and work every day to teach our children to be tolerant, even when the favor isn\u2019t returned. One question that I do get a lot, still, is people wondering what I\u2019m going to tell C.J. about the blog when he gets older.\u00a0 In short: everything.\u00a0 I\u2019ve written every post with him in mind.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad that I\u2019ve encouraged myself to record the happenings of his fourth year.\u00a0 These are stories that entertained you and I hope that he holds them dear to his heart someday.\u00a0 More than that, I have other cool stuff to show him, like hundreds and hundreds of emails of support and some emails from people whose lives we\u2019ve changed.\u00a0 Parents who gave up struggling over gender and, instead, choose to simply love their child, no questions asked.\u00a0 That is one of my proudest achievement of 2011.
