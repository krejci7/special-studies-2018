My smart phone turned bright with an announcement. #BREAKINGNEWS Supreme Court strikes down federal provision denying benefits to legally married gay couples Was I reading it right?\u00a0 Did it mean what I thought it meant?\u00a0 Could it possibly be true?\u00a0 Was my smart phone smarter than me?\u00a0 It was too early in the morning.\u00a0 The news alert was too confusing.\u00a0 I needed it in plain English.\u00a0 I consulted an expert source: Facebook. Where were you when you learned DOMA was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? It was the first post that popped up.\u00a0 I paused.\u00a0 DOMA had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\u00a0 Where was I?\u00a0 I was standing in my kitchen with a bottle of syrup in one hand and my phone in the other.\u00a0 I looked at my sons sitting on the couch.\u00a0 I looked at C.J.\u00a0 He\u2019s growing his hair out \u201clike a girl\u201d and every strand was sticking out in a different direction due to a good night\u2019s sleep.\u00a0 He still looked dreamy in his flowered pajamas with a hula girl on them.\u00a0 One leg was daintily crossed over the other and his pedicure was showing signs of wear. I got the goose bumps.\u00a0 Literally got goose bumps.\u00a0 Something had happened and I was having a physical reaction.\u00a0 I looked at my goosebumps.\u00a0 I looked at my phone.\u00a0 In our state, my brother can get married when and if he wants to. \u00a0I looked at my gender nonconforming son.\u00a0 If he grows up to be gay he will be able to get married.\u00a0 All of my LGBTQ friends are finally being treated as human beings deserving of all of the rights, privileges and freedoms that I was granted simply for being straight. I started to cry.\u00a0 Even though I had already done my makeup in preparation for a day at the office.\u00a0 Big, slow tears took their time down my cheeks.\u00a0 One day my sons will be able to marry the person of their choice and have it recognized by our state and our country. I put the syrup away and got out the whipped cream.\u00a0 I applied it liberally to their waffles and set the plates in front of them.\u00a0 They cheered.\u00a0 So did I. I got in the car and headed to work.\u00a0 I had a voicemail.\u00a0 My mother-in-law had called to get my brother\u2019s phone number so that she could call and wake him up and be the first person to congratulate him on being able to get legally wed. My husband called on his way home from working the night shift. I answered the phone. \u201cHello?\u201d I figured that he hadn\u2019t heard the news. \u201cIt\u2019s a great day for our cause, mama!\u201d he said. I teared up again and thought of a quote I had seen on Pinterest. \u201cCrying doesn\u2019t indicate that you\u2019re weak, it just means that you\u2019ve been strong for too long.\u201d My husband and I have a cause that we\u2019re passionate about.\u00a0 We are reluctant advocates.\u00a0 For three years, we\u2019ve given people a glimpse into our lives, into the adventures in raising a gender nonconforming, possibly gay son in hopes that they would see that we are not weird.\u00a0 We are different.\u00a0 We are parents doing the best that we can as we raise a son who at times has wanted to be our daughter and, at other times, has longed to be a stereotypical gay man. Risk is a four-letter word to us.\u00a0 And, openly blogging about our LGBTQ son has been a risk that we reluctantly took.\u00a0 Had anybody else done it before us or at the same time as us or done it after us, we gladly would have stepped off our soap box and supported and cheered from the sidelines. But, that didn\u2019t happen.\u00a0 So we kept on keeping on.\u00a0 Getting more and more invested in LGBTQ rights and our sons\u2019 futures with each passing day. When I learned the DOMA and Prop 8 rulings today it felt like a victory for me.\u00a0 Even though I\u2019ve been married for 13 years.\u00a0 More than that, it felt like my six-year-old son \u2013 who has been called \u201cgay,\u201d \u201cfaggot,\u201d \u201cdick sucker\u201d and \u201cfreak\u201d \u2014 \u00a0is being seen as a human being worthy of equal rights by the highest court in all the land. I could have easily spent the day crying\u2026and eating whipped cream\u2026and cheering with my sons.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
