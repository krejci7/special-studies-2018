Thought I\u2019d share. Muah! \u201cThe fraternal birth order effect is limited to younger boys who are right-handed. In other words, if a younger boy has many older brothers but is left-handed, he does not have an elevated chance of being gay\u2026The right-handed exception to the fraternal birth order effect was particularly surprising because other research had previously uncovered another puzzler: Both men and women who are left-handed are slightly more likely to be gay.\u201d (source: San Francisco Chronicle) \u201cWith regard to sexual orientation, the most likely outcome of childhood gender identity disorder is homosexuality or bisexuality.\u201d (source: Wikipedia) \u201cPrenatal exposure to nicotine, amphetamine, or thyroid-gland hormones increases the chances of giving birth to lesbian daughters.\u201d (source: Wikipedia) \u201cStress in pregnancy makes birth of a gay son likelier.\u201d (source: Wikipedia) \u201cCuriously, gay men also have fingerprint patterns rather like those of heterosexual women. Most people have more fingerprint ridges on their right hand. Jeff Hall and Doreen Kimura (1994) observed that this right-versus-left difference is less true of females and gay males than of heterosexual males\u2013a difference that these researchers believe is due to prenatal hormones.\u201d (source: Soulforce)   ", "feedtitle": "Page 28 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
