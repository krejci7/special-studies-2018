    I’m sorry you don’t like my outfit, but if I go upstairs and change we’ll be late for school…like we were yesterday when you didn’t like my red pants.    That’s why I don’t like it when you wear your wig to sleep, it gets all tangled.  Can you please go put your tap shoes in your room where they belong? Do you have my black slip? I need to wear it with this dress. You need to keep your hands off of your wiener during ballet class; we can all see you through the glass. If you aren’t going to wear your necklace, put it in your jewelry box so you don’t lose it.  You have to take care of your jewels, it’s, like, rule number one in life. You’re getting peanut butter in your wig….again. Your purple shirts are dirty; do you want to wear a pink one? Your jean skirt is on backwards. Just another day of beading in his elegant Little Mermaid wrap...  Have you said things to your LGBTQ or gender nonconforming child that you never thought you’d say?  Are you LGBTQ and have your caregivers ever had to say similar unexpected things to you? Let’s hear it! I’m working on a project and could use some contributions.  Comment below or email me at raisingmyrainbow@gmail.com.
