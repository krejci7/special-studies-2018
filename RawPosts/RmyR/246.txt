I peeled the bags off of my arms, placed them on the kitchen counter and pulled out the Life & Style magazine that had just hit the newsstands.\u00a0 The cover headline screamed \u201cBrad\u2019s Fears for Shiloh: As Angelina cuts Shiloh\u2019s hair shorter than ever, Brad breaks down worrying that his little girl will be ridiculed.\u201d Legends of the Fall changed my life.\u00a0 It was the first movie that C.J.\u2019s Dad and I saw together (which was a milestone worth journaling about back in high school) and it was when I was introduced to the one and only Brad Pitt.\u00a0 If you are attracted to men, you remember when you first laid eyes on Mr. Pitt.\u00a0 It\u2019s like how some people remember the day when President Kennedy was assassinated.\u00a0 Then, there was the first time I saw Angelina Jolie.\u00a0 The movie was Gia and, from that moment on, I understood fully and completely how a person could, with all of their being, be physically attracted to a person of the same sex/gender. The two of them together really isn\u2019t fair.\u00a0 How can that much beauty and sex appeal cohabitate?\u00a0 Then again, how can it not? My relationship with Brangelina was shallow and purely physical for a long time.\u00a0 Sure, I heard that they did some volunteer work around the world, donated millions of dollars to causes and saved some orphans from icky circumstances and other fancy stuff like that.\u00a0 But, I didn\u2019t bother myself with those details until Brangelina had a little girl who started presenting herself as a little boy. Shiloh is roughly the same age as C.J.\u00a0 From what I can tell she is gender creative.\u00a0 From what I can tell Brangelina are okay with it.\u00a0 They were the first example of a family like ours that I saw and could relate too.\u00a0 If you aren\u2019t a family like ours with a child like ours, then you have no idea how good it feels to read about and see a family that you can relate too. Having a gender creative child will never be in fashion.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think that we are hipsters because we have a gender creative child and I certainly don\u2019t think Brangelina glamorize it, but they do make it seem a little more okay, at least they do for us. \u00a0They\u2019ve taught me to be, where C.J.\u2019s gender creativity is concerned, totally unapologetic. \u00a0I thank them for that. The article in Life & Style talked about how Shiloh went from liking dolls to dinosaurs when she was two years old.\u00a0 That\u2019s the age when C.J. went from liking trains to Barbies.\u00a0 That\u2019s the age when parents stop selecting toys and the children start doing it for themselves.\u00a0 At age three, Shiloh started wearing some clothes from her brothers\u2019 closet and C.J. started wearing my tank tops as tank dresses.\u00a0 A year later, when Shiloh begged for a short-cropped hairdo, C.J. wanted to grow his hair out like Rapunzel.\u00a0 Shiloh is sometimes mistaken for a boy (because apparently some people don\u2019t keep up on the Brangelina brood like I do) and C.J. is sometimes mistaken for a girl.\u00a0 Our kids are total twin-sies, only different. In the Life & Style article, Jonathan \u201cManhattan\u2019s most media-friendly psychotherapist\u201d Alpert was quoted as saying, \u201cthis is a culture where kids get picked on if they don\u2019t look like other kids.\u00a0 Shiloh\u2019s already different\u2026and she may already feel ostracized because of that.\u201d People have given me the same advice and I have read it a few times in magazines like the Atlanta Parent.\u00a0 My argument is that if we were all the same, this world would super boring.\u00a0 If the goal is to get people like Shiloh and C.J. to be less colorful, the result will be a dull, drab future in a place where their peers have been taught that conformity reigns supreme.\u00a0 It will be Boresville 90210, population snoozefest. A few days later Grandma and Grandpa Colorado were in town for doctors appointments and, like an AARP-aged Bonnie and Clyde, they stole the waiting room copy of Star magazine to show us an article titled \u201cDoctor\u2019s Tell Brad and Angie: Let Shiloh be a boy!\u201d In the Star article Dr. Jeff \u201cAmerica\u2019s Physiologist\u201d Gardere said that \u201cit\u2019s important for Brad and Angelina to allow Shiloh to develop into any personality that is not harmful or antisocial.\u00a0 Therefore, if she wants to develop emotionally more like a boy, then she should be allowed to do so.\u201d That\u2019s what is hard for some people to understand about the way that we have come to parent.\u00a0 There are people who feel like we should be helping C.J. to conform more and follow his instincts less.\u00a0 I won\u2019t do it.\u00a0 I\u2019m here to love him, not change him.\u00a0 He\u2019s free to be who he was created to be \u2013 short of breaking the law and harming others.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m trying my hardest to be what C.J. needs so that he can grow into the very best version of himself. Though he\u2019d probably rather playdate with Suri Cruise, I\u2019d rather he find a BFF in Shiloh Jolie-Pitt.\u00a0 Then, I could talk to Brangelina and thank them for being the first parents to show me that letting a gender creative child be creative is okay\u2026.while stealing glances on the sly.
