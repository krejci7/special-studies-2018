That\u2019s why I don\u2019t like it when you wear your wig to sleep, it gets all tangled.  Can you please go put your tap shoes in your room where they belong? Do you have my black slip? I need to wear it with this dress. You need to keep your hands off of your wiener during ballet class; we can all see you through the glass. If you aren\u2019t going to wear your necklace, put it in your jewelry box so you don\u2019t lose it.\u00a0 You have to take care of your jewels, it\u2019s, like, rule number one in life.
