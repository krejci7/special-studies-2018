Want a free copy?\u00a0 Cool, read on to learn how to enter to win. Now, I share with you the top five things I learned while narrating the audiobook: 1.\u00a0 My stomach growls.\u00a0 A lot.\u00a0 Loudly.\u00a0 Even when I\u2019m not hungry.\u00a0 And, that\u2019s not conducive to the recording process.\u00a0\u00a0 Also, the more I think about my stomach growling, the more it growls.\u00a0 There might be a monster living in there. 2.\u00a0 Talking for six to eight hours a day over the course of multiple days will make your head hurt worse\u00a0than your throat.\u00a0 Go figure. 3.\u00a0 I pronounce several words incorrectly and use those words quite often when I write.\u00a0 So, I had to sit and say those words over and over again until my producer got a version that was suitable for use.\u00a0 No, I will not tell you what those words are. 4.\u00a0 I was fighting off a cold and the sweet baristas at the nearby Starbucks introduced me to a drink called The Medicine Ball.\u00a0 I dedicate the audiobook to them (and Matt and the boys and my brother and you). 5.\u00a0 The \u201ccorporate headquarters\u201d of Gretchen Christine, the company founded by Real Housewife of Orange County Gretchen Rossi are next door to the studio where I recorded.\u00a0 I never saw Gretchen or Slade, try as I might. To enter to win a copy of the Raising My Rainbow audiobook, leave a comment below telling me one thing you learned from my blog and/or book. \u00a0A winner will be announced this Friday.
