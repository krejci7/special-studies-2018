C.J. can\u2019t just leave the mini-figs as is.\u00a0 He HAS to switch them up.\u00a0 The Martina Navratilova-inspired tennis player gets the hula girl head complete with a plumeria in the ear.\u00a0 The skateboarder boy gets the disco dancer\u2019s huge black afro.\u00a0 The Kung Fu master gets the queen\u2019s crown and braids.\u00a0 But\u2026.my all-time favorite\u2026..is this one\u2026.\u00a0 C.J. created this Lego Mini-Fig. It's his all-time fav. What does it make you think of? Created by C.J., it is his favorite too.\u00a0 He refers to it as both a\u00a0\u201cpretty\u201d\u00a0he and a she. \u00a0In private, C.J.\u2019s Dad refers to it as the \u201cVillage Person\u201d Lego and I refer to it as \u201cGay Pride\u201d Lego. In case you were wondering, that\u2019s a policeman\u2019s head with Princess Leia body.\u00a0 Check out the cleavage! Or are those pecs? I hope you all have a great weekend.\u00a0 Tons of thanks and cyber hugs go out to the hundreds of people who have checked out my blog since my first real posting on Monday.\u00a0 Especially the people who took the time to comment, you have no idea how much your words mean to me.\u00a0 Know that. I hesitated to start this blog because I feared the haters.\u00a0 Luckily they haven\u2019t found me yet! My motto for 2011?\u00a0 What needs to be done?\u00a0 Why not me?\u00a0 Why not now? My next post is on Monday, check back, I think it\u2019s a good one.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 33 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
