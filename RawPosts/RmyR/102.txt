He refers to it fondly\u00a0as the \u201cthe place with the rainbow flags.\u201d We kept C.J.\u00a0away from his town for much too long. So, a few weeks ago, we surprised C.J. and Chase by picking them up early from school and heading to Palm Springs. C.J. squealed with delight the entire way there. \u201cDid you pack some of my dresses?\u201d he asked as we drove. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cMy lip gloss?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cMy nightgown?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cMy leave in conditioner?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d And so it went, on and on during the two-hour drive. We stayed\u00a0at a truly fabulous\u00a0house owned by one of my readers. The house\u00a0is called, fittingly for C.J., Palm Springs Glam \u2014 or PS Glam for short.  C.J. has decided that when he grows up he is going to move to Palm Springs and live in the PS Glam House. He is not concerned what the home\u2019s owners think of his plans. Until he\u2019s ready to leave our un-glam home, he\u2019d like to have a PS Glam inspired bedroom. He refers to PS Glam as if it is it\u2019s own interior design\u00a0style. Waiting for us in the fridge were a dozen rainbow cupcakes from Over The Rainbow Desserts. I scored major points when I let the boys (and Matt) eat them not only for dessert, but for breakfast too.  These pictures hung in the room C.J. claimed for his own\u00a0and now he wants them to hang in his bedroom at home as well. I cannot say yes to his request at this time. \u201cThat girl is a hot mess!\u201d he said when he first saw the pictures. \u201cThat\u2019s two different girls, not one,\u201d I informed him. \u201cWow, that\u2019s two hot mess girls. Are they friends?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d \u201cI like them. I think they\u2019re funny. I want those pictures in my room.\u201d   Within 30 minutes of our arrival, we pleasantly realized that Palm Springs still does something to C.J. He feels free there. Like he can breathe uninhibited there. And, run around the grass in his grandmother\u2019s nightgown there.  He was so in his element and inspired, that he\u00a0insisted on a photo shoot.   \u00a0  After a long day of modeling, he put on his favorite shirt, a purple tee with cap sleeves that says \u201cI woke up like this,\u201d and paired it with his tight white shorts. He played in the misters in front of the restaurant, twirling, dancing and entertaining those who dined alfresco. When the misters started to turn his shorts translucent, I said it was time to go.  We walked the strip and C.J. commented on many sights. For a brief moment, he wanted to be this for Halloween because it reminded him of Katy Perry. I love Katy Perry, but I would not love this outfit on my seven-year-old. So, I\u2019m glad he changed his mind.  He also wanted this mask, but was very disappointed by whoever merchandised the window because he did not approve of the mask paired with a plaid, flannel shirt. He talked about that for a while.  The next day, before we left, C.J. worked on some of his\u00a0fashion designs.  And enjoyed pool time with his Dad while Chase and I watched a movie.   When we were packing up to leave the PS Glam House, C.J. saw a postcard with pictures of other properties owned by my reader. He studied those pictures like he was picking Christmas presents out of the Target catalog. \u201cI want to have my next birthday party at that house,\u201d he said referring to the PS Mid-Century House. \u201cAnd, then I want to keep it as my present.\u201d I think C.J. is bound to make a home in Palm Springs\u2026whether that home\u2019s owners like it or not.    \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
