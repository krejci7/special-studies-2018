If his Christmas gift to you is 10 days and nights of free childcare. If you are a parent, you will understand how priceless this gift is. If you\u2019re not a parent, give this gift to someone you love. Uncle Michael had the boys for two nights and three days during Spring Break. They went to the Shake Shack for lunch, Au Fudge for brunch, decorated cake at Duff\u2019s Cakemix, hosted a dinner party, made \u201cSpaghetti Two Ways\u201d (don\u2019t ask), visited the La Brea Tar Pits, stayed up past their bedtime and counted 110 cigarette butts on the ground during their stay (my kids are weird). C.J. and Chase thought they had the best time, but Matt and I were wine tasting so obviously we won. As we drove home from West Hollywood to Orange County, the boys were mostly quiet in the backseat, until C.J. shouted, \u201cI forgot to tell you, gurl!!! I\u2019m a drag queen!\u201d Turns our, my brother had also let them watch RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. A few days later \u2014 after much begging \u2013 I agreed to sit down and watch Drag Race with C.J. I had seen clips from the show here and there, but never a full episode. \u201cYou\u2019re going to like this show, mom. When we watch it, we all get their \u2018hes\u2019 and \u2018shes\u2019 mixed up like people do when they talk about me,\u201d he said. If that\u2019s not a solid reason to watch, I don\u2019t know what is. We started with the current season\u2019s first episode and C.J. immediately started rapid-firing questions that I could not answer. I had to text my brother. Over and over and over again. I used to think\u00a0 I was pretty knowledgeable about LGBTQ culture. Watching Drag Race with my nine-year-old son has taught me that there is much for me to learn. I also texted my friend Jeff who watches Drag Race and is one of my go-to people when it comes to LGBTQ-related things.  Bob The Drag Queen continues to be C.J.\u2019s overall favorite contestant this season, while he thinks Kim Chi has the best makeup. \u201cThat\u2019s sad that Kim Chi\u2019s mom, Mrs. Chi, doesn\u2019t know that she is a drag queen and wouldn\u2019t approve. I would always tell you if I was a drag queen and I\u2019d want you and dad and Chase to come to my shows!\u201d My heart swelled. When your son tells you that if he were a drag queen he\u2019d want you to watch him perform, you know you\u2019ve done something right as a parent. Naomi Smalls is still my favorite and I want her body. But I\u2019m 38, have had two kids and like to eat chips, so it\u2019s a dream that will never be realized. C.J.\u2019s favorite part of each episode is when the two final contestants have to lip sync for their lives. He asked me if I\u2019ve ever had to lip sync for my life. I have not. And, be warned Drag Race contestants current and future, if you take your heels and/or wig off to lip sync for your life, C.J. will automatically yell at the TV that you need to sashay away. At first we were moving very slowly through the season. When we finally did get caught up on the current season, C.J. asked if we could watch a past season while we waited for a new episode. I found season four for free on Amazon. Watching two seasons at once has me getting all of my queens and challenges confused. Thankfully C.J. remembers them all (even though he has a hard time remembering his multiplication tables), so he helps me along. In conclusion, I\u2019ll leave you with our house rules for watching the show, in case you need some boundaries for yourself and/or your house: Current Rules C.J. Must Follow In Order To Watch RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race  All homework must be done. You must watch it with your mom or dad. We don\u2019t use the word \u201cfishy\u201d to describe people. (He has no idea what this alludes to.) We don\u2019t use the words \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cfuck.\u201d (Well, I do, but he\u2019s not allowed yet.) Even though RuPaul says \u201cCon-drag-ulations\u201d the real word is \u201cCongratulations\u201d and we use that. (In case it\u2019s ever on a spelling test.) We don\u2019t put glue sticks in our eyebrows until we are a little bit older or have adult supervision for the application and removal. (I\u2019m not looking forward to dealing with this mess.) We don\u2019t attempt to glue our wigs to our heads. (I wouldn\u2019t even know where to begin.) We fast forward through \u201cShade Throwing\u201d because that\u2019s not a nice way to talk to people. (I think he will eventually need to learn to throw shade, but not just yet.) As soon as the show is over, it\u2019s time to immediately sashay away to bed.    ", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
