The survey is 100 percent anonymous. I\u2019m not interested in who you are; I\u2019m interested in what grade you teach, the state you live in and what you know about protecting LGBTQ students. The results will be woven into a longer piece I\u2019m writing about addressing LGBTQ bullying in America\u2019s schools. If I publish results, it would happen on my blog; but, currently, my only goal is to include my findings in the aforementioned piece. I really just want to get a feel for what teachers currently know so that I may be able to:  Help them learn more; Help parents/primary caregivers of LGBTQ students better communicate with teachers should a problem arise; and Urge districts and school to do more to educate faculty and staff about LGBTQ bullying.  I ask credentialed educators and administrators from across the U.S. who are currently or have recently taught in grades K-12 to participate. If you are outside of this demographic, but want to discuss LGBTQ bullying in schools, please email me directly at raisingmyrainbow@gmail.com instead of taking the survey. Please share this link far and wide. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9X987MM All best, Lori Duron   ", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
