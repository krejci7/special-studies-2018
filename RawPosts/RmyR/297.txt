From there we went to the Farm, where C.J. picked strawberries and harassed the tiny, puffy baby chicks from behind the glass.\u00a0 We went to the Caf\u00e9, where C.J. served me pizza and called me \u201cMama Mia.\u201d\u00a0 We went to the Marina, but C.J. refused to fish because it was \u201ctoo icky.\u201d We spent most of our time, by far, at the Amphitheater, which is a stage complete with costumes and instruments; a soundboard that operates lights and music; and rows and rows of seating for a captive audience.\u00a0 C.J. found his home in Pretend City. So many costumes, so little time.\u00a0 Seriously. A silver flapper dress?\u00a0 Oh, yeah, he rocked it for a while.\u00a0 A pink princess gown?\u00a0 It was his favorite.\u00a0 Now, for the shoes.\u00a0 Pink go-go boots?\u00a0 They were\u00a0fabulous, but zipped up to his crotch and were a tad bit inhibiting.\u00a0 Ruby slippers?\u00a0 Werk. With his outfit assembled it was time to hit the stage.\u00a0 What?\u00a0 Right, an instrument.\u00a0 Tambourine or maracas?\u00a0 Tambourine, you know it. He entered stage left, ready for his solo.\u00a0 What?\u00a0 There were other people on the stage?\u00a0 C.J. rolled his eyes and then started throwing elbows to get down to center stage, where he belongs, obviously.\u00a0 I tried to explain that sometimes you have to hang back and be in the chorus.\u00a0 If looks could kill.\u00a0 It was a solid hour of costume changes, prop switches and Broadway-worthy performances.\u00a0 From time to time he would get the stage all to himself.\u00a0 Those were the happiest of times.\u00a0 Every now and then an un-costumed boy would enter the stage and stare oddly at C.J.\u00a0 Those were the worst of times.\u00a0 \u00a0And, if C.J. did happen to see a strange look cast in his direction, he would, in return, give that child a look as if to say \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re not fabulous like me.\u00a0 Really it\u2019s a shame.\u201d I got looks too.\u00a0 Parents smiled at the sight of C.J., up on stage, in a pink sequined princess dress with red sparkly Mary Jane\u2019s.\u00a0 Then, they searched the crowd for the adult to whom he belonged.\u00a0 Some smiled with me, and I could tell that they were seeing an imaginative little boy expressing himself freely.\u00a0 Others smiled at me, and I could tell they were seeing an embarrassment of a child who would, no doubt, have issues as an adult due to my horrible parenting skills.\u00a0 We delight some and disturb others.\u00a0 Yet another thing I learned at a children\u2019s museum.
