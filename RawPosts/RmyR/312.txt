C.J. doesn\u2019t want a Hot Wheels Battle Force 5 Fused car, he wants a Barbie: A Fairy Secret doll. C.J. doesn\u2019t want a Young Justice action figure, he wants a Littlest Pet Shop pet. What C.J. wants totally confuses McDonald\u2019s. January 21: We walk into McDonald\u2019s and order a Happy Meal.\u00a0 \u201cFor a boy, right?,\u201d the cashier asks looking at C.J. \u201cIt\u2019s for a boy, but we would like the girl toy,\u201d I explain, as I have to on most trips to C.J.\u2019s favorite dining establishment. C.J. always looks back and forth between me and the cashier with eyes that tell me that he is fearful his request for a girl toy might be rejected because he is \u2013 obviously \u2014 a boy.\u00a0 He isn\u2019t concerned with what the cashier thinks; he just wants \u2013 like every four year old \u2013 to get what he wants.\u00a0 He breathes a sigh of relief when his wish is granted. An anxiety attack and tears are averted.  You can't blame C.J. I mean, which toy would you rather have? February 22: We walk into McDonald\u2019s and order a Happy Meal. \u201cWould you like a boy toy or girl toy?\u201d the manager asks before seeing C.J. and saying \u201cOh, sorry, you want a boy toy.\u201d \u201cNo, no, we want the girl toy,\u201d I said, pretending to be really pleasant. \u201cOh, I just thought that since he\u2019s a\u2026.\u201d \u201cYes, but we\u2019ll take the girl toy,\u201d I say loudly and firmly with a saccharin smile that says \u201cgive me the damn girl toy and don\u2019t cause a scene.\u201d (Awkward moment goes here.) Again, the choice is so obvious. March 7: We drive up to McDonald\u2019s and order a Happy Meal. \u201cFor a boy or a girl?\u201d the bored voice mumbles out of the metal drive-through box. \u201cIt\u2019s for a girl,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad says, upset that gender identity issues are now being served with his Big Mac. As wonderful as C.J.\u2019s Dad is about raising a slightly effeminate, fabulous son, it does bother him to call him a girl. I told him that he didn\u2019t have to refer to C.J. as a girl, he could have selected his words differently and suddenly we are Mr. and Mrs. Bickerson.\u00a0 C.J.\u2019s Dad\u2019s face turns red and he grips the steering wheel a little tighter.\u00a0 I start to giggle. We aren\u2019t the only family dealing with such McProblems. The very next day, my college friend C posted this on her Facebook: \u201cI don\u2019t like that when ordering a Happy Meal I\u2019m asked if it is for a boy or a girl, when the question should actually be \u201cdo you want a car or a Barbie?\u201d Amen sister!\u00a0 A handful of other moms agreed on C\u2019s Facebook page.\u00a0 C\u2019s little guy isn\u2019t slightly effeminate, like C.J., but she explains that \u201cother than the obvious obnoxiousness\u00a0of the gender stereotyping going on, sometimes the \u201copposite gender\u201d toy is the better choice for my son. He knows what a stuffed bear is, not so much a Bakugan\u00a0whosie-whatsit. \u201c C.J.\u2019s Brother noticed that there is a Happy Meal website with fun games and activities.\u00a0 We pull up the site and start to register to play.\u00a0 McDonald\u2019s, again, wants to know if we are a boy or a girl.\u00a0 I can\u2019t explain to the computer that we have one boy who likes to play with boy toys and one boy who likes to play with girl toys.\u00a0 We log off. \u00a0If McDonald\u2019s keeps this up, I\u2019ll have to make lunch more often.\u00a0 Tears.
