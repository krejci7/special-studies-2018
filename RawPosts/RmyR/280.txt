Thanks to everybody who checked out the Handsome In Pink website and entered to win! The super lucky winner is commenter #54, Jesse R.! Congrats, Jesse, C.J. picked your name out of his purple velevet handbag and then got upset because he thought he had to give you his Handsome In Pink shirt. Once he learned that you won your own Handsome In Pink shirt, and not his, he was happy for you. In my last post I mentioned that we hadn\u2019t seen a rainbow in Colorado. That all changed on Wednesday, much to C.J.\u2019s delight.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 28 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
