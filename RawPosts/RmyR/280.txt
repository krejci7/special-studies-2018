All Posts Colorado Handsome In Pink 
 Last week I announced a giveaway from Handsome In Pink. Thanks to everybody who checked out the Handsome In Pink website and entered to win! The super lucky winner is commenter #54, Jesse R.! Congrats, Jesse, C.J. picked your name out of his purple velevet handbag and then got upset because he thought he had to give you his Handsome In Pink shirt. Once he learned that you won your own Handsome In Pink shirt, and not his, he was happy for you. In my last post I mentioned that we hadn’t seen a rainbow in Colorado. That all changed on Wednesday, much to C.J.’s delight.
