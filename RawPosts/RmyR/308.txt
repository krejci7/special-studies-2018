 Because we are so used to C.J. being, well, C.J, sometimes when he does something or plays with something typically considered “boy” it catches us off guard.  C.J. isn’t always our slightly effeminate, possibly gay, totally fabulous son; sometimes he’s very much our slightly masculine, possibly heterosexual, totally rambunctious son. Besides identifying as boy and wearing boy clothes, he:  Loves to be scared and doesn’t shy away from a good scary movie Occasionally enjoys a good country song laden with twang Has an intense need for speed while riding his scooter Searches out fences and trees to scale Lists potty-talk as his preferred language Laughs uncontrollably at pratfalls (someone getting hit in the balls is at the top of the list, obviously) Sees a bug and wants to play with it, trap it and, often times, smash it Has horrible aim in the bathroom Doesn’t mind a snotty, messy face Loves to wrestle with his dad and brother Has never let a good fart go unnoticed or unclaimed
