Centerpiece by C.J. (All photos on this page are not at all related to the words on this page. \u00a0Sorry.) We arrived early and walked around the center. It was dark and there were strands of white lights strung high above our heads as a live band played in the crisp air.\u00a0 CJ\u2019s Brother walked with his hands in his pockets because he thinks it makes him look like a teenager. \u00a0Every once in a while he would hold my hand\u2026forgetting that he was trying to look cool. We were window shopping when he stopped in front of a jewelry store to look at\u00a0the displays. \u201cAre you looking for some diamonds to buy for your mom?\u201d I said teasingly, putting my hand on his shoulder. \u201cNo, I\u2019m looking for an engagement ring,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are way too young to get engaged, sir.\u201d \u201cI know. I\u2019m looking for later, to see what I might want to buy when I want to get engaged, so I can start saving. How much do I have to save anyway?\u00a0 Like a couple hundred dollars?\u201d Sweet N Low sack dress by C.J. \u201cA couple thousand dollars,\u201d I said. His jaw dropped. \u201cI really better start saving I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get married. I want you to stay my baby forever,\u201d I said hugging him from behind. \u201cDon\u2019t you want grandchildren?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. He pulled out of my embrace and spun to look at me. \u201cThat is so mean. How can you not want grandchildren?\u201d His feelings were hurt. \u00a0Crap. \u00a0I struggled to explain. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal, baby. I don\u2019t expect grandchildren. I don\u2019t need grandchildren to make me happy. I want you to be happy. If having kids makes you happy then I\u2019m happy. But, I really try not to project my expectations on you.\u201d It was going over his head a little. \u00a0After all, he is only nine years old. My history was interfering with my present, as it tends to do.\u00a0 My mom wanted grandchildren her entire life. If she could have had grandchildren without having children she probably would have. \u00a0I knew it. \u00a0My brother knew. It was one of the hardest things for her to deal with when he came out. \u00a0She had to mourn the loss of the grandchildren he\u2019d never give her. I\u2019ve watched it happen over and over at PFLAG.\u00a0 People look forward to grandchildren and when their child comes out of the closet they assume that they won\u2019t have grandchildren and it hurts.\u00a0 I can understand that. So I decided long ago that I wasn\u2019t going to look forward to grandchildren until they were nine months away from appearing. I wasn\u2019t going to count on a future generation for even a fraction of happiness. I was going to spend my energy making the generation that I was responsible for happy. I thought I was doing the right thing. I thought that I was doing us all a favor \u2014 until it hurt my son\u2019s feelings. Runway walk by C.J. \u201cIf you have a child I will love it with all of my heart because it will be half you and you are one of my top three favorite people in the world. I think that you are amazing. I just want you to know that you don\u2019t have to give me grandkids to make me happy. You make me happy all on your own,\u201d I told C.J.\u2019s Brother. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said skeptically. I felt like a turd. My brother and C.J. have taught me that you don\u2019t always get what you expect when you are expecting.\u00a0 And that can mess with your head and heart. So I try to let go of expectations and not to expect things or people to conform.\u00a0 But, every once in a while my oldest, gender conforming boy wants me to expect the norm. I walked him into the laser tag building and watched him play with his friends and, for a moment, thought about my grandkids.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
