I think my mom is 48 years old.\u00a0 (I\u2019ll have you all know that he overshot it by 13 years.\u00a0 Notice on the illustration, he originally went with 30 something \u2014 but, upon further consideration, he made me almost 50.)  You can tell she\u2019s a mom because she is beautiful. \u00a0(This made up for the fact that he thinks I\u2019m nearly old enough to join AARP)  I think she learned how to be a mom by reading a book.\u00a0 (This part is true.\u00a0 Do you like the high heels I wear while reading?)  My mom wanted to have children because she had children.\u00a0 (That pretty much sums up how it all happened.)  While I\u2019m at school, my mom works. \u00a0(If you\u2019ve ever wanted to see what I look like when I\u2019m blogging, here\u2019s a picture.)  My mom is special because she washes the dishes.\u00a0 (Of all the things that could make me a special mom\u2026..this is it.)  HAPPY MOTHER\u2019S DAY!!!!!!!!
