My son C.J. lay in my arms all night. He cried until a restless sleep found him, then he whimpered rhythmically. If I moved away, he moved toward me so that our cheeks were touching. He hadn\u2019t slept in bed with me since he was six months old. He turned 11 on February 1. A week later, Allie, his \u201cschool best friend\u201d broke his heart. \u201cMy family doesn\u2019t hang out with gay people, so I\u2019m not going to hang out with you anymore,\u201d she told him as they walked together after school. C.J. didn\u2019t say anything. He was in shock and confused. The feeling of his heart breaking for the first time rendered him speechless. We\u2019ve known Allie\u2019s family casually for nine years, in the way you know a family when you raise children together in the suburbs. C.J. has gone to school with Allie for half his life. She\u2019s always known that he\u2019s a gender creative boy who like \u201cgirl things.\u201d It turns out, while Allie and her family had apparently been (at least somewhat) okay with C.J.\u2019s gender creativity, they aren\u2019t okay if he\u2019s gay. \u201cHow was school?\u201d I asked C.J. when he got in the car that afternoon. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. I could tell that nothing in his world was fine. We drove for a few minutes in silence until his pain came pouring out. It was too much for me to catch. \u201cShe just said it. She said her family doesn\u2019t hang out with gay people, so she can\u2019t hang out with me. She says I\u2019m the only gay person she knows, and she doesn\u2019t want to know me. She says that all of our friends will be her friends now because she is more popular than I am,\u201d he sobbed, with his head in hands. Tears dripped out from between his little fingers that were dirty from playing handball on the blacktop. At this point in his life, C.J. doesn\u2019t talk much about his sexual orientation. He\u2019s not yet a romantic or sexual being; he\u2019s an 11-year old boy with lots of time to figure out who he is attracted to while having our unconditional love and support. When he does talk about it, sometimes he says he\u2019s gay. Sometimes he says he\u2019s half gay and half bisexual. Sometimes he says, \u201cI\u2019m just me!\u201d Whatever his future sexuality, that day homophobia turned my son into devastation personified. Like all LGBTQ and gender expansive people, C.J. has learned to live life ignoring the stares, snickers and snide comments of strangers. He can brush off invasive questions and critiquing quips from classmates with a certain amount of ease. But, facing hostility from one of the most important people in his life \u2013 one of his best friends \u2013 was something he\u2019d never had to deal with. It put a gash in his heart that may never heal completely. I focused on driving even though it was the last thing I wanted to do.\u00a0I wanted to pull over and crawl into the back seat to comfort him. When we arrived home, Matt, my husband, was working in the garage and could tell right away that something was wrong. C.J. was all tears and unanswerable questions. \u201cAre Allie\u2019s parents homophobic?\u201d \u201cDo they hate gay people?\u201d \u201cDo they hate me?\u201d \u201cIf people are friends with me, can they still be popular?\u201d \u201cWho will I sit with at lunch?\u201d \u201cWho will I play with at recess?\u201d \u201cWhy do people hate people for something they can\u2019t change?\u201d My gut reaction was the desire to lash out. I wanted to send Allie\u2019s mom questioning texts. I wanted to point out Allie\u2019s flaws to C.J. and return the birthday present she handed him with a smile a few days earlier. I wanted to erase all the play dates they\u2019d had and the crafts they\u2019d made. I wanted to delete the pictures they took with Santa at Christmas time. I knew I wasn\u2019t thinking rationally with my brain; I was feeling with my heart. I reminded myself of the lesson we teach both of our sons: we can\u2019t let hate breed hate. That\u2019s easier said than done. C.J. doesn\u2019t feel shame about liking makeup or thinking boys are cute. Allie had seen more of that this school year. A few months ago, she was the first person outside of our family who C.J. told he might be gay. She was a little uncomfortable, but their friendship carried on. After the movie Wonder came out, they discovered they both had a crush on the male costar. Allie thought it was weird, but also totally understandable because the boy was so cute. I guess there had only been little hints of gay up until just before the big breakup. Then, Allie got in trouble when her parents caught her reading my blog about raising a gender creative child on her iPad. Days later, she attended C.J.\u2019s birthday party and there were gay people among the partygoers. During the party, C.J. randomly told her that he couldn\u2019t wait for OC Pride (our local Pride) and that she should go because Pride is so much fun. Either Allie decided she was too uncomfortable with C.J.\u2019s non-heteronormative identity to be friends with him or her parents made the decision for her, because the next day their friendship was over \u2014 but C.J.\u2019s physical and emotional pain had just begun. He climbed onto my lap like a small child. I held him and rocked him while thinking, \u201cThis is what hate does. This is what the effects of bigotry look like. A mother rocking her fifth grader because neither one knows what to do to ease the pain.\u201d We sat, sharing tears for nearly an hour with few words said. \u201cI love you so much\u201d I whispered over and over. \u201cI know,\u201d he whispered each time. \u201cIf I could take away the pain, I would.\u201d I said. \u201cI know. But you can\u2019t take away the gay,\u201d he said. I wished Allie and her parents could witness that moment. Would it prompt them to reconsider their phobias? Would they change their minds? Would they see that my tender-souled boy is a great person to have in their lives? Would they see that I\u2019m teaching my child to love while they\u2019re teaching their child to hate? C.J.\u2019s pain came in waves, like pain usually does. He\u2019d forget for a moment. He\u2019d tire for a minute. Then he\u2019d remember. The emotions would crest and break. At times, C.J. was inconsolable. I watched him shivering on the couch and struggling to catch his breath between sobs. This is one of the reasons why some LGBTQ and gender expansive kids kill themselves. This is why some of them sink into depression, turn to drugs, drop out of school and participate in unsafe sexual situations. This is why some mothers with children like mine find their arms empty one day. I worry that C.J. can\u2019t take this kind of pain and rejection for years on end. He can\u2019t have nights like this multiplied by seven more years of school and an infinite number of classmates who will hate him for who he loves and what he wears. We got him into the bath, telling him that a good soak would soothe him. Matt lay on the floor next to the bathtub so that C.J. would feel his presence and protection. Matt wiped away his own slow, silent tears when C.J. wasn\u2019t looking. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be alone, buddy. You\u2019re still going to have friends,\u201d Matt said before listing all of C.J. friends \u2013 excluding Allie. Matt and I didn\u2019t think Allie could persuade all of C.J.\u2019s friends to turn their back on him. Until now, all of his girl friends have always been fiercely loyal and protective. But, she\u2019d planted a seed of fear in our hearts we had never felt before. If Allie, who had once been one of C.J.\u2019s most loyal friends and protectors, could change her view of him seemingly overnight, I worried it might be possible that others could do the same. I suddenly found myself spiraling as I imagined Allie and her parents texting, emailing, facebooking, tweeting, snapchatting and facetiming every family in the school directory to turn them against our son because he might love a boy one day. Gossip and hate spread fast in the suburbs. I caught myself before the terrifying daydream could unravel any further. Rather than dwelling on worst-case scenarios, Matt and I decided to try to use the experience as a teachable moment. We reminded C.J. to treat others the way he wants to be treated and that the easiest way to rob haters of their power is to act like their actions don\u2019t bother you. C.J. asked if we could just go to bed and wake up\u00a0tomorrow. I agreed without hesitation. Sleep is often the answer. His mention of\u00a0the next day was a reminder that it would be the first day when he\u2019d have no friends at school, sit by himself at lunch and play by himself at recess. He pictured every day of the rest of his days being spent alone and hated, because Allie\u2019s family doesn\u2019t hang out with gay people, so Allie doesn\u2019t, so no one else will. \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt this bad forever. It\u2019s going to get better. I know that\u2019s hard to believe right now, but I promise,\u201d I said to C.J. in bed. \u201cYou have lots of friends. You are amazing and if people don\u2019t see that, they are the ones with the problem, not you. Kids should be lining up to have a unique friend like you.\u201d The next morning I drove C.J. to school slowly, in no hurry for him to leave the safety of my car. \u201cI love you. Have a good day,\u201d I said to him, as I do every morning. I watched him walk away from my car with his head hung low. It felt like my heart was walking off with him. I drove teary-eyed to work, thinking of the parents of rainbows who felt this pain before me and those who will feel it after me. I thought of the LGBTQ and gender expansive youth who have or will experience C.J.\u2019s pain and rejection without unconditional love and support at home. When I arrived at work, I looked in the rear-view mirror and wiped my eyes. I took a deep breath and walked into my office, ready to start the countdown to when I found out how C.J.\u2019s day at school went. Who would be friends with C.J.?
