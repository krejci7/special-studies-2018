We were discussing our children. Her kids are all in their 20s and her youngest is autistic. Family hike. #goodday She has read my book and blog and was talking about the similarities she sees in raising an autistic child and raising a gender nonconforming child. The stares. The judgments. The questions. The isolation. The impact on siblings. The self-doubt.\u00a0 The stress. The worry.\u00a0 The planning, predicting and protecting. She, like me, feels like she always has to be predicting and planning for the moments that come after the one that is happening.\u00a0 We\u2019re constantly trying to think one or two or seven steps ahead to avoid unpleasant people and uncomfortable scenarios. \u201cI hate that sometimes you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re having a good day until the day is over,\u201d she said. \u201cYou wish you had known when it was happening but you were too busy doing everything in your power to make it a good day \u2014 or at least not a bad day.\u201d She was absolutely right. I had never thought about it. Saw this dog on the way to dinner. #goodday At school, were worried about C.J. using the restroom privately and safely, were worried about him being bullied on the playground and we\u2019re worried that his teacher will continue to do activities divided by gender. At gymnastics we worry that someone will make fun of his painted toenails and long hair and make him want to quit a sport that he loves so much and has the potential to be really good at. On a recent weekend getaway we worried when we saw another child staring at C.J., then snicker, then walk up to him, look him up and down and \u2014 with a disgusted look \u2014 ask if he is a boy or a girl. Learning to knit. #goodday We spend so much time worrying, predicting, planning and protecting that often it\u2019s not until I\u2019m lying in bed at night \u2014 mapping out the next day \u2014 that I reflect and think to myself, \u201cToday was a good day. \u00a0Today was a great day. \u00a0We rocked today.\u00a0 I liked today.\u201d And that\u2019s a shame. I want to enjoy the day as we are living it. \u00a0I need to worry less. \u00a0That seems doable. I need to predict, plan and protect less. \u00a0I\u2019m afraid those habits will be hard to break.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been doing them every moment of every day for the past four years.\u00a0 It\u2019s become a way of life. \u201cI can\u2019t not be thinking of the ten scenarios that could happen ten steps ahead,\u201d I said to my neighbor. \u201cI know. It\u2019s what moms do when we have a child with special needs.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting.\u201d I said. \u00a0She agreed wholeheartedly. Our view at breakfast. #goodday I imagined how simple life would be if we didn\u2019t have to live like this, if we could realize as the day was happening that it was a good one. I\u2019ve been making a point to stop throughout the day and take inventory.\u00a0 Is it a good day?\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 They\u2019ve all been good days recently.\u00a0 What if a bad day happens?\u00a0 We\u2019ll deal with it then, so let\u2019s not worry about it now.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I tell myself.\u00a0 It\u2019s nice to hear.\u00a0 But it\u2019s easier said than done. \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
