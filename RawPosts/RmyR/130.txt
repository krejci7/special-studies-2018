This year\u2019s celebration took the cake; we may have peaked with his seventh birthday party. We spent the night before at our friend Marie\u2019s house in her RV in her backyard, which is one of C.J.\u2019s favorite things to do.\u00a0 He loves glamping.\u00a0 We woke up and walked across the backyard into the house where Matt and I prepared birthday cake pancakes.\u00a0 As with most things I get off of Pinterest, the results were sub-par.\u00a0 But, like a good mom will tell you, if the worst part of the day was pancakes that wouldn\u2019t cook all the way through, it\u2019s a good day. We took our time getting dressed and primped.\u00a0 C.J. had his outfit laid out for a week.\u00a0 He selected: his black Chuck Taylor All Stars, gray super skinny jeans, a pink-leopard-print skinny belt, a studded Monster High t-shirt and a pink oxford shirt.\u00a0 He decided not to chalk his hair because he was afraid it would detract from the birthday crown he knew he would be getting.\u00a0 He also dressed his American Girl doll, Julie, in a party outfit that he pulled together for her after much thought. All of the party goers loaded into Marie\u2019s van (thanks for driving, Marie!\u00a0 I still owe you gas money).\u00a0 C.J.\u00a0 Me.\u00a0 Marie.\u00a0 Marie\u2019s daughters Grace and Kate.\u00a0 My friend KK and her daughter Saige.\u00a0 And we were off\u2026.to the American Girl Place at The Grove in Los Angeles!!!!!!!! I had booked a 12:30 p.m. party in the American Girl Caf\u00e9.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know who was more excited: C.J., me, Marie, Grace or KK.\u00a0 Kate and Saige were trying to play it cool because they are 13 and 10 and way too cool for dolls, but they were excited deep down inside. When I called American Girl in December to make a reservation (it\u2019s a tough one to get), I was pleasantly surprised when the American Girl customer service rep asked, \u201cWhat is the birthday child\u2019s name?\u00a0 How old will the birthday child be turning?\u201d\u00a0 She didn\u2019t assume that the birthday child was a girl.\u00a0 I told her that the birthday child was a boy and there wasn\u2019t a moment\u2019s hesitation. \u201cDo you a lot of boys celebrate their birthdays at the American Girl Place?\u201d I asked because I\u2019m always curious. \u201cIt\u2019s not common, but it happens frequently,\u201d she replied, not skipping a beat. \u201cDo you do anything differently depending on whether the birthday child is a girl or a boy?\u201d I asked.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t.\u00a0 I was pleased, again.\u00a0 I like it when things seem easy. Uncle Michael and two of his friends met us at the American Girl Place.\u00a0 C.J. was given the pink, glittery birthday crown that he had been waiting (and not-hair-chalking) for.\u00a0 American Girl Julie also got a crown.\u00a0 And, they both got a sticker that said \u201cHappy Birthday!\u201d We were seated at our table for 10.\u00a0 This is where our crowd really went wild.\u00a0 Everybody who brought a doll got a high chair for their doll so that all dolls joined us at the table.\u00a0 If you didn\u2019t bring a doll, you could borrow one from the Caf\u00e9\u2019s shelves.\u00a0 C.J. had me borrow Ivy.\u00a0 She is Julie\u2019s BFF and he wanted the girls to be together at his party.\u00a0 But, he also wanted to spend some time with Isabelle, the 2014 American Girl of the Year.\u00a0 So, he let (made) Uncle Michael borrow Isabelle. So, there we were, 10 humans and six dolls.\u00a0 The server walked over to greet us and say happy birthday to C.J.\u00a0 Then, she said, \u201cWhat does the birthday girl want to drink?\u201d C.J. looked at me, wide eyed.\u00a0 I put my hand on his arm and said \u201cThe birthday boy would like an Arnold Palmer.\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d the server said. Out came our drinks and each doll got a tiny teacup and saucer.\u00a0 C.J. and Marie smiled and squealed.\u00a0 Out came our appetizers.\u00a0 All miniature foods.\u00a0 More smiles and squeals. The Caf\u00e9 manager approached our table. \u201cAre you the birthday girl?\u201d she asked C.J.\u00a0 He looked at me. \u201cHe\u2019s the birthday boy,\u201d I said.\u00a0 This was getting exhausting.\u00a0 I usually don\u2019t speak for him so often, but I wasn\u2019t going to let anything dampen his day. We ate.\u00a0 The dolls ate.\u00a0 The cake was placed in front of C.J. and we sang Happy Birthday.\u00a0 He leaned back, drew in a breath, his cheeks puffed out, be began to blow and, then, he stopped suddenly. \u201cOh, I need a minute, I didn\u2019t make a wish,\u201d he said with concern.\u00a0 Pink candles were melting onto the pink and white cake.\u00a0 I was fighting the urge to rush him.\u00a0 He must have come up with something, because he blew out the candles and we erupted in applause.\u00a0 My boy beamed. There\u2019s a holder for your doll in the bathroom stall so that she can watch you pee. Not weird at all. After lunch we entered the two-story American Girl Store and C.J. was more overwhelmed than I have ever seen him. \u00a0There was so much to look at and so much he wanted. We stopped by the doll hospital, where you could check your doll in for healing (repairs).\u00a0 We visited the doll salon where dolls were getting elaborate up-dos.\u00a0 Uncle Michael in particular was fascinated by this section of the store and snapping pics with his phone.\u00a0 Then, a moment that C.J. had been waiting for arrived.\u00a0 Julie got in line to get her ears pierced.\u00a0 You can watch your doll get her hair done, but you can\u2019t watch her get her ears pierced.\u00a0 I\u2019ve heard that\u2019s because they use a drill to make holes in her head and that would prove traumatizing for children.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t shared this information with C.J.\u00a0 I stood with him in the waiting area and when Julie was presented to us with small shiny stars in her ears, he was all happiness. Uncle Michael spoiled him with the American Girl gymnastics equipment set; KK and Saige bought him a skirt; Uncle Michael\u2019s friends bought him and Julie a white dog named Coconut; and I bought him a wheelchair for his doll.\u00a0 Presumably to use as she recovers from some injury incurred on the gymnastics set \u2013 although, once home, he put Julie in the wheelchair and pushed her down the stairs (more than once or 15 times). The American Girl Place was overwhelming for all of us and we weren\u2019t disappointed to leave after three hours. C.J. fell asleep in the car as we headed home to celebrate the big \u201c7\u201d with Matt, Chase and my parents.\u00a0 He continued to luck out in the gift department.\u00a0 He wanted Monster High dolls and Lego Friends sets\u2026and he got them. When I went to work on Monday morning a coworker asked me if everything went okay at the American Girl store and if people were staring at C.J. because he was a boy celebrating his birthday at doll store.\u00a0\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if people were staring at us, because I was staring at C.J.\u00a0 And the view was fabulous.
