What are your thoughts? Now for the winner of the first-ever Raising My Rainbow giveaway!\u00a0 I instructed those who wanted to be entered to leave a comment at the end of last Thursday\u2019s post.\u00a0 I received 44 comments.\u00a0 I wrote numbers one through 44 on a sheet of paper and had C.J. circle the number he liked best.\u00a0\u00a0 He circled the number five first (then 22 through 24, 28 and 29).\u00a0 So congrats to the following commenter, I must say, by his comment, he is VERY deserving! Greg (may 21,2001 at 6:43 p.m.) says: If I get picked I will donate the book to the high school Library where I am a teacher. we had an incident this week where a closeted student was harassing another student about being gay. I think this book will help both of them.  Hey, are you all aware that Queerty.com is back online and Raising My Rainbow is back on Queerty?\u00a0 Spread the word and check out the new Queerty. Have you found me on \u201cThe Facebook,\u201d as C.J.\u2019s Dad likes to call it?\u00a0 Facebook.com/RaisingMyRainbow.\u00a0 I\u2019m on the Tweet Machine too (/RaisingRainbow), but I Facebook more.\u00a0Additional tidbits on raising C.J. offered there, like when he put lip gloss in his hair and readers helped me find a solution to get it out.\u00a0 BTW, acetone and rubbing alcohol good, dry shampoo bad.
