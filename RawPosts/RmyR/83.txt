And, we\u2019re so glad we did because it was really great, respectful and educational. We didn\u2019t make a big announcement; we just turned on the television while they were in the room, like we often do. C.J. sat on the floor playing Lego Elves; Chase was in our over-sized chair playing his Nintendo 3DS. Born into a generation of multitaskers, they were each doing their own thing while listening to our thing. \u201cIs he transgender?\u201d they both asked as the show got underway. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. Maybe he\u2019ll tell us now,\u201d I said. As Matt and I watched, the boys gave half of their attention to Bruce and half to themselves. During the interview, ABC showed a Saturday Night Live clip poking fun at Bruce\u2019s gender expression. \u201cAwww, that wasn\u2019t nice!\u201d Chase said, not looking up from his game. When Bruce\u2019s sister was interviewed, she said she cried after Bruce first told her about his gender struggle. She said she didn\u2019t understand at first. \u201cWell you should understand it! It\u2019s your brother! It\u2019s your family!\u201d C.J. yelled at the TV. \u201cSometimes people don\u2019t understand, even family members and friends,\u201d Matt explained. Diane Sawyer and Bruce both said that Bruce will emerge as \u201cHer\u201d \u2013 expressing more or entirely as female \u2014 when the time feels right. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see her!\u201d C.J. exclaimed giddily. \u201cYeah, why is he not a girl yet?\u201d C.J. asked impatiently. \u201cBecause he\u2019s taking his time,\u201d Matt says. When the interview was almost over, C.J. looked up from his LEGOS and said very seriously\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m going to be a boy my whole life.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d Matt and I said in unison. \u201cBut, you know if doesn\u2019t matter to us if you are a boy or a girl. That we love you no matter what,\u201d I said. \u201cYeah, yeah, I know,\u201d he mumbled. Our unconditional, nonjudgmental, totally supportive love bores C.J. now. But, at least he knows it\u2019s there for him. When the interview was over we paused the TV. \u201cWhat are your final thoughts on that?\u201d I asked both of the boys. \u201cI wish he didn\u2019t have to wait to transition until he\u2019s so old,\u201d Chase said. \u201cI want a snack,\u201d C.J. said. And, with that, out teaching moment came to an end.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
