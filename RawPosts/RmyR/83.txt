Lately, their favorite way to pass time is to jump on our trampoline together. Even though C.J. would prefer to take turns performing mini choreographed gymnastics routines for each other, Chase more often than not convinces him to play \u201csuperheroes.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what all the game entails, but I do know that they each pick a superhero to portray. Chase is always Captain America and, because he is unfamiliar with mainstream superheroes, C.J. has made up his own. C.J. is Banana Man. Me: What are Banana Man\u2019s superpowers? C.J.: I can shoot bubblegums out of my mouth. And if I touch stuff my sticker power is activated and whatever I touch gets covered with stickers. And I can turn things rainbow colored. And I can have a Super Jump. Me: What\u2019s a Super Jump? C.J.: I jump really high and when I land on the ground people fall like they can\u2019t walk in high heels. Me: What outfit does Banana Man wear? C.J.: It changes every day. But sometimes I only wear underwear while fighting bad guys because I can\u2019t handle the pressure of picking out an outfit every day. Me: And who are these bad guys you fight? C.J.: Chase when he\u2019s Captain America, that\u2019s why it\u2019s okay if I\u2019m only in my underwear, because he\u2019s seen me in my underwear before. Me: What does Banana Man like to eat? C.J.: Cookies with milk and bananas and donuts and pickles. Me: What does Banana Man hate to eat? C.J.: Chicken and French fries and tires. Me: Well, that makes sense. C.J.: Maybe I\u2019ll pick out one outfit that Banana Man mostly wears so I don\u2019t have to feel pressured picking out a new outfit every day. Can you hold on a minute? Me: Sure. And, then he returned as Banana Man\u2026 Banana Man!   ", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
