Crafts will be made. Dress to dazzle.\u00a0 Sparkles, glitter, tutus and pink are encouraged. You be you. Have your people RSVP to C.J.\u2019s people. The invites are out for C.J.\u2019s sixth birthday party.\u00a0 If one wasn\u2019t hand-delivered to you, better luck next year. My sweet baby C.J. C.J. has been planning his outfit for the last four weeks and four months ago he started planning the actual event.\u00a0 He vacillated between another bounce house warehouse party (super easy) and going to Disneyland (super expense).\u00a0 Then, he wanted to go and create at Build-A-Bear Workshop and dine at Ruby\u2019s with two friends.\u00a0 Then he wanted five friends.\u00a0 Then he wanted eight friends.\u00a0 $75 bucks per bear times nine kids equals no way in hell. Ultimately, he decided that he wanted a small party at our house with Valentine\u2019s Day decorations.\u00a0 Doable.\u00a0 He wanted to do crafts with his best girl friends.\u00a0\u00a0 Doable.\u00a0\u00a0 He wanted everybody to wear pink tutus and dress up like \u201crock-star sassy fairy ballerina Harajuku girls.\u201d\u00a0 What does that even mean? We handmade invitations and agreed on an invite list. Grace, a friend since birth \u2013 She wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world and won\u2019t think twice about seeing C.J. dressed in his fabulous finest.\u00a0 She\u2019d actually be more caught off guard if she saw him looking totally and completely masculine. Girl Friend #1 from school \u2013 She\u2019s known C.J. for two years and knows that he likes girl stuff.\u00a0 She dresses to impress him every day at school.\u00a0 Her mom has informed me that if C.J. doesn\u2019t compliment her outfit she deems it unsuccessful. Girl Friend #2 from school \u2013 She asks C.J. to marry her on a weekly basis.\u00a0 He has reluctantly agreed.\u00a0 She writes him love letters crowded with hearts and drawings of the two of them holding hands \u2013 with him wearing pink.\u00a0 He has a hard time not touching her long blonde hair during story time.\u00a0 They\u2019ve known each other only since September. Girl Friend #3 from school \u2013 Another new friend who C.J. met when school started, she is a total character and makes me laugh every time I spend even a minute with her.\u00a0 I secretly want her to be C.J.\u2019s best friend because she is so animated and entertaining that she keeps me amused nonstop.\u00a0 Maybe I should just be best friends with her.\u00a0 \u00a0She has informed me that C.J. told her that he only likes girl stuff and she thinks that is great.\u00a0 At the same time, she told me that she thinks donuts are sweet. Lina, the new neighborhood friend \u2013 Lina has known C.J. for several months and only knows C.J. around our house and in the neighborhood, where his gender creativeness is on full, proud display \u2013 like when he runs in his heels better than Sarah Jessica Parker on Sex and the City or rides his purple scooter wearing a purple skirt and a red wig.\u00a0 Lina\u2019s family is from Lithuania and after meeting C.J. for the second time, they asked which pronouns he prefers.\u00a0 I almost cried tears of joy. So, three of the five girls see C.J. mostly at school where he presents himself totally as a boy. Should I inform their mothers that when the invite says \u201cDress to dazzle\u201d it means that everybody will be dazzling in glitter, pink, a tutu and who knows what else?\u00a0 I decided that I should.\u00a0 I had to warn the partygoers and their parents that the birthday boy would be dressed like girl.\u00a0 I would want the warning if the tables were turned and it could eliminate some teasing and awkwardness.\u00a0 It only seemed fair. But, I didn\u2019t want to deliver the warning with the kids in earshot.\u00a0 It\u2019s yet another way that sometimes I have to go ahead of C.J. and check the path, make sure it\u2019s safe and comfortable, without him knowing that sometimes his being gender creative can make life a bit more of a process. I told the mom of Girl Friend #1 from school.\u00a0 \u201cYeah, I figured,\u201d she said. I told the mom of Girl Friend #2 from school. \u00a0She smiled and seemed fine with it. \u00a0I got a text from her the next day letting me know that her daughter wouldn\u2019t be able to attend due to a scheduling conflict. I told the mom of Girl Friend #3 from school. \u201cReally?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes,\u201d I said and smiled. \u201cWell, isn\u2019t that fun?\u201d she said. \u201cGood, I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t mind,\u201d I said, pissed as the words exited my mouth like I was asking her permission. \u201cWell, if someone minds what your son wears, they have way too much time on their hands,\u201d she said.\u00a0 She\u2019s the oldest mom in the class (possibly a grandma turned mom) and I cherished her wisdom. \u201cAin\u2019t that the truth?\u201d I replied. This Saturday, C.J. \u2013 who looks \u201call boy\u201d at school \u2014 will open the door to his guests wearing a pink tutu from H&M and, from Target, pink metallic leggings, pink glitter legwarmers, purple bejeweled ballet flats and \u2013 the crowning glory \u2013 a black and white houndstooth, sequined sweater from Gwen Stefani\u2019s Harajuku Mini collection for kids.
