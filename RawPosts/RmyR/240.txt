Grandma Colorado:\u00a0 When he was about three years old. Mom:\u00a0 What was different about him? Grandma:\u00a0 He always had a lego person or a stuffed animal and always wanted to have a conversation with you with your toy.\u00a0 He would always say, \u201chow are you today, what do you want to do today.\u201d\u00a0 He always wanted to be the girl.\u00a0 I would say I\u2019m the girl and he would say I could be a girl or a boy but he was definitely the girl in our conversation. Mom:\u00a0 Did you think it was a phase at first? Grandma:\u00a0 I thought he was very bright and just showing individuality.\u00a0 He was always very independent. Mom:\u00a0 Did him playing with girl toys or dressing up like a girl ever bother you? Grandma:\u00a0 I thought it was unusual he wanted dolls only and girl toys.\u00a0 I guess I thought he would outgrow it.\u00a0 One of our friends had a neighbor boy who only played with the girls and loved the tea parties and such.\u00a0 He is now married with four children and very happy. One Christmas C.J. only received boy toys and he was devastated.\u00a0 Our son said it was the worst Christmas ever because C.J. was so angry at Santa and didn\u2019t get anything he wanted.\u00a0 Our son said that would never happen again.\u00a0\u00a0That really hit home with us.\u00a0 You don\u2019t want to deprive your children.\u00a0 The toys don\u2019t bother us.\u00a0 The dressing up was a little harder to accept.\u00a0 We worry more about how cruel other children can be.\u00a0 I\u2019m accepting of whatever my child or any other person wants to be. Mom:\u00a0 Do you or did you ever think we should make him conform? Grandma:\u00a0 C.J. will be whatever he will be.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think he has a choice.\u00a0 I think you guys have done a wonderful job with C.J. and his brother.\u00a0 We just want our children to be happy and well adjusted. Mom:\u00a0 Do you think he was born this way?\u00a0 Is it his nature or his nurture? Grandma:\u00a0 I definitely think he was born this way.\u00a0 I know many gay people who are happy and wonderful with lifetime partners.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think you would choose this lifestyle.\u00a0 There are too many ignorant and cruel people out there.\u00a0 I just worry about his safety and happiness.\u00a0 Children can be so cruel.\u00a0 You can see this already in C.J.\u2018s neighborhood. Mom:\u00a0 How has having a child like C.J. in the family changed you? Grandma:\u00a0 It has made be much more understanding and compassionate for children that don\u2019t fit society\u2019s mold.\u00a0 I feel I have always been very compassionate, but now I am more vocal about it.\u00a0 I stand up for the underdog.\u00a0 Like I said before I have a child in my charity organization that is very gender nonconforming.\u00a0 Now I always point out his pretty headbands and how unique and special he is. Mom:\u00a0 Do you feel like an unexpected advocate? Grandma:\u00a0 Most definitely.\u00a0 I am so proud of you as parents and his big brother.\u00a0 I feel Uncle Uncle has made a huge impact on my son over the years.\u00a0 He has helped make him more sensitive and understanding.\u00a0 My daughter-in-love has made a huge impact on our family and we are very blessed to have her in our family. Mom:\u00a0 What are your biggest fears for C.J., his brother and our family? Grandma:\u00a0 C.J. is a tiger, but a totally sensitive child.\u00a0 I worry for everyone when he goes to school.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want C.J.\u2019s spirit broken.\u00a0 I want him to be able to stand up to the bullies.\u00a0 I fear for his brother because he is so kind, gentle and an absolute sweetheart.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want him to have to change to protect his brother.\u00a0 I see this happening though and I see no way to change this.\u00a0 I see strong parents that are doing an incredible job.\u00a0 They have a difficult situation, but C.J. couldn\u2019t have better parents picked for this challenge.\u00a0 Our family is there to back you four up.\u00a0 We are all lions circling our cubs. Mom: \u00a0How were things for LGBTQ kids when you were working at the local high school? Grandma:\u00a0 The kids pretty well accepted them.\u00a0 I had an aide named B. who, as a senior, was fine and his family had finally accepted his sexuality.\u00a0 But, in his sophomore year he attempted suicide.\u00a0 As he tells it, it was a lame attempt, more of a plea to get his family to accept him as he was.\u00a0 Apparently it worked because his father was very accepting then and just glad he was alive. At the other school I transferred to,\u00a0 they had a large gay and lesbian group.\u00a0 They had meetings on campus and were very open about it.\u00a0 I think kids have become more accepting of it and not afraid.\u00a0 At least in the high school level. Mom:\u00a0 How do you think you would have parented a child like CJ? Grandma:\u00a0 Certainly not as well as you have.\u00a0 I think I would have been very confused.\u00a0 I probably would have blamed it on myself for my child being like this.\u00a0 I would have wondered what I had done wrong.\u00a0 It would have taken a while to accept.\u00a0 But, then you become supportive and just hope your child is not bullied and hurt along the way. Mom:\u00a0 What do you think C.J. will be when he grows up? Grandma:\u00a0 An artist, architect or engineer.\u00a0 He is so exacting and a perfectionist when he colors and draws.\u00a0 I am expecting great things from him.\u00a0 He is so dramatic and artistic he could be in theater also. Mom:\u00a0 What\u2019s your favorite thing to do with C.J.? Grandma:\u00a0 Run around and chase and scare him, draw with chalk, color, read to him, play dolls and hike (he has great stamina!). Mom:\u00a0 Anything else you want my blog readers to know? Grandma:\u00a0 In closing, I feel like my son and daughter-in-law have done a wonderful job with both of their children.\u00a0 They are lucky to have Uncle Uncle who can share and prepare them for what he has gone through.\u00a0 They have a supportive family that wants to love, share, help and see their family grow to their highest potential for each individual.\u00a0 We fear for the ignorant people out there who are terrified of anything different.\u00a0 We have two beautiful and totally unique grandchildren.\u00a0 We want their safety, happiness and them to be whatever they want to be.
