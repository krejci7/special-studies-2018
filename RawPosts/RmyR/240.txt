And HAPPY! I like his skirt!\u201d C.J. said pointing to the restaurant\u2019s statue of Buddha that was as tall as he is. C.J. put his arm around Buddha like they were best buddies George Clooney and Brad Pitt goofing for photographers on the red carpet. I gave C.J. a look and he backed away from Buddha. A lady in the waiting area giggled. \u00a0C.J. shot her a knowing smile as if to say, \u201cyeah lady, you know what\u2019s up.\u201d (Two minutes later) \u201cC.J., sit down and stop touching your Mom\u2019s earrings, please,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad said from across the table as he perused the menu. (Two minutes later) \u201cC.J., get out from under the table and sit down. Fine, get Abby Cadabby off of the floor and then sit down,\u201d said C.J\u2019s Dad. (Two minutes later) \u201cC.J. put your lip gloss back in your purse and sit down,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad said. (Two minutes later) \u201cC.J., just stay out of your purse, please, and sit down,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad said. The server approached our table to take our drink order. \u201cDo you have lemonade?\u201d C.J. asked. \u201cOhhhhhh, pink lemonade? Dat\u2019s my favorite because pink is my favorite color. I\u2019ll have dat.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll have a Tsingsao beer, please,\u201d said C.J.\u2019s Dad. \u201cYes. Tsingsao,\u201d the Chinese server said in his heavily affected broken English. \u201cSING SOW!\u201d C.J. said in his best Chinese, five-year-old affected English. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, get your son under control!\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad said to me, his Irish eyes smiling and his fair-skinned face turning red. \u201cSING SOW!\u201d C.J. said out loud again, liking the sound of it. \u201cIt\u2019s like being with a drunk, 21-year-old girl 24/7,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad whispered across the table to me. \u00a0I had to agree. Sometimes that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s like. This is the outfit that C.J. put together for our \"Hot Date.\" C.J. was a little hyper and out of sorts that night, but it was due to excitement, I can promise you that. His brother was at a sleepover, so C.J. had us all to himself. Instead of staying home to eat, we told C.J. that the three of us would go out on a date. \u201cA HOT date?!\u201d he asked as we were at home deciding where to eat. I should have known then the kind of mood he was in and considered staying home. When my hubby and I have a date night he always tells the boys that he is taking mommy out on a \u201chot date,\u201d so, naturally, C.J. expected that our date night would be nothing short of hot. We let him pick the restaurant. \u201cChinese!\u201d It\u2019s his favorite. The combination of not having to share our attention with his brother, being out on a \u201cHot Date\u201d and getting to pick the restaurant, had him intoxicated with joy and power. A lethal combo when it comes to kids. In his mind, the night was young and it could go anywhere, it was full of potential. Perhaps he\u2019d get to eat more than one fortune cookie, maybe we\u2019d stay out late and miss bath time, maybe we\u2019d forget to make him brush his teeth. The night was drunk on Tsingsao beer with possibilities. C.J. slid out of his seat while his father and I were discussing our days. He stood next to our booth in the aisle, put his hands on his hips and proceeded to drop it like it\u2019s hot. The kids at the next booth laughed. My husband\u2019s face flushed and I bit my lips to stop giggles from making a necessary exit. \u201cSeriously woman, get control of your son!\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad said to me. Guilty as charged. Sometimes I let C.J. hold on a little too tightly to his confidence and bravado because I feel like he needs it or will need it when dealing with haters in life. You need those two things (among other things) when you are growing up gender nonconforming and are among the youngest members of the LGBTQ community. But, I also don\u2019t want my child to be poorly behaved. We are working on finding a balance. \u201cC.J. baby, we don\u2019t drop it like it\u2019s hot in restaurants,\u201d I said with a smile as I pulled him into the booth and gave him a hug. His dad glared at both of us and, then, smiled. Two Easter baskets for two boys. Which one is C.J.'s? Hope you had a nice Easter! We got quiet as we waited for our food to arrive and hoped C.J. would pull it together long enough for us eat, pay and leave (our version of Eat, Pray, Love). \u201cSING SOW!\u201d It came out of nowhere. C.J.\u2019s Dad shot me a look and I stifled a giggle. Now I was feeling drunk and all I was sipping on was my good friend Arnold Palmer. C.J.\u2019s Dad started talking about a case he was dealing with at work and was explaining how he arrested a guy. \u201cOh no you didn\u2019t girlfriend!\u201d C.J. said loudly with a flick of the wrist and a snap. Our food arrived. C.J. shoved fried rice into his mouth with his spoon and, when that became too laborious, he used his dirty little fingers which were stained from the day\u2019s art projects. We were driving home and relishing in the quiet of the car. \u201cSING SOW!\u201d C.J. shouted from the back seat with such enthusiasm that the contents of his purse dumped onto the floor of the car. \u201cOh my!\u201d he exclaimed. Twenty-one-year-old drunk girl indeed.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 24 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
