Then he started doing my wife\u2019s makeup regularly, so I figured it was inevitable that I would be his next victim. A couple of years ago, C.J. asked if I would allow him to do my makeup. Of course I said yes. Why wouldn\u2019t I? Why wouldn\u2019t I want to be a part of something that brings joy to my son\u2019s life? If I said no to something as trivial as allowing him to paint my face, what would I be teaching him? I\u2019d be teaching him that playing dress-up or giving his dad a makeover is something to be ashamed of or something to hide. I don\u2019t want to teach him that. I want to teach him that his dad wants to spend time with him no matter what we\u2019re doing. I want him to know that even though I\u2019m not interested in makeup or fashion, I will play along as long as I get to sit and talk with him. While he\u2019s doing my makeup, he talks about everything. From what\u2019s going on at school to which eye shadow brings out my blue eyes. When I agree wholeheartedly as he discusses what makeup colors go with my skin tone, I\u2019m teaching him that his opinions and tastes matter to me. I\u2019m teaching him that I\u2019ll listen to him when he wants to talk and I will find time for him even when I\u2019m busy. My son doing my makeup is the same as a dad throwing a football with his son. It\u2019s not about what you are doing together; it\u2019s about doing it together. It\u2019s about encouraging your children to engage with you. It\u2019s about spending time with your child doing something they enjoy doing. Allowing your children to be themselves is very important. There are activities I do with Chase that I don\u2019t do with C.J. because they aren\u2019t fun for him. There are activities I do with C.J. that Chase doesn\u2019t want to do. And, there are activities we all do together. Spending quality time with each of my sons helps strengthen my relationship with them. When C.J. does my makeup, it makes me feel like I\u2019m experiencing something with him that he loves doing. It makes me feel like maybe I\u2019m encouraging and empowering him to have fun with something that may end up being his career as an adult. Or, it\u2019s just something we can do together that shows him that his dad loves spending time with him no matter what we are doing. He loves doing my makeup because he can make me look silly or dramatic and it cracks him up. Sometimes he takes it very serious, like he is really trying to make me look good. Other times it\u2019s more of a face painting exercise than anything. Either way, he loves doing it and I love being a part of some type of activity that my son loves doing.
