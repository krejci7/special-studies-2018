Last year we celebrated with lunch, shopping and pierced ears for his doll at the American Girl store in Los Angeles. How does he plan to top that? By having his eighth birthday party at a wig and hairpiece store. We were at the mall when he shouted, \u201cI\u2019m going to have my birthday party there!!!\u201d When I whipped my head around, I saw him pointing to Pauls Products \u2013 which serves the nearby retirement community, with its population of 16,000 and median age of 78 years. \u201cTake my picture in front of it and send it to Uncle Michael!\u201d he said as he posed by the store with a hundred well-coiffed heads. When C.J. thinks something is so fabulous that I can\u2019t possibly appreciate it, he has me take a picture of it and text it to my brother. I did as I was told.  \u201cNow, let\u2019s go tell them I want to have my birthday party there,\u201d he said, swiftly turning on a heel. \u201cYour birthday is six months away. We don\u2019t need to go in there today. We have some time,\u201d I said stalling. I hoped he would forget about Pauls Products and move on to the next great birthday party idea. What kid has their birthday party at a wig store? \u201cBut, I don\u2019t want them to get all booked up,\u201d he worried. \u201cThat\u2019s not the kind of place that usually hosts birthday parties,\u201d I said. \u201cThey will if you ask them. Let\u2019s go see,\u201d he said, ever hopeful. \u201cI\u2019m not going in there. It\u2019s creepy,\u201d Chase said. C.J. looked at me and I could tell he wasn\u2019t going to take no for an answer. \u201cIf we do go in there for your birthday, we won\u2019t be able to take a lot of people.\u201d I was trying to manage expectations without killing hope. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I just want Uncle Michael. Cause I know he\u2019ll like it. \u00a0Oh, and Grace. Cause she\u2019ll like it too. And Grace\u2019s Mom cause somebody has to drive Grace.\u201d He was counting his guests and held up his fingers to show me that that was only four people. I guess I wasn\u2019t invited. \u201cI\u2019m gonna try on so many wigs. And I\u2019m going to buy one,\u201d he continued. Shit. I guessed the wigs are really expensive because they looked very nice; not $15, like the chunky, rough ones he loves to get from the costume store before Halloween. \u201cIf I get the wig, I get to keep the head right?\u201d he asked. \u201cOh god, I hope not!\u201d Chase said instinctively. \u201cNo you don\u2019t get to keep the head,\u201d I said, like I knew what I was talking about. \u201cThank god,\u201d Chase said.  I tried explaining that the wigs were meant to be for people losing their hair due to medical reasons or age and that they weren\u2019t just for dressing up and playing around in. \u201cBut wigs are for everyone,\u201d he argued. He was using my own words against me. I\u2019m always saying everything is for everyone. Colors, skirts, dolls, wigs. C.J. reluctantly followed Chase and me away from Pauls Products and to the car. He kept talking about the wigs and his birthday party. \u201cMaybe Uncle Michael knows of a wig shop in Hollywood where we can go instead,\u201d I offered. Wondering where my brother\u2019s actor, performer and drag queen friends get their wigs and hairpieces. \u201cDo they host birthday parties at Uncle Michael\u2019s Hollywood wig stores?\u201d CJ asked. I told him I\u2019d check into it when we got back from vacation. Two weeks later, as we walked through the front door after seven hours on airplanes and in airports, C.J. reminded me to start looking into wig stores for his birthday party.  As I looked up the number for Pauls Products, I wondered how many other mothers had to do this for their sons. I called Pauls Products, feeling guilty for taking up the wig store worker\u2019s time when they could be helping someone who legitimately needed a wig. \u201cHi, would I need an appointment to try on wigs at your store?\u201d I asked very sweetly. \u201cNo, but you have to pay five dollars for every wig you try on,\u201d the Pauls Products employee answered. \u201cDo you allow children to try on wigs?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d I was quiet, thinking about the pediatric cancer patients who may be in need of a wig, but couldn\u2019t get one at Pauls Products. I was silently feeling sad for them. \u201cOkay. Kids can try on wigs, too,\u201d they said. \u201cBut, it\u2019s still five dollars per wig.\u201d They didn\u2019t seem thrilled about having kids in their shop. I couldn\u2019t blame them.
