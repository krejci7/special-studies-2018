Thanks for all of the bday wishes! Molly is a cutie.\u00a0 She is five and one of C.J.\u2019s BFFs at school, where they have bonded over their love of Rapunzel and the color purple (the hue, not the novel/film/musical).\u00a0 Molly has thick, brown curly hair and a perma-grin.\u00a0 Her happy eyes are always alive and looking for fun. \u00a0She is sweet, the first to notice if one of her friends is hurt or sad.\u00a0 She\u2019ll comfort anybody.\u00a0 She reminds me of one of the Precious Moments figurines that my grandmother collected when I was young. It made me pause when I saw her at C.J.\u2019s birthday party looking troubled.\u00a0 She sat with worried eyes that I didn\u2019t know she owned.\u00a0 Chin in hand, bottom lip protruding.\u00a0 The kids were all sitting at tables waiting for the cupcakes to be served.\u00a0 C.J. was sitting across from her.\u00a0 I moved in a little closer to eavesdrop. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about your present, C.J.,\u201d I heard her say to the birthday boy. \u201cWhy?\u201d C.J. asked, only giving her half of his attention. \u201cI\u2019m just so shy about it,\u201d she continued.\u00a0 By shy, she meant embarrassed.\u00a0 Girlfriend had really been giving this issue some serious thought. \u201cMy Mommy bought your present while I was at school and she doesn\u2019t know that you like girl toys.\u00a0 I thought she knew,\u201d Molly said shaking her head in disappointment. Huge props go to C.J.'s Dad who handmade 20 Monster High cupcake toppers for the party! \u201cYour Mommy thinks I like boy toys? Oh my gosh!\u201d C.J. said, giving Molly his full attention upon realizing that they were discussing the birthday gifts that he had been waiting 364 days to receive and open. \u201cI told her before about you liking girl stuff but then she bought you a SpongeBob book and a Toy Story puzzle.\u00a0 I\u2019m so shy (embarrassed),\u201d Molly explained, telling C.J. exactly what she got him for his birthday before gift unwrapping even took place.\u00a0 A cupcake appeared in front of each child. C.J. got sidetracked with eating his cupcake.\u00a0 Thank goodness because who knows what he would have said in reply to being informed that he was getting a SpongeBob SquarePants book and Toy Story puzzle.\u00a0 He isn\u2019t always good at things like manners, considering the feelings of others and being gracious.\u00a0 He\u2019s five.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on it.\u00a0 The chances of him saying, \u201cOh, that\u2019s okay Molly, it\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d were slim to none.\u00a0 I know my son.\u00a0 He can be a bit narcissistic. Nana Grab Bags made this cake for C.J.'s family birthday dinner. Uncle Uncle was jealous. There was a Beyblade in his Christmas stocking.\u00a0 He saw it and said with annoyance \u201cwhy would Santa give me a Beyblade?\u201d and promptly hurled it across the room at the Christmas tree. \u00a0While Uncle Uncle tried to hide his elfish laughter behind his mug of spiked eggnog, I crossed the room, retrieved the Beyblade, showed it to C.J. and explained to him that it was a pink Beyblade and that maybe Santa gave it to him so that he could Beyblade battle with his brother and the neighbor kids.\u00a0 Then, and only then, did C.J. consider forgiving Santa. For the past two and a half, gender nonconforming years, we\u2019ve had problems with gifts and C.J. because:  C.J. likes toys specifically marketed to girls and sometimes people don\u2019t know that or aren\u2019t comfortable with giving him \u201cgirl toys.\u201d\u00a0 And, as he gets older, the formerly safe \u201cgender neutral toys\u201d really piss him off. C.J. seems to have an inability to fake happiness and thankfulness when opening a gift that he doesn\u2019t like. He is a spitfire.\u00a0 If he doesn\u2019t like something, he\u2019s gonna make it known.\u00a0 Since Christmas, if he opens a \u201cboy toy\u201d we all duck.  Before his party, one mom asked me what she should buy C.J. for his birthday.\u00a0 I had my response down. \u201cAnything that you would get for a five-year-old girl,\u201d I replied honestly, owning his gender nonconformity much more than I had in the past when asked \u201cwhat gifts you will love?\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019ve come a long way in a year.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care about what other people think.\u00a0 I care about my son getting gifts that he likes, if he is lucky enough to be getting gifts. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes, and if you aren\u2019t comfortable with that, he loves to do crafts or anything artistic.\u201d C.J.'s fav bday gifts included these Monster High bunk beds, a Smurfette doll and Lego Friends sets. Three days later, at his birthday party, her child gave C.J. a genderless craft kit, which was fine, none of us had to duck.\u00a0 And that book and puzzle that Molly gave him?\u00a0 The Toy Story puzzle at Jessie and the purple Lotso Bear front and center, so all was right in his world.
