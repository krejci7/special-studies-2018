 A few months ago, we spent the day with Chelsea Handler talking about parenting, gender and what it’s like raising a gender nonconforming child. See some of our time together on the latest episode of her Netflix show Chelsea (Season 1, Episode 10). It’s all about adventures in parenting. She made us laugh, we made her dinner, Chase flirted with her and C.J. called her a racist. You know, the usual. Click here for full episode.   Don’t have Netflix?
