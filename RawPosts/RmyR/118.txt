 On Thursday (April 10), The Center School in Greenfield, Massachusetts, has invited me to speak about parenting, teaching and promoting advocacy for differently gendered children.   The event begins at 7 p.m. at Smith College and it’s FREE!  If you’re in the area, you should attend and introduce yourself.  I’d love to meet you.  For real.  Bring your book and I’ll sign it.  Don’t have my book yet? Never fear, there will be copies on hand for purchase.  Click on the image above to go to The Center School’s website. I wish my kids could attend The Center School, which is a progressive, independent day school that fosters a balance of social consciousness and self-awareness in an environment where children are encouraged to be independent and resourceful.   It is the academic home to young deep thinkers and creative spirits.  I can’t wait to visit.  I love deep thinkers and creative spirits! * * * Are you a fellow Orange Countian?  Tomorrow at 11:20 a.m. in Irvine, I’ll be speaking on a panel of memoirists at Literary Orange 2014.  Should I save you a seat?
