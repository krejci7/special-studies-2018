Look at those lashes and pretty pink lips! This year on a trip to the mall, as we approached Santa in the center court, C.J. started to, simultaneously, pull away from me and hide behind me.\u00a0 He ran in a circle around me as I ran in a circle around him, each of us trying to grab the other. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see Santa!\u00a0 I want to see Mrs. Claus and the reindeer,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cOkay, okay, we aren\u2019t going to see Santa today.\u201d \u201cI want to see Mrs. Claus and sit on HER lap and tell HER what I want,\u201d C.J. insisted. Great.\u00a0 Where was I going to find a place where C.J. could sit on Mrs. Claus\u2019s lap?\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s Mrs. Claus,\u201d I said pointing to Santa\u2019s photographer who just might have been too big for the customary elf costume and was, therefore, relegated to the role of Mrs. Claus;\u00a0 which is the role I would have wanted anyway because, one would assume, that it comes with a little more respect and right to authority.\u00a0 But, really, what do I know about the inner workings of the Mall Claus-to-elf employment org chart. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look like Mrs. Claus.\u00a0 She\u2019s not old enough.\u00a0 Where are the reindeer?,\u201d C.J. asked. \u201cThey must be parked out by Nordstrom Rack,\u201d I mumbled, as we cut through J.C. Penny\u2019s to get to our car.\u00a0 A few days later, our family of four was at Knott\u2019s Berry Farm. \u00a0Bless their berry souls for letting police and fire families in free between Thanksgiving and Jan. 31.\u00a0 My intention was to get the boys\u2019 picture taken with Santa at Knott\u2019s.\u00a0 When my oldest son was younger \u2014 before C.J. made his grand entrance with a flourish into our lives \u2014 I considered myself a connoisseur of Santas and, so, I know that Santa at Knott\u2019s is as close to the real deal as you\u2019re going to get.\u00a0 We walked into his workshop, which was filled with toy souvenirs to buy, and C.J. quickly realized what was going on.\u00a0 He began to wring his hands, which is what he always does when he is getting nervous and unsure.\u00a0 But, he also knew that if he was going to tell Mr. Claus what he wanted for Christmas, now was the time.\u00a0 The countdown to the 25th was in full swing, he knew this because most of the chocolates were gone from his advent calendar.\u00a0 C.J.'s souvenir from Knott's. He's got a thing for Lucy lately, C.J.\u2019s Brother hopped right into Santa\u2019s sleigh to shoot the shit for a while.\u00a0 His legs were outstretched and crossed at the ankles; he had one arm up on the side of the sleigh and was chatting up Santa about Bey Blades, video games and Percy Jackson.\u00a0 C.J. would not enter the sleigh.\u00a0 So he sat on the steps to the sleigh.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t look at Santa.\u00a0 Santa leaned across the sleigh, across C.J.\u2019s Brother and tapped C.J.\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0 \u201cWhat do you want for Christmas little boy?,\u201d he said jollily. \u201cMama, what do I want for Christmas?,\u201d C.J. looked at me helplessly.\u00a0 He froze.\u00a0 Like I would if I came face to face Tina Fey or a grizzly bear. \u201cHow about anything Disney Princess?,\u201d I offered.\u00a0 Funny, at that point I was more concerned with helping my son capitalize on his big moment than what Santa would think about my boy wanting a girl toy.\u00a0 Things have really changed in a year. \u201cYeah, ANYTHING Disney Princess,\u201d C.J. said with a big smile. \u201cAlright!,\u201d Santa said assuredly as he gave C.J. a high five.\u00a0 The flash snapped and we walked away. C.J. wasn\u2019t specific with Santa, but he sure was with me.\u00a0 In the form of a list that is two pages long.\u00a0 Single spaced.\u00a0 His brother\u2019s list took up a mere half a page.\u00a0 The Top Seven Things C.J. Wants for Christmas:  Barbie Princess Charm School Princess Doll (her outfit magically transforms into three different fashionable looks!) All the Monster High Dolls Everything and anything Disney Princess Fisher Price Doodle Bear Pink or purple razor scooter (because he\u2019s so rad that now he scoots on two wheels, not three) A jean\u00a0skirt for his dress up bin Hot Wheel\u2019s wall tracks (which really threw us for a loop)  The Top Seven Things C.J.\u2019s Brother Wants for Christmas:  Xbox Kinect TV Cell phone Bike Backpack with only one cross-body strap (because \u201cthe new kid in his class who just moved here from Chicago has one and it looks really cool\u201d) Dictionary Rock tumbler Microscope  My sweet angel... On his last day of school before Winter Break, C.J. took part in his pre-K class\u2019s Holiday Recital.\u00a0 He was so excited because all of the kids \u2013 boy and girls \u2014 got to be angels and wear white dresses/gowns that they made themselves from white pillowcases. I talked to Ms. Sensible after the performance and let her know how happy C.J. was because all of the kids dressed the same and got to wear dresses.\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t think that that as a well thought out decision this year?,\u201d she asked with a wink. I hope Santa is good to Ms. Sensible this Christmas. \u00a0And, I hope he\u2019s good to all of you, because you\u2019ve been amazing to us this year. I\u2019m planning on taking a blogging-vacay from here until 2012.\u00a0 I\u2019ll see you when I return, right?\u00a0 \u00a0Cheers!   ", "feedtitle": "Page 26 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
