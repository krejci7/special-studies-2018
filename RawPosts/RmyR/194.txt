I was in fifth grade.\u00a0 I boarded the school bus and a sixth grade girl asked me if I was virgin. \u201cNo,\u201d I said giving her a dirty look and finding a seat.\u00a0 That sounded like a terrible thing to be. \u201cYes you are.\u00a0 Virgin!\u201d she said rudely. I ignored her.\u00a0 After dinner I told my mom that a girl at school called me a virgin.\u00a0 She took a deep breath. \u201cWell, honey, you are one.\u201d\u00a0 And, right then and there, I got the sex talk.\u00a0 I walked to my bed with slumped shoulders and cried myself to sleep.\u00a0 Men\u2019s penises get hard and they stick them in women\u2019s vaginas.\u00a0 Someday a man was going to stick his penis in my vagina.\u00a0 What a nightmare. The next day my mom left a book about puberty and sex on my bed.\u00a0 I was grossed out and humiliated. Our oldest son is getting ready to turn 10.\u00a0 He\u2019s been asking some questions that have us feeling like the first of many puberty and sex talks may be coming in the year ahead.\u00a0 Which got me thinking. One big, fat sperm chilling out\u2026waiting for an erection. I can\u2019t remember the first time that I assumed it because I\u2019ve assumed it for so many years now.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always assumed that, because we have two boys, my husband would take on the brunt of the responsibility when it comes to detailed discussions of puberty and sex.\u00a0 We\u2019d be absolutely open and honest about puberty and sex discuss them freely as needed, but certain discussions are heavy \u2013 C.J.\u2019s Dad would lift those.\u00a0 If we had had girls, it would have been my job. \u201cWho gives the boys the sex talk?\u201d I asked C.J.\u2019s Dad out of the blue \u2013 like I ask most questions. \u201cI do,\u201d he said without hesitation. \u201cWhat if one of them is gay?\u201d I asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never thought about that.\u201d\u00a0 He paused.\u00a0 And, paused.\u00a0 And, paused.\u00a0 \u201cI have to admit, you\u2019re blowing my mind a little right now,\u201d he answered honestly. This, my friends, is what a wet dream looks like. It\u2019s the same for our close friends with kids; the same-sex parent does the majority of the puberty and sex talking.\u00a0 And, the majority of the sex talking involves the details of heterosexual sex. \u00a0Mine did \u2013 rightly so.\u00a0 My brother\u2019s did \u2013 epic fail. The puberty and sex talks seem to be all about procreation, not about having sex because it\u2019s enjoyable or because it\u2019s what you do in a committed relationship or to bond with your partner.\u00a0 And, if you\u2019re talking about procreation, you\u2019re talking about a man and a woman.\u00a0 The sex talk needs to be different for gay children, right? \u201cSay C.J. is gay\u2026I guess we give him both sex talks,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad said after a while. \u201cSo, if his brother is straight, are you going to give him both sex talks?\u201d I asked.\u00a0 \u201cThat only seems fair.\u201d \u201cUgh!\u00a0 My parents didn\u2019t even have any puberty or sex talks with me.\u00a0 I figured it out on my own.\u00a0 Can\u2019t they just do that?\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad asked entirely frustrated. \u201cNo!\u00a0 They need to know about safe sex and being responsible and respectful and all that crap,\u201d I argued. This poor lad has been caught in the act. To be honest, if one of my son\u2019s is gay, it just seems like I should be the one to give the sex talks.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know why.\u00a0 But I think that we need to be careful with both of the boys that as we start to discuss these things we are mindful not to make assumptions about their sexuality.\u00a0 No stigma.\u00a0 No shame.\u00a0 No secrets. But we still have to educate them about STDAware tests for chlamydia everything else more unpleasant. Thankfully we have plenty of time to think about it.\u00a0 Because, as with so many things about raising kids in general and raising a gender nonconforming child in particular, we have no idea what we are doing. * * * Disclaimer: I know that not all households have a father and mother present.\u00a0 If I were the only parent/primary caregiver in our home, I would give the sex talk to both boys (or both girls, if we had them.\u00a0 Or, to any number of children in any combination of sex/gender). \u00a0C.J.\u2019s Dad and I realize that our assumptions hadn\u2019t been based on a lot of thought. \u00a0We assumed them; we didn\u2019t think about them prior to getting inspired to write this post. \u00a0\u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
