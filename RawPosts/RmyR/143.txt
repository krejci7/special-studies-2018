Last week, in his first grade classroom, he peed his pants.\u00a0 He sat in his urine until the dismissal bell rang.\u00a0 His pants were soaked and cold when he got out of school.\u00a0 He was uncomfortable and he smelled.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want anybody to know.\u00a0 It was his secret. He started crying in the car. \u201cI\u2019m so ashamed of myself,\u201d he said over and over again.\u00a0 Tears rolled down his face, even though he willed them not to.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t hold them back. Come to find out, my son \u2014 with his long auburn hair, pink and purple fitted clothes, feminine backpack and wrist full of rainbow-colored loom bracelets \u2013 is terrified to use the boys\u2019 bathroom at school. On his first visit to the boys\u2019 bathroom, he headed straight for the safety of the stall.\u00a0 Boys started peeking through the cracks in the stall to see if he was going pee or poop.\u00a0 Pooping at school is an embarrassment.\u00a0 He avoided the bathroom for as long as he could.\u00a0 The next time he had to go, he, again, walked straight to the stall.\u00a0 He locked the door behind him.\u00a0 He lifted the toilet seat lid and unzipped his pants.\u00a0 He could hear them talking.\u00a0 He could hear them looking.\u00a0 He turned around.\u00a0 Boys were peeking through cracks again.\u00a0 This time they were trying to see his genitals.\u00a0 They wanted to know if my son has a penis or a vagina. My son refuses to go into the boys\u2019 bathroom again.\u00a0 He has stopped drinking his juice boxes at lunch.\u00a0 He refuses to drink anything at breakfast.\u00a0 He\u2019ll do anything to not have to use the boys\u2019 bathroom at school.\u00a0 He\u2019ll do anything to avoid having strangers look at his private parts while taking bets as to what they\u2019ll see when they get to see something. I\u2019m sure you can understand why my son is not comfortable using the boys\u2019 restroom at school.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t be comfortable using the girls\u2019 restroom either.\u00a0 Because he identifies as male, the girls\u2019 bathroom doesn\u2019t feel like the place for him. He wants to use the boys\u2019 bathroom, it\u2019s just that he wants to feel safe once he crosses the threshold into a domain that is loud, messy and run by the boys who dominate the playground.\u00a0 It\u2019s a world where adults are not allowed and one where being different or weak makes you a target. We have a \u201cfemale campus,\u201d which means that our principal and vice principal are female.\u00a0 I\u2019m told that it\u2019s against the law for them to enter the boys\u2019 restroom.\u00a0 It\u2019s the only place on campus where the kids have free reign.\u00a0 They know that adults can\u2019t enter.\u00a0 It\u2019s like Lord of the Flies in there.\u00a0 An island of urine, screams, voyeurism and soaking wet paper towels thrown onto the ceiling and hanging down like dirty icicles.\u00a0 It\u2019s aggressive; my son is not. My son has been given the option to use the nurse\u2019s bathroom in the school\u2019s front office.\u00a0 To a first grader at one of the largest elementary school campuses in Orange County, the nurse\u2019s office feels like it\u2019s miles away.\u00a0 When he does use that restroom, the other kids ask him why.\u00a0 He feels weird no matter where he pees. So, instead, he holds his bladder from 7:40 am. To 2:30 p.m., except for on days like the other day, when he could hold it no longer. After getting emotional and feeling blue about raising a boy who only likes pink, I contacted the school.\u00a0 I wiped my own tears and set out to fight his battles, clear his path and ensure that my son would be safe and comfortable at school.\u00a0 I feel like I\u2019m the only mother who has to fight for her son\u2019s rights to toilet in privacy, without others trying to get a good look at what\u2019s between his legs. \u201cOf course you should talk to the school,\u201d my brother said.\u00a0 \u201cBut, you need to teach him to stand up for himself if he doesn\u2019t like what\u2019s happening to him.\u201d I had been operating in crisis mode.\u00a0 I had been so focused on handling the problem for him, that I was forgetting to teach him how to handle it on his own. We role-played. \u201cStop looking at my privates.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re being rude.\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop, I\u2019m going to tell.\u201d \u201cHow would you like it if someone was watching you go to the bathroom?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be gross.\u201d \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is not okay.\u201d \u201cSTOP IT!\u201d It doesn\u2019t feel like enough.\u00a0 It\u2019s not enough.\u00a0 But at least now, my son knows what to say to try to defend and protect himself. I talked to my mom about it.\u00a0 Weeks ago she left her bible study in tears.\u00a0 A fellow church-going Christian claimed to have insider information and knew that my son was using the girls\u2019 bathroom at school.\u00a0 There would be hell to pay when \u201ceverybody else\u201d found out about it. My son isn\u2019t using the boys\u2019 bathroom, he\u2019s not using the girls\u2019 bathroom, he\u2019s hardly using a bathroom at all.\u00a0 I worry every day.\u00a0 Going to the bathroom should be the easiest part of the school day.\u00a0 But, for my son it\u2019s not.
