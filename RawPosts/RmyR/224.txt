 Hey Everybody, Instead of putting up a blog post this week, I’m here to ask you to do something for me.  Two things actually.  Pretty please…. 1.  CNN has submitted a panel for SXSW 2013 which assembles some of the coolest moms I know — Amelia (Huffington Post), Nerdy Apple (“My Son is Gay”), Kelly Byrom (CNN) and me — to discuss new media as a tool for parents of the youngest members of the LGBTQ community. We need your votes to help get the panel selected by the SXSW conference planners.  Please visit: http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/2637 and give us the thumbs up.  You may need to sign up to vote, I promise you it is a very quick process. 2.  I’ve been nominated as one of Southern California’s Top 25 Bloggers by Circle of Moms.  Will you please vote for me here, too?  No sign up needed.  Click here, select the purple “Pending Approval” tab in the middle of the page, find my blog and click on the thumbs up sign.  You can vote every 24 hours for the next four days. Thank you, thank you, thank you for your support.  I’d be out there pressing the flesh and holding babies to earn your votes, but it’s 96 degrees outside and the pool is calling. Happy Summer! C.J.’s Mom
