I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about this lesson and what an excellent tool it is for teachers, so I\u2019ve reblogged it here with Tando\u2019s permission.  I can\u2019t even explain to you how happy I would be if every teacher at C.J.\u2019s school gave this lesson to their students during the first week or two of school.   (BTW, there\u2019s a PDF at the end for easy printing, sharing and posting.) Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW I created this \u201cgender lesson\u201d for teachers to present in schools based on the needs of gender nonconforming children I see in my private practice and those I read about online. Please share with any and all classrooms/teachers! Below is the lesson, and following that will be a PDF with the lesson and a list of \u201cexpectations\u201d that can be posted in the classroom. This lesson was created in particular for those teachers who have gender nonconforming children in their classrooms. However, it is my belief that this curriculum is needed in ALL classrooms, to change society\u2019s stereotypes, reduce stigmatization of children, decrease bullying, and increase acceptance of each other. This lesson is to be presented at the very beginning of the school year to set standards of expectations for behavior, and can be reviewed as needed throughout the school year. It should be appropriate for grades K-5; please modify\u2026 View original post 846 more words   ", "feedtitle": "Page 23 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
