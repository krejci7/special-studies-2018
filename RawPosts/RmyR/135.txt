During our many adventures, she is often asked what it\u2019s like to be friends with us, how she supports our family as we raise C.J. and what non-family allies can do to help.\u00a0 Here are her thoughts.\u00a0 Marie\u2019s daughter Grace is four weeks older than C.J. They love each other. I have been friends with C.J.\u2019s Mom for about 15 years now.\u00a0 We met in college and bonded over our love of the written word and literature on a trip hosted by our fabulous English professor.\u00a0 We have been through births, miscarriages, silly times, sad times, drunk times and \u2014 of utmost importance \u2014 parenting times. Parenting isn\u2019t easy.\u00a0 Period.\u00a0 There are no manuals; we all know this.\u00a0 God sometimes throws curve balls at us.\u00a0 Well, he threw one right into C.J.\u2019s Mom and C.J.\u2019s Dad\u2019s home.\u00a0 It was a perfectly pitched curve ball too \u2013 the batter at the plate said, \u201cYep.\u00a0 I\u2019ll take a swing at it\u201d and the team manager supported the decision.\u00a0 Since then, there have been a few singles, doubles and triples; even a homerun or two.\u00a0 Every once in a while, they strike out, but in my humble opinion, it\u2019s a rare occasion. My family has been on this journey with C.J.\u2019s parents the entire time and so maybe that helps when it comes to acceptance.\u00a0 We knew C.J. B.B. (Before Barbie) and we loved him.\u00a0 And, we know C.J. A.B. (After Barbie) and we love him.\u00a0 One thing I know about the A.B. C.J. is that his personality is far more outgoing.\u00a0 He wants to be involved in things, has opinions about things and loves imaginative play.\u00a0 The B.B. C.J. was sweet, but his personality was not as bold and sociable as the A.B. C.J. When C.J.\u2019s parents embraced him for everything he loved and wanted to play with, C.J. began to sparkle.\u00a0 There\u2019s no other way to put it.\u00a0 He sparkled. All parents want (or should want) their child to sparkle and sometimes it takes a little extra time to find the one thing that triggers the glittery moment \u2013 but when they do, loving and nurturing parents will move Heaven and Earth to make it happen for their child on a consistent basis.\u00a0 I cannot imagine a world where C.J. was forced to play with a toy he didn\u2019t like all because people said the toy he did like wasn\u2019t \u201cfor boys.\u201d I will admit, it was uncomfortable at first.\u00a0 I won\u2019t lie.\u00a0 Not that I was personally uncomfortable with buying dolls or other \u201cgirl toys\u201d for C.J.; after all, our (adult) feelings don\u2019t really matter in all this.\u00a0 The person\u2019s whose feelings matter are the child\u2019s.\u00a0 But that was just it \u2013 I didn\u2019t know how to react to C.J.\u2019s feelings and at that, didn\u2019t know how to react to C.J.\u2019s parents\u2019 feelings about C.J.\u2019s feelings.\u00a0 Sound familiar??\u00a0 (If you know anything about this blog, it should!) For about a year, I called and asked, \u201cIs it ok if we buy C.J. this or that for Christmas, his birthday or just because I was picking it up for my daughter?\u201d\u00a0 The answer was a bit hesitant at first, because they were navigating new waters, but it didn\u2019t take long for the answer to become a resounding \u201cyep.\u201d\u00a0 Now, there\u2019s no reason to call. C.J. and Grace even coordinate their Halloween costumes. C.J. and Chase and my two daughters have grown up together and everything is very normal for them.\u00a0 Both my daughters have stood up for C.J. when other girls have said his liking girl\u2019s things is \u201cweird\u201d or that he should only like \u201cboy\u2019s stuff.\u201d Families with gender non-conforming children have to surround themselves with like-minded people \u2013 people who are tolerant and patient, understanding and compassionate.\u00a0 There is no room for hate or ignorance.\u00a0 I can\u2019t imagine how tough it is on people who do not have a structured support system.\u00a0 As family and friends, our job is to help with kindness, not criticize with disdain.\u00a0 This is not an area for you to offer advice unless you\u2019re asked for it.\u00a0 In my experience, C.J.\u2019s parents questioned all decisions, no matter how insignificant they may have been.\u00a0 The last thing parents need is someone giving his or her two cents, adding to the confusion. Stay positive and love the child (and family) whether you\u2019re in a public or a private setting.\u00a0 You can\u2019t say things are okay at home and then turn your back on the family when you are in public.\u00a0 You shouldn\u2019t be expected to \u201cget it\u201d out of the gates, either.\u00a0 Some people are naturally going to be more accepting than others, but the best thing you can do is love and support the family as they journey down their path. \u00a0Don\u2019t turn your back on them or dismiss their feelings as insignificant or trivial.\u00a0 The child may or may not be going through a \u201cphase\u201d and you do not want to be a part of bullying a child. The family will appreciate you being open to their new situation and trust me \u2013 no one is more nervous than the parents.\u00a0 Like C.J.\u2019s Mom has said before, they have lost several undeserving friends throughout this journey.\u00a0 Friends who wouldn\u2019t accept C.J. or the rest of the family because he didn\u2019t conform to society\u2019s \u201cnorms.\u201d\u00a0 Shame on them.\u00a0 Too bad for them.\u00a0 They, and others like them, are missing out on knowing a beautiful family who has much to offer others.\u00a0 Give the family time to figure things out.\u00a0 C.J.\u2019s Mom and Dad revise their plan daily as they follow C.J.\u2019s lead.\u00a0 Allow your family and friends to do the same.\u00a0 Follow them.\u00a0 Be there to listen.\u00a0 Above all else, a favorite saying of mine and C.J.\u2019s Mom is, \u201cJust don\u2019t be an asshole.\u201d What do you think?\u00a0 How can non-family allies support friends raising a differently-gendered child?\u00a0 Leave a comment below.
