 C.J. and Chase had two weeks off for winter break.  They were a long two weeks, as they tend to be when the kids are out of school.  Over the break, Chase — who has considered a future behind the camera and is quite impressive at making short films using the iMovie app on his iPad mini — tried to help C.J. make a movie using his dolls as the main characters.  Chase quickly grew bored and frustrated.  I don’t blame him. So, he taught C.J. how to take his own videos using the iPad.  C.J. proceeded to take 81 minutes of footage of himself playing with his dolls.  He might have taken more, but, alas, there was not enough free space on the iPad.  I found the many clips last night and have compiled a few snippets so that you can get a little taste of the real C.J.  Now, you have learned some of his favorite catchphrases that I hear every day, like:  Holy ja-moly! Oh, snap! Cray-cray!  (Everybody and everything are always cray-cray) By the way… You can’t get enough of me! I’m resistible!  (Which actually means “I’m irresistible!”) I need my place to shine! I’m shopping my butt off! I did not sign up for this! I’m on fire! I quit!  You’ve probably also noticed that C.J. likes to make up his own jokes and may be overly concerned about hair and shoes.  But, I mean, can you blame him?
