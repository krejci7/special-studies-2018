 If you read my blog post from March 14 (Happy Meal with a Side of Gender Issues To Go Please), you know that when raising a fabulously effeminate son even ordering a Happy Meal can be a production.  That’s because McDonald’s typically doesn’t give out gender-neutral toys anymore, instead you must choose a “boy toy” or a “girl toy.” The solution is simple, have cashiers leave gender out of the order-taking process and ask customers if they would like, for example, the Barbie or the Hot Wheels car. Check out this photo that Raising My Rainbow Reader Greg sent to me today.  It was taken at a McDonald’s in West Hollywood.  You’d think in WeHo of all places they’d be a little more aware and considerate of those who are gender nonconforming.  If you can’t be free to show your true colors in Boys’ Town, where do you go?
