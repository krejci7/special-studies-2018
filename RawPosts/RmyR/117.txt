 This Thursday at 7 p.m., I’ll be speaking at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, about parenting, teaching and promoting advocacy for differently gendered children.  The event is sponsored by The Center School and it’s FREE!  Monte Belmonte from 93.9 & 101.5 The River had me on his show this morning.  You can listen to the interview here.   It was such a fun experience to be interviewed by a fellow parent of a gender creative child!
