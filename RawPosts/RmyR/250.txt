C.J. has been in gymnastics for about a year and had been wanting to add the ballet/tap class to his schedule for months and months. \u00a0But, since swim lessons would save his life, they took priority in the summer.\u00a0 Soccer season dominated the fall, although C.J. did not dominate soccer.\u00a0\u00a0 All the stars aligned when C.J. had a break in his schedule and two special Fairy Gay Fathers (whose initials are, oddly enough, C and J) asked if there was something they could do for C.J. and our family. \u00a0Why, yes, there was something they could do; they could pay for a few months of C.J.\u2019s dance class so we could try it out and see if he liked it as much as he thought he would.\u00a0 We headed to Payless Shoes to buy some tap shoes.\u00a0 C.J. could not control himself.\u00a0 When he saw those shiny, patent leather shoes that made loud noise, with huge black bows on top he was nearly embarrassed by his own excitement.\u00a0 He held them and rubbed them for a long while before he even thought of putting them on his feet. \u201cThose are girls\u2019 tap shoes, the boys tap shoes look like this,\u201d the Payless\u00a0Shoe salesgirl with crunchy mousse hair said bending over, exposing her crack and showing us what boy tap shoes look like.\u00a0 The boys\u2019 shoes were not shiny.\u00a0 They were dull black with boring lace ups, no Mary Jane-like cutouts on top.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI want the girl ones,\u201d C.J. said to me quickly with a look of concern. \u201cI know you do,\u201d I said ignoring Payless girl\u2019s reaction.\u00a0 When it comes to shoes we know what we like.\u00a0 We had this handled, thank you very much.\u00a0 On Saturday, I awoke to a noise I was not familiar with.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t the house alarm.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t a video game.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t an alarm clock.\u00a0 Not my phone.\u00a0 I threw on my robe and stumbled down the stairs, trying to pry my dry eyes open and brushing my bed head out of my face.\u00a0 The noise got louder.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t even 7 a.m. \u201cMommy!\u00a0 Good morning!\u00a0 Guess what today is?!\u00a0 My dance class starts today!\u201d C.J. said as he danced he tapped his shoes on our kitchen tile, giving Gregory Hines a run for his money.\u00a0 I made coffee and wondered how I was going to make two hours fly by.\u00a0 Finally, it was time to get dressed.\u00a0 I had been dreading this.\u00a0  \u201cWhere\u2019s my dance outfit?\u201d C.J. asked, as if I had been working on a sequined, lycra, organdy number in my free time.\u00a0 \u201cYou can just wear workout shorts and a t-shirt,\u201d I said. \u201cNo I can\u2019t!\u00a0 I need a tutu!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of course he did. The final ensemble was: the tights from his Frankie Stein Halloween costume that are green with fake scars and stitches on them, blue Nike athletic shorts, a purple tutu from his dress up drawer, his purple Handsome In Pink t-shirt and black socks with skeletons on them.\u00a0 He looked in the mirror and thought he looked perfect, like the dancer that lived in his soul.\u00a0 Walking through the parking lot, through the gym and up to the second-floor dance studio, it was obvious that not everyone thought C.J. looked as perfect as he thought.\u00a0  We met his teacher.  I introduced her to C.J. and let her know that we needed to borrow ballet shoes.\u00a0 She showed us to the lost and found. \u201cI get to wear those?!\u201d C.J. said smiling.\u00a0 \u201cYup.\u201d \u201cALL OF THEM?!\u201d he squealed looking at the tub of about 100 pink lost and found ballet shoes.\u00a0 \u201cNo, silly, just two, you only have two feet.\u201d \u201cAhhhh, maaaaaaaaannnnnnnn.\u201d\u00a0 If only he were a centipede.\u00a0 I returned C.J. to Miss. Milk-N-Honey\u2019s class and walked him just inside the door.\u00a0 A little girl pointed. \u201cA boy in ballet shoes!\u201d she laughed and pointed for the other girls to see.\u00a0 The little ballerinas giggled.\u00a0 C.J. self-consciously found a place on the mat and got ready to stretch.\u00a0 I explained to Miss. Milk-N-Honey that C.J. is gender nonconforming and she smiled like she knew what it meant.\u00a0 I think the tutu pretty much tipped her off to the fact that C.J. isn\u2019t your average boy. C.J.\u2019s therapist wants us to work on owning his gender nonconformity and to not be hesitant when there is the need to tell someone new.\u00a0 She doesn\u2019t think we need to go around telling everybody or flaunting it, but when it feels like an appropriate thing to do, we should do it without pause, like we are just stating the facts, there is room for a discussion if the person wants to be educated, but there isn\u2019t room for negative judgment.\u00a0 I think we are getting good at it.\u00a0 It is what it is.\u00a0 I\u2019m not labeling him for life; I\u2019m giving a name to what he is right now.\u00a0 I walked to the area where the parents sit and watch their tiny dancers.\u00a0 I looked at the sets of eyes staring at me as I found a seat.\u00a0 They were watching the new mom who just brought her son to an all-girls dance class, which has never seen a boy before.\u00a0 And, he was wearing a tutu and pink ballet shoes.
