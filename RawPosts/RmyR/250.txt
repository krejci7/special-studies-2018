I hate being the new mom.\u00a0 I sat down on the benches outside of the dance studio by myself, looking through the one-way mirror at my son transform into a dancer.\u00a0 A mother and daughter came running up the benches and dropped their bags next me.\u00a0 They were late.\u00a0 The mother started to hastily change her daughter out of her light-up sneakers and into her ballet\u00a0shoes.\u00a0 As the little girl held onto the bench for balance she caught site of C.J. \u201cLook at the new girl!\u00a0 Why is her hair so short!?\u201d she asked loudly. The mother looked up. \u201cI don\u2019t know, honey, some girls just like to have their hair really short like a boy,\u201d she replied.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s my son,\u201d I said quietly to the mother.\u00a0 Her face turned 15 shades of red as she confirmed to her daughter that she had been right; the new girl in dance class was a boy.\u00a0 The mother hurried her daughter in the studio and did not return to her seat next to me.\u00a0 It\u2019s okay, we are used to being the elephant in the room. My eyes were glued to C.J.\u00a0 I had never seen him happier, more focused.\u00a0 Finally, he was a dancer.\u00a0 My heart was melting, yet again, for my sweet gender creative boy. After the break, during which the kids metamorphosed from ballet dancers to tap dancers with a simple change of shoes, one of the other mothers had no choice but to sit next to me.\u00a0 I decided to get friendly. \u201cHow old is your daughter?\u201d I asked, startling her. \u201cShe\u2019s five.\u00a0 How old is your\u2026..little\u2026.guy,\u201d she asked nervously gripping her Starbucks for safety.\u00a0 Is a boy in a tutu and ballet shoes in an all-girls dance class still a boy? \u201cHe\u2019s going to be five next month,\u201d I said with a smile.\u00a0 Apparently there was nothing else to talk about.\u00a0 A mom behind me tapped my shoulder.\u00a0 \u201cI think it\u2019s so great that your son\u2019s taking dance.\u00a0 My little girl in there has a twin brother and I never even thought to ask him if he wanted to try it,\u201d she said. \u201cThanks,\u201d I smiled sincerely. An advanced adult ballet class started in the studio next door.\u00a0 I was watching the graceful grown ballerinas and thinking about Black Swan and Natalie Portman\u00a0and her baby and if she would be at the Golden Globes after retreating from Hollywood with her dreamy ballerina man.\u00a0 A man entered that class late.\u00a0 He set his bags down and stripped down to skin-tight black leggings and a tight, deep v-neck.\u00a0 He found a place on the bar.\u00a0 Oh my.\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 I get it.\u00a0 Dancers are good looking.\u00a0 I watched him move, he was better than every woman in the room. Before dismissal, each tiny dancer was given a coloring sheet as a reward for their hard work.\u00a0 It was a ballerina Hello Kitty.\u00a0 Miss. Milk-N-Honey asked if that was okay for C.J.\u00a0 I assured her that it was right up his alley. C.J. and I took a few minutes to watch the adults dance next door.\u00a0 C.J. was enraptured.\u00a0 \u201cDo you see the boy dancing?\u201d I asked, leaning down to his level and pointing as he spotted him. \u201cWwwoooooooowwwwwwwww,\u201d he said slowly.\u00a0 Oh yeah.\u00a0 He saw him.\u00a0 \u201cMommy, he\u2019s better than the girls.\u00a0 I want to be like that.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYou can,\u201d I said. In the car on the way home, I asked C.J. if he liked dance class. \u201cI. \u00a0Tote-a-wee.\u00a0 Wuved it.\u201d The next class couldn\u2019t come soon enough.\u00a0 C.J.\u2019s raced me to Miss. Milk-N-Honey.\u00a0 He was a man, in tights, on a mission.\u00a0 Like a super hero, but different.\u00a0 \u201cMiss. Milk-N-Honey.\u00a0 Today I\u2019m gonna wear my skirt again to class.\u00a0 Can you pwease tell the girls not to make fun of me?\u201d he said in speech so clear and premeditated that I couldn\u2019t believe it came out of his mouth. \u201cOh, sweetie, sure,\u201d Miss. Milk-N-Honey said, looking loving and concerned. I couldn\u2019t say anything; there was a lump in my throat.\u00a0 C.J.\u2019s Dad walked up the stairs then. \u201cOhhhh, I feel like I\u2019m on Dance Moms,\u201d he said as he entered the studio, saw the parents\u2019 seating area, grabbed as seat next to me and put his arm around me.\u00a0 My macho husband makes me smile regularly. \u201cShe\u2019s no Abby Lee Miller,\u201d he said upon glimpsing Miss. Milk-N-Honey. \u201cAlright, settle down,\u201d I said without looking at him, all eyes on C.J. Class started and C.J. was crab walking across the wood floor. \u201cWe need to work on getting his butt up during the crab walk,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad said softly.\u00a0 If C.J. were playing t-ball, he\u2019d be taking similar mental notes, thinking of ways to help C.J. improve.\u00a0 I love this man for being passionate and interested in the things that speak to C.J.\u2019s soul: \u201cgender traditional\u201d or not.\u00a0 I don\u2019t tell him enough that it takes a big man to lovingly-father a girly boy.\u00a0 He\u2019s proof that a bully can be reformed. \u201cAre boy ballerinas called \u2018ballerinos\u2019,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad interrupted my thought. C.J.\u2019s Dad and I took turns watching C.J.\u2019s Brother practice parkour in the main gym downstairs.\u00a0 We were afraid to leave C.J. upstairs alone by himself and afraid of what the other parents might gossip about when we weren\u2019t around.\u00a0 We know we shouldn\u2019t care, but we do.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on it. Class was ending and it was time for coloring sheets.\u00a0\u00a0 Miss. Milk-N-Honey brought out two options to choose from: SpongeBob\u00a0SquarePants and Princess Jasmine.\u00a0 Options.\u00a0 Options are good.\u00a0 C.J. went straight for Princes Jasmine.\u00a0 Miss. Milk-N-Honey smiled at me and acknowledged that with a boy in the class she felt like she should have a boy coloring sheet to choose and, even better, that she never considered that one of the girls might want a \u201cboy\u201d coloring sheet. Three cheers for Miss. Milk-N-Honey!\u00a0 She turned and walked away and I read the back of her shirt. \u201cWherever you go, go with all your heart.\u201d I grabbed C.J.\u2019s little hand and his tutu and his tap shoes and we went, with all our heart.
