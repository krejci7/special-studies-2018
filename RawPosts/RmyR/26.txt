(age 10). If you aren\u2019t caught up on Drag Race, it contains spoilers. All photo creds go to LogoTV.com.  This season\u2019s first episode wasn\u2019t as good as the first episode from other seasons. It took me a little while to get super in to this season. But, now I am. Bam. Jaymes Mansfield On the first episode I liked Jaymes Mansfield and Nina Bo\u2019Nina Brown the best. Jaymes Mansfield because she came out with a puppet and Nina Bo\u2019Nina Brown because her look was inspired by Mickey Mouse. But my favorite queen from the first episode was Lady Gaga. She wasn\u2019t really a competitor, but she was still my favorite. I liked it when Lady Gaga said that drag offers an escape. I think drag is a great escape. Sometimes I use drag to escape boring real life. In this episode Valentina and Sasha Velour were my mom\u2019s favorites. Sometimes we don\u2019t have the same favorites and that\u2019s okay. RuPaul said no one was going home during the episode and I was like \u201cNo one is going home? Then what\u2019s the point of it?!\u201d The best quote of the episode was when someone said \u201cthe entire point of drag is to give the middle finger to rules of gender.\u201d I said that the next day to my mom before school. She laughed and said it was true but I shouldn\u2019t talk about giving the middle finger. Especially at school. Nina Bo\u2019Nina Brown I\u2019m glad Nina Bo\u2019Nina won the first episode. I think Mama Ru made the right choice. Then, at the end of the first episode they said some queen was coming back and showed the back of the queen\u2019s head and I yelled \u201cOMG! It\u2019s Coco Montrese with her Dorito face!\u201d Every episode I look for a wedding ring on RuPaul\u2019s finger because my mom told me he got married! But I haven\u2019t seen a wedding ring yet. Where is Ru\u2019s husband?! RuPaul\u2019s probably not wearing a ring for the show but he is probably definitely wearing it when he\u2019s not on the show. I was not happy that Cynthia Lee Fontaine came back to the show on the second episode. I thought it wasn\u2019t fair that she was back at first, but now I\u2019m glad she\u2019s back because she had to leave the first time because she had cancer and she deserves a second chance. Everybody deserves a second chance, especially if you had cancer. There is a wax statue of RuPaul in the workroom and I want it more than anything. I would put it in my room. I also want a wall of fabric in my room, like they have in the workroom. But, my mom says we just redid my room recently and we aren\u2019t going to do it again anytime soon, but I feel like that was such a long time ago. Kimora Blac In the second episode I realized how whiny Kimora Blac is. I thought Peppermint was the best on the runway and she became one of my new overall favorites for a minute. Jaymes Mansfield had to sashay away and that was the right decision even though at the very first she was my favorite. Her personality wasn\u2019t ready for Drag Race. She maybe should have waited a season or two. By the third episode (which is the most recent one you should watch), Valentina is my new official favorite. She is soooooooo good at eye makeup. In the episode Kimora said she didn\u2019t know what an adjective is. By Kimora\u2019s age you should know what an adjective is. By that age I\u2019m going to know them in my sleep. Sasha Velour said \u201cwe need to be proudly visible queer.\u201d I told my mom I liked the sound of that quote and she asked me why but I couldn\u2019t explain it. I can\u2019t always explain how quotes make me feel. On the runway Cynthia Lee Fontaine\u2019s outfit looked a little like a kindergarten craft, no offense.\u00a0I liked Farrah Moan\u2019s seashell bra and lots of the queens had really great hair. Kimora was a no in my opinion. Nina Bo\u2019Nina always does great at gluing a mask to her face. But I have to admit her look scared me a little.\u00a0I\u2019m just a kid! Valentina Valentina\u2019s look was my favorite. She reminded me of a grown up drag Shirley Temple. Her eye makeup is always so good.\u00a0So good. RuPaul made another good choice sending Kimora Blac home. When she gets home she should learn how to sew and not pay people to do it. And learn what adjectives are. I can\u2019t wait to watch the rest of the season and see who wins. Right now I want Valentina or Nino Bo\u2019Nina to win. Who do you want to win? \u00a0 \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
