He has employed this tactic while I\u2019ve been driving, cooking dinner and running on the treadmill in our garage. The other night, as I sat on my bathroom floor painting my toenails, Chase walked in and asked if he could soak in the bath, I did see him browsing the internet about\u00a0united kingdom shower baths trends but\u00a0 I should have known something was up; he always takes a shower. He ran the water, added some bubbles, stepped in, sat down and closed the shower curtain. He said something that I couldn\u2019t hear over the running bath water. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you. Wait until you turn the water off,\u201d I shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad that some parents don\u2019t accept their kid if they are gay,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that really true?\u201d \u201cYeah, it\u2019s true and it is really, really sad\u2026.\u201d I said before he interrupted me. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it. I just read an article about it online,\u201d he said in a voice full of worry. Chase on Halloween. We\u2019ve been open with both of our sons that not everyone is supportive of the LGBTQ community \u2013 even some parents of community members. But, Chase didn\u2019t believe me until he read it online. \u201cBut, you know that we will love you and support you no matter what, right?\u201d I had stopped painting my nails and was now talking to the shower curtain. \u201cI know that. You and dad would love me the same no matter if I\u2019m gay or straight.\u201d He sounded assured. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you love a boy or a girl, I just want you to be with someone who is good and kind and treats you well and who you want to treat well. I want you to have a good partner.\u201d \u201cIf I date a transgender person, does that make me bisexual?\u201d he asked. I didn\u2019t see that question coming. I looked bewilderingly at the shower curtain. \u201cUmmmmm\u2026.\u201d I had to think, but was having a hard time concentrating as the conversation had quickly taken a turn down a path I had not anticipated. \u201cIs the transgender person you are potentially dating a boy or a girl? \u201cGirl.\u201d \u201cOkay, so she was born with a boy body but identifies as a girl and lives as a girl and dresses as a girl?\u201d I clarified. \u201cYes, I think so.\u201d \u201cIs this a real life girl you\u2019re thinking about?\u201d I asked. \u201cNO!\u201d He still isn\u2019t totally comfortable admitting to me when he finds someone attractive. Chase bowling. \u201cOkay, sorry, just checking. Ummm, I guess that\u2019s a little bit tricky.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to ask if the fictional transgender female had transitioned medically because I was already getting bogged down by logistics. \u201cTo me, that would make you straight and would make her straight. But, I guess to some people that would make you bisexual\u2026.\u201d \u201cOkay, then that would be the only time I\u2019m bisexual, the rest of the time I\u2019d be straight,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cSounds good,\u201d I said, not knowing what to say and rolling my eyes at myself for only the shower curtain to see. \u201cI guess that could also make you pansexual,\u201d I offered \u2014 because I couldn\u2019t leave well enough alone. \u201cWhat does pansexual mean?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt means that you fall in love with the person, not their sex or gender.\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019ll be pansexual because that starts with \u2018pan\u2019 and \u2018pancake\u2019 starts with \u2018pan\u2019 and pancakes are my favorite food,\u201d he reasoned. I\u2019d never heard someone identify sexually based on a sexual orientation sounding like their favorite breakfast food, but who was I to judge. \u201cPancakes are good,\u201d I agreed. I heard him pull the drain and the water start to empty from the tub. He pulled the shower curtain back. \u201cI think it\u2019s really cool that you\u2019re open to dating a trans person. You have a good heart,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said hurriedly as he wrapped himself in a towel and scurried out of the room quickly, avoiding the dreaded eye contact that accompanies conversations about love and sex between mother and tween son.
