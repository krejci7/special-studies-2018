Now, Samuel is a girl named Sophia. Initially, C.J. and Samuel bonded over being boys who liked to be mermaids in water and princesses on land. They painted their nails together, celebrated birthdays together and put on fashion shows together. \u201cSamuel is more gender nonconforming than I am,\u201d C.J. would point out to me privately. It was a fact that often caught him by surprise because he rarely met a boy who was more gender nonconforming than he was. About this time last year, Samuel decided \u2014 once and for all \u2014 that he was not Samuel, he was Sophia. I had emotional talks with Samuel\u2019s mom. We\u2019d both always known it was a possibility that our sons were transgender; but, thinking it could be so and having it be so are vastly different. Nothing prepares you for your boy\u2019s first day of school as a girl. With every ounce of my being, I tried to make it all about Sophia and her mom during our talks and time together during her transition. Then, I\u2019d hang up or walk away and wonder what Sophia\u2019s transition would mean for my son and my family. C.J. had gone through periods during which he wanted to be known as Rebecca, Chloe, Raquel and Cleo. At different times, he said that he\u2019d be a girl when he grew up. A few times, he\u2019s said that he might be trans. But, he never fully committed to any of it. When it came to his gender identity and gender expression, we followed his lead, but he never continually led us in the same direction. It was maddening a lot of the time, though we never let him know it. If his friend Samuel became Sophia, what would C.J. become? Would C.J. want to transition because Sophia did? If C.J. transitioned, would it be the right decision for him? After much stalling, I nervously sat down next to C.J. on his bed and explained to him that Samuel was becoming Sophia. He looked at me oddly and thought for a minute or two. \u201cIs he transgender?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes. She is transgender. So from now on we call her Sophia and use \u2018her\u2019 and \u2018she\u2019 instead of \u2018he\u2019 and \u2018him,\u2019\u201d I replied. He was quiet some more. \u201cWhat are you feeling?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cAre you sad?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cAre you jealous?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cI want to wear dresses to school and everywhere like Sophia will now.\u201d \u201cWell, you know you can.\u201d \u201cI know. But it\u2019s different now because she\u2019ll be a girl wearing a dress and I\u2019ll still be a boy wearing a dress.\u201d The first few times C.J. saw Sophia, I saw some envy in his green eyes as he studied her. I worried how Sophia\u2019s transition made C.J. feel; it was clear that it was making him feel something. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a girl every day. I don\u2019t even want to be a girl every other day. I\u2019m not transgender,\u201d he blurted out one day while we were playing with his LEGO Friends. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said. C.J. has been consistently leading us in the same direction for six months now. I was worried that Sophia\u2019s transition would influence C.J. to do the same, but, as of right now, it\u2019s done the opposite. C.J. still dresses up in skirts and dresses at home, plays with dolls, paints his nails and loves to take part in fashion shows. He\u2019s the same boy he was when he met Samuel, even though Samuel is not. \u201cI\u2019m gender nonconforming, but I\u2019m not transgender,\u201d he sometimes explains to people. I tell him he doesn\u2019t need to clarify. \u201cSometimes I do,\u201d he insists. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say. C.J. and Sophia have taught me that gender is unique to every person. You don\u2019t have to clarify your gender for other people, but sometimes you have to clarify your gender for yourself.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
