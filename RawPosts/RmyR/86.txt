The line of questioning irritated me because Matt is an amazing father. The next day, Matt sent to me this beautiful letter for safe keeping for C.J. (Chase got his own letter.) Dear C.J., Your mom loves this quote and has had it above her desk for years. I\u2019ve seen it there and read it so many times that now it\u2019s one of my favorites, too. It makes me think of you. \u201cOur deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, \u2018Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?\u2019 Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. \u00a0Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won\u2019t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do.\u201d\u2014 Marianne Williamson I have said in many interviews over the past two years that the most important job I have as a father is to raise you and your brother to be respectful, responsible, courageous people.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care if you love males, females or people who identify as neither or all of the above. I don\u2019t care what toys you play with or what colors you like.\u00a0 I care that you respect yourself and others. That you are responsible for your own things and actions and the effects they potentially have on other people. I want you to act courageously, not cowardly. You don\u2019t have to be a hero, but don\u2019t make other people your victims or allow people to make you theirs. Always remember, being compassionate and understanding is just as important as being strong and decisive. You make me proud and I love watching you grow as the years keep flying by.\u00a0 I\u2019m inspired everyday by your creativeness, bravery and confidence. A lot of times, when I hear LGBTQ people talk about growing up, they say that their parents were mean to them.\u00a0 I want you to always remember that I never, ever, do anything just to be mean to you or because I don\u2019t love you or because I don\u2019t approve of you.\u00a0 I like you.\u00a0 I love you. I approve of you. \u00a0I think you\u2019re perfect. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find my parenting frustrating at times.\u00a0 You may think my rules are too strict and unwavering.\u00a0 I\u2019m okay with that, because I\u2019m a parent. \u00a0I\u2019m trying to help you become the best person you can be.\u00a0 I will push you and teach you and love you and support you. That\u2019s my job.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure at times you will say that I\u2019m too hard on you or that I hold you to higher standards than other people.\u00a0 I\u2019m alright with that too, because I do.\u00a0 As a parent, it is harder to be tough and consistent than lenient and convenient. I\u2019m constantly working my hardest to help you be your best. As you grow up, you will disappoint your mother and me by making poor choices.\u00a0 That\u2019s alright too.\u00a0 That\u2019s why it\u2019s called growing up.\u00a0 I just want you to grow from the times when you stumble.\u00a0 I\u2019ll always be right behind you to pick you up and point you in the right direction again.\u00a0 That\u2019s my job.\u00a0 Your job is to learn from your mistakes.\u00a0 You have to get back on the right path and let me hold your hand as you walk a little farther along. When you are an adult and leave our home, you will never leave my heart or my family.\u00a0 By that time, I hope I will have prepared you to be an exceptional person with inspirational qualities.\u00a0 I am so proud of the person you are becoming and the character you are already demonstrating.\u00a0 Always be true to who you are.\u00a0 Never doubt who you are. \u00a0Never. Life will be tough and unfair.\u00a0 People will be jerks.\u00a0 You may be judged and people may be condescending toward you.\u00a0 Don\u2019t let anyone make you play small.\u00a0 Don\u2019t ever let anyone prevent you from being your most honest, whole self.\u00a0 Don\u2019t shrink to make others feel more comfortable.\u00a0 Your true personality and character are what make you the person I love. Your journey will be difficult and frustrating like many other young adults.\u00a0 Always remember that when things get hard I will be right behind you pushing you to learn and be resilient. I will always love you and support you and I will always have your back, ALWAYS. Love, Your Dad   ", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
