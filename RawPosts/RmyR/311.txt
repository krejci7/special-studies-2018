 I love to get e-mails sharing stories like this…. My youngest son said that this was for girls. I used to say “uh-huh.”  But, you have inspired me to tell him that, “it’s not JUST for girls…If you wanted this, I’d get it for you.”  My son then said, “Well, it’s not for me.” — T Raising My Rainbow has inspired some little change in one family?  Well then, it has served its purpose.  Let’s make this world a better place for our kids, no matter their orientation.
