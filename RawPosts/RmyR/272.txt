We arrived bright and early: C.J., C.J.\u2019s Brother, Uncle Uncle\u2019s boyfriend and me.\u00a0 We signed in and I asked the sweet little innocent camp counselor what was on the agenda for the day. \u201cOkay.\u00a0 Well.\u00a0 We have free play from 9 to 9:15 a.m., stretching from 9:15 to 9:30 a.m., then we put the kids in groups based on their age and gender,\u201d she seemed so happy to be able to answer my questions so thoroughly. Uncle Uncle\u2019s boyfriend looked at me and I was glad that he got the chance to see what I to deal with on a constant basis.\u00a0 \u201cWhat do the different gender groups do?\u201d I asked. \u201cWell, the girls do gymnastics, cheerleading and dance and the boys do soccer, rock climbing and go on the big trampolines,\u201d again she was so proud to be capable at her job.\u00a0 \u201cMy son might want to go with the girls,\u201d I said. She hadn\u2019t been instructed what to do in this situation.\u00a0 Deer in headlights.\u00a0 I scooped up C.J. \u201cC.J., do you want to do gymnastics, cheerleading and dance or soccer, rock climbing and trampolines?,\u201d I asked. \u201cTrampolines!,\u201d C.J. replied excitedly, already bouncing. \u201cIt looks like he\u2019ll go with that group, then,\u201d I told the camp counselor, refusing to call it the boy group. \u201cAlrighty,\u201d she said looking relieved.\u00a0 You and me both, sister. My son wanted to go in the boy group.\u00a0 (Actually he really just wanted to bounce on the trampolines, but I\u2019ll take it.)\u00a0 I walked out of the gym feeling a little different.\u00a0 My son chose to go with the boys and do \u201cboy\u201d things.\u00a0 I\u2019d have to get used to the idea.\u00a0 \u201cWhy do they have to break them up by gender?\u00a0 I bet there are five girls in there who want to climb that rock wall.\u00a0 Hell, I wanted to climb the rock wall,\u201d Uncle Uncle\u2019s boyfriend said as we walked to the car.\u00a0 \u201cAs a child, I would have much rather climbed the rock wall and bounced on the trampoline than do a cheer and dance routine,\u201d I said, wishing that they would break the kids into groups not by gender, but by activity preference.\u00a0 But what did I care that day\u2026my boy wanted to be in the boy group. And, the next day he wanted to be\u00a0a cheerleader.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 28 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
