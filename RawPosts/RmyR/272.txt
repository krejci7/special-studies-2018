We\u2019re your worst nightmare; a brigade of gays and an effeminate boy who doesn\u2019t fall neatly and \u201ctraditionally\u201d on the gender spectrum.\u00a0 Run, girl, run!\u00a0 Back to your house!\u00a0 Shut your door!\u00a0 Pray! People like you cast looks of judgment that are fierce (and not in a good way).\u00a0 You break people\u2019s spirits in the name of the Lord, when really that is not at all what God was/is about.\u00a0 God was/is about love and kindness, not fear and hatred.\u00a0 Maybe he\u2019s using this as a lesson for you, a way to soften your heart to your fellow human.\u00a0 A way of telling you that real judgment is his, not yours, to own.\u00a0 Maybe he\u2019s telling you to move (but, not to Orange County, thanks). You becoming agoraphobic isn\u2019t doing anything positive for your kids.\u00a0 It\u2019s making the world small and scary to them.\u00a0 You may not be ready to have a talk with your kids about gender and sexuality, but it would be age-appropriate to show them, with words and actions, what it means to love others as you love yourself.\u00a0  Words like yours aren\u2019t helping the way society views your religion.\u00a0 Spewing hatred, and using your religion to justify it, does not make you a good catholic or a good person. Honey, you aren\u2019t holier than any of us.\u00a0 You\u2019re a sinner just like us; we\u2019re all the same that way.\u00a0 If one of your seven children ever comes out, send him/her to my house for a love you can\u2019t give them.\u00a0 They\u2019ll have so much fun! We\u2019ll even leave the house! Bless You, C.J.\u2019s Mom * * * I\u2019m super proud to be named one of Ignite Social Media\u2019s \u201c100 Women Bloggers You Should Be Reading.\u201d\u00a0 I can\u2019t wait to check out all of the other bloggers on the list.
