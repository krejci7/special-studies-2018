His Christmas wish list has been done for weeks.\u00a0 He keeps it in various \u201csafe places\u201d \u2013 like under his pillow, in his dirty clothes hamper, rolled up and jammed in the shower of his Barbie Dream House and folded up in his jewelry box.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t let me send the hard copy to Santa lest he forget the items on the list; so he instructed me to \u201cemail text it to Santa on Instagram.\u201d\u00a0 Rest assured that I did just that and hashtagged it #americangirldollsareexpensive, #ithoughtwewereluckyenoughtoskiptheamericangirldollphase and #pleasehaveyourelvesmaketheamericangirldollsothatidonthavetobuyit.  Yes, at the top of C.J.\u2019s wish list is the American Girl doll named Julie Albright.\u00a0 She\u2019s a San Franciscan from 1974 with long, silky blonde hair.\u00a0 Second and third on C.J.\u2019s list, are gymnastic equipment and a bed for Julie. You\u2019ll see on the list that C.J. has also been coveting the Barbie FAO Schwarz Toy Soldier Doll offered exclusively by Toys R Us \u2013 which says that the doll is \u201cthe perfect gift for any girl!\u201d\u00a0 I think she\u2019s fabulous and would love to wear her complete look from head to toe.\u00a0 She may already be wrapped and under our tree, allegedly. C.J. wants every Monster High doll.\u00a0 I asked him why he didn\u2019t put them on his list and he said because Santa and everybody in the world already know that he wants them. He put a Barbie Dream House on his list even though he already has one.\u00a0 When I asked him about it, he explained that he wants to make New York City in his bedroom and have lots of buildings, skyscrapers and apartments for \u201chis girls\u201d (his girls = every 11 inch doll that he owns). At the bottom of the list, you\u2019ll notice he wants a WWE wrestling ring set.\u00a0 That one really surprised me.\u00a0 When asked about it, I learned that C.J. likes the figurine that it comes with (you should zoom in to take a closer look) and he thinks that ring will go well with his Monster High dolls. Researching and writing the wish list was a labor intensive task for C.J.\u2019s personal life. \u00a0For his academic life, he spent quality time decorating a giant construction paper gingerbread person.\u00a0 Here it is:  It is half girl and half boy.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been told that the boy parts are the pants, sunglasses and lips.\u00a0 The girl parts are the peplum (I hate peplums and C.J. loves them.\u00a0 When it comes to this matter, we\u2019ve learned to agree to disagree), the hair and the jeweled barrette.\u00a0 The shirt is covered in candy and candy is for everybody and, so, the shirt is for boys and girls. This Friday is the last day of school before C.J.\u2019s two-week winter break.\u00a0 There\u2019s going to be a party and book exchange.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the fine print:  \u2026because books aren\u2019t for everybody, there are \u201cbooks for boys\u201d and \u201cbooks for girls.\u201d\u00a0 When I read the note to C.J. he said, \u201cso, I\u2019m going to get a book that I don\u2019t want? \u00a0A boys book?\u201d \u00a0For his contribution to the book exchange, he selected Yakov and the Seven Thieves because he thinks that it looks like boys will like it and, more importantly, because it was written by Madonna.\u00a0 He had me sign the gift tag \u201cTo a boy or a girl, Love C.J.\u201d   ", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
