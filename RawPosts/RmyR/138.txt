If you don\u2019t celebrate Christmas, I hope that you are having a super awesome day.\u00a0 xoxo, Lori (and the entire family) \u201cFor more than half of his life, my son has preferred dolls, toys and clothes that are marketed to girls. It started when he was two and a half and he picked up a Barbie and refused to put her down. He\u2019s gone through all of the toy phases that girls his age usually go through.\u00a0 Barbie gave way to Disney Princesses gave way to My Little Pony gave way to Monster High. My son is now almost 7 years old and I thought that our pocketbooks were going to luck out and that he was going to skip over the very pricey American Girl doll phase. I really thought we were in the clear.
