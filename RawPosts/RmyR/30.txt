I wanted to slowly educate people in a non-threatening way.\u201d That\u2019s my standard answer. I\u2019ve been thinking for a while now that I\u2019m not blogging as much, so I\u2019m not educating people as much as I could and should be. That bums me out. So, I very quietly started a public Instagram account (@RaisingMyRainbow) to see if it felt like a good (read: easy) way to share a little more of our journey. Then I read this in an email from Gender Spectrum regarding the Trump administration\u2019s recension of important support for transgender students. \u201cIf you want to take action regarding the administration\u2019s decision, make a commitment today to do what you can to increase understandings of gender in your world. Your story may be just what someone needs to hear. Your story can make a difference.\u201d I\u2019m following Gender Spectrum\u2019s orders and asking all of you to follow me on Instagram, share my posts and tag people when the mood strikes. I envision still writing a few blog posts a month. Sharing news and things I find important on Facebook and Twitter. And, chronicling our daily lives and thoughts on Instagram. Let\u2019s see how that plan works. I\u2019m open to comments, thoughts, suggestions, etc. Do you want me to share the same exact thing across all three social media platforms? Do you want me to compile Instagram posts and share them on my blog, Facebook and Twitter routinely? I just don\u2019t want you to get sick of me. Leave a comment below or shoot me an email (raisingmyrainbow@gmail.com) with your thoughts. xoxo, Lori   ", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
