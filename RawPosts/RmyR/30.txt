Entertainment) Emma Stone: LOVE. The end of it is the best part because it is fringe-y. I really liked La La Land. The music was the best. If I talked to the person who made that mistake at the end of the Oscars, I would say \u201cGet it right, girlfriend.\u201d Emma Stone looked the best out of everyone. Raphaela Neihausen: That is a toddler\u2019s dress. Karlie Kloss: I like the cape. Capes always look cool. I would enjoy using my markers and coloring on that dress. Jessica Biel: No, no, no, no, no. That didn\u2019t look right to me. That dress reminds me of a video game that won\u2019t load all the way. That necklace is too much for that dress. Octavia Spencer: The bottom of her dress is like feathers waving at me and I say \u201cHey, gurl, hey\u201d to those feathers. Brie Larson: I like it because the bottom looks like a mysterious top hat. Dakota Johnson: Ugh. I don\u2019t event want to talk about that one. Janelle Monae: That top. Everyone can see her nipples. Then there is the bottom. The bottom is like two dresses at the same time and she only needed one. Halle Berry: The top is like Halloween and the bottom is like the water in Hawaii. She needs to get her hair under control. But sometimes I need to get my hair under control, so you can\u2019t blame her that it\u2019s like that. Trust me. Ryan Gosling: He\u2019s my favorite boy. I like the ruffles on his shirt a lot. Most boys don\u2019t have that. The boys have the easy way in life. They just pick a tuxedo and go to the party. Ginnifer Goodwin: No dress should ever have a turtleneck. Alicia Vikander: Her hair and makeup look like maybe she didn\u2019t know she was going to the Oscars. But the rest of her knew. Obvi. Blanca Blanco: It looks like she is wearing a duct tape dress. Someone help her now.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
