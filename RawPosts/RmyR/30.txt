 “Why did you start your blog?” That’s the blog-related question I’m asked most often. “Because I wanted to give people a glimpse into our lives raising a differently gendered child to show that we aren’t weird, we’re just different. I wanted to slowly educate people in a non-threatening way.” That’s my standard answer. I’ve been thinking for a while now that I’m not blogging as much, so I’m not educating people as much as I could and should be. That bums me out. So, I very quietly started a public Instagram account (@RaisingMyRainbow) to see if it felt like a good (read: easy) way to share a little more of our journey. Then I read this in an email from Gender Spectrum regarding the Trump administration’s recension of important support for transgender students. “If you want to take action regarding the administration’s decision, make a commitment today to do what you can to increase understandings of gender in your world. Your story may be just what someone needs to hear. Your story can make a difference.” I’m following Gender Spectrum’s orders and asking all of you to follow me on Instagram, share my posts and tag people when the mood strikes. I envision still writing a few blog posts a month. Sharing news and things I find important on Facebook and Twitter. And, chronicling our daily lives and thoughts on Instagram. Let’s see how that plan works. I’m open to comments, thoughts, suggestions, etc. Do you want me to share the same exact thing across all three social media platforms? Do you want me to compile Instagram posts and share them on my blog, Facebook and Twitter routinely? I just don’t want you to get sick of me. Leave a comment below or shoot me an email (raisingmyrainbow@gmail.com) with your thoughts. xoxo, Lori
