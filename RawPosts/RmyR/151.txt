I\u2019m also a little wiped out from my book\u2019s release four weeks ago.\u00a0 I also get lazy periodically and may need some sort of rehab to get over my addiction to Candy Crush.\u00a0 So, please excuse my absence. Matt, Chase and C.J. made my birthday special as always.\u00a0 Matt always buys me a present and takes the boys to Target so that each of them can gift me with something that I\u2019ve always wanted.\u00a0 Then, the boys made cards for me. This if the front of my card from C.J.:  This is the inside, that\u2019s me opening up my presents.\u00a0 I have really long legs like a supermodel, according to C.J.:  This is C.J. and Chase falling down the stairs to watch me open my presents because I started opening them without them.\u00a0 I think he just wanted to draw his hair in motion: \u00a0This is the gift that C.J. picked out especially for me.\u00a0 It may look like only a cute little cupcake tchotchke, but wait there\u2019s more:  Inside is this necklace that I am wearing now with pride: \u00a0\u201cMom, how about you have the necklace and I have the cupcake?\u00a0 That sounds like a good idea, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d C.J. said persuasively. \u201cOkay,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAnd, then, when you die I can have the necklace,\u201d he said.\u00a0 That didn\u2019t help me with my feeling old problem. * * * This\u00a0Tuesday, October 8, I\u2019ll be at the Corvallis-Benton County Public Library. At 7 p.m., I will be in the Main Meeting Room.\u00a0\u00a0The event is free and open to the public.\u00a0\u00a0 Parents of gender nonconforming children are invited to a special visit with me at the library from 6 to 6:30 pm.
