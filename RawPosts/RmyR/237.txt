Picture me at an uber-fancy baby shower in Orange County. It\u2019s at a country club (because having a baby shower at a home is so pedestrian) and I\u2019m in a corner by myself eating cake pops (because cupcakes are so 2010).\u00a0 I\u2019m one of the few ladies at the event who eats food, let alone carbs, so I basically can eat pops until I pop. The mommy-to-be hasn\u2019t announced the sex of her baby prior to the baby shower.\u00a0 We were all lured there, in part, by \u201cthe thrill of being the first to know.\u201d \u201cGather round, girls,\u201d the event\u2019s hostess shouts, using her perfectly ombre-manicured hands to form a peachy-pink megaphone.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s time for the big reveal.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to announce the baby\u2019s gender now!\u201d A sea of shellacked sorority sisters squeal and shuffle to their seats. \u201cYou can\u2019t announce the gender, you don\u2019t know the gender yet, you won\u2019t know that for years and years.\u00a0 You know the sex of the baby.\u00a0 You\u2019re announcing that your baby either has a penis or a vagina.\u00a0 You have no idea what you could be in for as far as gender is concerned,\u201d I think to myself as I stuff another cake pop into my mouth, stabbing the inside of mouth in the process.\u00a0 Karma. I\u2019m the lone brunette, the lone eater, standing in the corner, growing into a crusty old broad. \u201cIT\u2019S A BOY!!!!!\u201d the mom-to-be and hostess shout simultaneously as they open the lid of an enormous box and helium-filled blue balloons float towards the ceiling signaling the high hopes they have for their boy, who they assume will grow into a man and a lover of women. \u201cIT HAS A PENIS!!!!!!\u201d I think to myself as I picture helium-filled, penis-shaped balloons filling the room and bonking the classy, hopeful women in their heads as they rise erectly to the rafters.\u00a0 I bet they haven\u2019t even considered that it may be a boy on the outside who feels like a girl on the inside or a boy who is a lover of boys. The blue balloons hang over the room decorated in yellow.\u00a0 I try not to look up. My life used to be that simple.\u00a0 I used to think that a person\u2019s sex and gender were one in the same.\u00a0 I know better now.\u00a0 Even growing up with a gay brother, a card-carrying member of the LGBTQ community, I didn\u2019t fully comprehend the possible separation of sex and gender until C.J. came along and got all gender nonconforming on us.\u00a0 I\u2019ve learned that you don\u2019t always get what you expect when you\u2019re expecting. I try to adjust my attitude.\u00a0 I have to adjust my attitude.\u00a0 For the majority of my friends, if their baby is boy he will like boy toys, the color blue, sports and the such.\u00a0 I have to let them revel in their uneducated presumptions and be happy for them.\u00a0 A baby is something to be happy about.\u00a0 It\u2019s part of my family\u2019s process to not allow ourselves to get jaded and cynical.\u00a0 We have to celebrate and support every person\u2019s individual journey. \u00a0Sometimes you have to let go of your issues in order rejoice with and for someone else.\u00a0 Let go of your issues, grab a cake pop and watch out for penis-shaped balloons.
