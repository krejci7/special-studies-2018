C.J. was immediately obsessed and we watched season eight as it aired. Since then, we\u2019ve watched seasons four, five and six for free on Amazon thanks to our Prime membership. You guys. That\u2019s 31 hours of drag queens. #summerofqueens I\u2019m having a hell of a time remembering which queens and challenges belong to which season. It\u2019s all a tucked and contoured blur at this point.  Thankfully, season two of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race All Stars started a week after we ran out of free episodes to watch. To C.J., few things in life are better than All Stars. It\u2019s like eating all of his favorite foods at one meal while wearing all of his favorite accessories. It\u2019s all of his favorite queens in the same place at the same time.  Here are C.J.\u2019s thoughts on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race All Stars, Season 2, Episode 1: I\u2019m going to be in RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race Hall of Fame one day. FYI. I was sooooo happy when I saw Detox and Adore, but my total favorite is Alaska. I had my picture taken next to Alaska\u2019s portion of the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C., because she\u2019s my favorite drag queen. The funniest part of the episode was when someone told Alaska that she looked pretty and she said that she got her look from Party City using a Groupon. I love Party City, too. I love that Adore wants to look like a Monster High Doll. I used to love Monster High Dolls. I guess I still do, kind of. I like Phi Phi\u2019s new cosplay style; it reminds me of Kim Chi\u2019s style. I love Kim Chi. I wonder if Mrs. Chi knows that Kim Chi is a drag queen yet. She probably does by now. When I saw CoCo, I said \u201cUgggghhhhhh.\u201d I don\u2019t think she will make it far. This is me watching All Stars. I love the Talent Show Extravaganza challenge idea. Especially because my second favorite show is America\u2019s Got Talent. My third favorite show is Cupcake Wars. During the talent show, the judges should have hit a big, red \u201cX\u201d if the act was bad like they do on America\u2019s Got Talent. I kept expecting that. CoCo was the worst in the talent show. No offense. Roxxxy looks better this season. When I asked my mom what \u201cburlesque dancing\u201d was she said it was \u201cold timey sexy dancing.\u201d I loved, loved, loved Alaska\u2019s song. She was the best in the talent show. Courtney Act would have done good in the talent show if she was on All Stars. But she\u2019s not. I think Adore got implants in her lips. We had to skip Tatianna\u2019s act because my Uncle Michael told my mom that it was not appropriate for me to watch. My mom wouldn\u2019t tell me what was so inappropriate about it. So, I asked my uncle and he said it was about sex. I\u2019m never going to understand the new elimination process. I don\u2019t think RuPaul should have changed it. I\u2019m also never going to remember to say, \u201cNow the time has come to lip sync for your legacy.\u201d I\u2019m too used to saying \u201cNow the time has come to lip sync for your life.\u201d Eyebrows are a lot of work. I don\u2019t think Adore was prepared for All Stars. That makes me sad for her. I hope she stays. CoCo deserved to get eliminated, if you ask me. She cannot get her face makeup right. I can\u2019t wait for the next episode! Love, C.J. (Age 9, Fourth grade, Future Drag Queen) We\u2019ve had to update our rules for watching RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. I\u2019ve been contacted by some parents who use our rules in their family, so see below for the latest version.  Current Rules C.J. Must Follow In Order To Watch RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race  All homework and chores must be done. You must watch it with your mom or dad. We don\u2019t use the words \u201cfishy\u201d or \u201cjuicy\u201d to describe people. We don\u2019t use the words \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cfuck.\u201d (Well, I do, but he\u2019s not allowed yet.) We don\u2019t use the word \u201cShe-mail.\u201d Even though RuPaul says \u201cCon-drag-ulations\u201d the real word is \u201cCongratulations\u201d and we use that. (In case it\u2019s ever on a spelling test.) We don\u2019t put glue sticks in our eyebrows until we are a little bit older or have adult supervision for the application and removal. (I\u2019m not looking forward to dealing with this mess.) We don\u2019t attempt to glue our wigs to our heads. (I wouldn\u2019t even know where to begin.) We fast forward through some \u201cShade Throwing\u201d and \u201cReading\u201d because that\u2019s not a nice way to talk to people. (I think he will eventually need to learn to throw shade, but not just yet.) As soon as the show is over, it\u2019s time to immediately sashay away to bed.
