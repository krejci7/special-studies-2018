So far he does not like third grade as much as second grade because they don\u2019t do as many crafts and when they do crafts \u201cthey are boring-er crafts.\u201d He also misses his second grade teacher Mrs. D. On the upside, he has made a new friend named Ellie who likes C.J. because his hair \u201creminds her of fried chicken.\u201d So there\u2019s that. Here are the other things that C.J. has been digging lately. Juicy Boots \u2013 When he feels like the day or event calls for something a little flashier than his standard TOMS, C.J. busts out his new Juicy Couture Boots and compliments abound much to his delight. The boots feature purple velvety, quilted hearts and glitter laces. I wish they were available in my size. We found these gems at Kohl\u2019s. Dork Diaries \u2013 A reluctant reader, C.J. has found something that he enjoys reading more than People and Us. I don\u2019t want to jinx anything, but The Dork Diary Series by Rachel Ren\u00e9e Russell may just be making a reader out of my son \u2014 and he\u2019s proud to report that so far this school year none of his peers have teased him for reading \u201ca girl\u2019s book.\u201d Other reads he\u2019s enjoyed? The Lotus Lane series and Smile, Sisters and Drama by Raina Telgemeier. Screaming Lady Backpack \u2013 I found this at Nordstrom Rack (Nordstrom Rack is one of my favorite things) and it just screamed C.J. See what I did there? It is made by Volcom, but C.J. calls it his \u201cScreaming Lady Backpack\u201d and thinks it\u2019s \u201cscary hilarious.\u201d HGTV \u2013 C.J. has officially ditched the Food Network for HGTV. Turn on Disney Channel or Nickelodeon and he\u2019ll complain; turn on HGTV and he\u2019ll sit down to give you his opinions. He prefers any show featuring a tiny house and also\u00a0House Hunters, Flip or Flop and Fixer Upper. Fixer Upper is my favorite; I want to go on a double date with Joanna and Chip right after they give my house a makeover. Pink Truck Designs \u2013 C.J.\u2019s favorite shirt of the moment is by Pink Truck Designs and features a police cruiser just like his dad drives, only in pink (C.J.\u2019s favorite color). C.J. says if he were a police officer he would want a pink cruiser (but he doesn\u2019t want to be a police officer because he wants to be an artist, he wants you to know). Pink Truck Designs is a clothing line for all ages created by a mom whose daughters love bulldozers and snowplows. Their designs are inspired by the notion that it\u2019s not just a boy thing or a girl thing \u2014 it\u2019s a kid thing!
