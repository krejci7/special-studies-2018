When I was pregnant with C.J. and we found out that we were having another boy, we created what we thought was an awesome space for him.\u00a0 Walls filled with hand-painted clouds, various street signs and car-themed bedding from Pottery Barn.\u00a0 We had been waiting for him to notice that his room didn\u2019t suit him, he did in May and I promised that once school was out, updating his room with some new furniture from 122 Design would be our summer project together.\u00a0 We had a ridiculous amount of fun doing it. \u00a0Mother/son bonding at it\u2019s best. Before: Right side of the room and C.J.\u2019s bunk beds. BTW, he prefers the bottom bunk ever since he was on the top bunk and had a run-in with the ceiling fan. Score: Ceiling Fan 1, C.J. 0 Before: Left side of the room. Snooze. PREPARE TO BE JEALOUS\u2026 After: Left side of the room. Hand painted by yours truly based on the pattern on the Monster High napkins we had at C.J.\u2019s 5th Bday bash. My hand cramped for days. After: Right side of the room. C.J. still sleeps on the bottom bunk. Score remains: Ceiling Fan 1, C.J. 0 After: Poster and frame from Wal-Mart = Super Fancy + Super Cheap After: Monster High bedding is supposedly in limited release right now and will hit stores by the end of the year, don\u2019t you think Mattel should hook C.J. up with some threads for his bed? (We\u2019ve been to EVERY Target in our county looking for the bedding, they say it\u2019s out there somewhere\u2026..I can\u2019t find it.) After: More Wal-Mart fanciness. After: Hands down C.J.\u2019s favorite part of the room makeover is this lamp. We waited all summer for it to go on sale at Target and last Thursday it happened. Our summer was complete. 1   ", "feedtitle": "Page 23 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
