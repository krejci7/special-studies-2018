I\u2019m coming out in a big way and you, my loyal readers, have had a hand in it. You shared my writings with people through social media, emails, conversations and, sometimes, during whispered interactions when you knew the other person would benefit from reading about my sparkly son.\u00a0 Because of your support I caught the attention of some pretty important people.\u00a0 Now, in less than five months, I\u2019ll be sharing our lives with a broader audience when the Random House\u2019s Broadway imprint releases Raising My Rainbow \u2014 my book based on my blog. It was with a massive amount of thought and consideration that I agreed to write the book.\u00a0 Should we risk our anonymity?\u00a0 In doing so, would we risk our safety?\u00a0 Did I even have the time to write a book while maintaining my career, our home and our children\u2019s sense of normalcy? \u00a0Did I want to be the face of a cause?\u00a0\u00a0 What would C.J. and his brother Chase think of the book now?\u00a0 What would they think of it in 10 years?\u00a0 20 years? In the end, C.J.\u2019s Dad Matt and I were and continue to be certain that a book like Raising My Rainbow is needed to encourage the world to change for the sake of gender nonconforming and LGBTQ kids.\u00a0 We have to try.\u00a0 We have to try educating as many people as we can about children like C.J. so that hopefully, growing up and thriving from childhood to adolescence and beyond is the least painful experience possible. The book is a lot like the blog.\u00a0 It gives people a glimpse into our lives in hopes that they will see that we are not weird \u2013 we are just different.\u00a0 And, different isn\u2019t bad.\u00a0 Different can and does happen to anybody.\u00a0 Your neighbor.\u00a0 Your coworker.\u00a0 Your friend.\u00a0 Your enemy.\u00a0 You. The book is about expectations.\u00a0 You don\u2019t always get what you expect when you are expecting.\u00a0 When your child is born you expect that their sex and gender will align.\u00a0 Sometimes they don\u2019t.\u00a0 You expect that your male child will like traditionally male things and that he\u2019ll be physically and emotionally attracted to a woman.\u00a0 Sometimes that doesn\u2019t happen.\u00a0 There is comfort found in expectations, but when those expectations are squashed when your child is three, four or five years old you start to question why they exist at all.\u00a0 You build new expectations and try not to be jaded when people around you hold tight to the old ones. The book is about empathy.\u00a0 It took us a while to realize that what we want most from other people is empathy.\u00a0 You don\u2019t have to fully understand gender, sex and sexuality; we just ask that you have an open heart and an open mind.\u00a0 Imagine for a minute what our child and we have to go through on a daily basis.\u00a0 What would you do if you had a child like C.J.?\u00a0 Judge less and imagine more.\u00a0 Treat others how you want to be treated.\u00a0 Period. The book is about the evolution of a family.\u00a0 When our son grabbed that first Barbie, we set out on a journey of evolution \u2013 though we didn\u2019t know it at first.\u00a0 The evolution was slow and, at times, didn\u2019t feel like it was moving forward or felt like we were fighting it.\u00a0 But, it happened; no one in our family is the same person that they were three years ago.\u00a0 Now, I wouldn\u2019t change this experience for anything in the world.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t always say that. Finally, the book is about equality.\u00a0 There\u2019s a new civil right movement happening in our country.\u00a0 It astonishes me that in 2013 we need a civil rights movement at all.\u00a0 It should be a given that all people are created equal and should be treated as such \u2013 whether it\u2019s on the playground or in the nation\u2019s capitol.\u00a0 The book is my way of taking a firm stand in the movement.\u00a0 It is my way of publicly saying that my son and brother deserve the same human rights and human decency taken for granted by the majority of the country\u2019s population.\u00a0 I want my son to be treated like a human being.\u00a0 If you can\u2019t tell if he is a boy or a girl, then just treat him like a person. As I move toward September 3 with excitement and fear, I hope that you will accompany me.\u00a0 You will never know how much you mean to my family and me.\u00a0 You all have taught me the difference between sex and gender; you have taught me how to parent an LGBTQ child; you have taught me how to get lipgloss out of my son\u2019s hair when one particular makeover went awry; and the list goes on and on. The blog will continue to exist as an outlet for me.\u00a0 Will I only be Lori now?\u00a0 No, I\u2019m also C.J.\u2019s Mom.\u00a0 Which names will I use?\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure.\u00a0 I have to see what feels comfortable. Will there be identifying photos of our family on the blog now?\u00a0 Nope.\u00a0 I\u2019ll continue to amaze you with my nondescript iPhone photography skills.\u00a0 Will I keep you updated on book news from now on?\u00a0 You betcha. For us, life continues to be an adventure.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad that you are along for the ride.\u00a0 I hope that you continue to be.\u00a0 Wish me luck and buy my book and thank you, thank you, thank you for being such a rad blogosphere family. xoxo, Lori Duron/C.J\u2019s Mom/Blogger/Author/Candlestick Maker   ", "feedtitle": "Page 19 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
