 I recently had the honor of working with PFLAG on their new publication titled Our Trans Loved Ones. It’s an amazing resource for parents, families and friends of people who are transgender and gender expansive. Our Trans Loved Ones is free and includes a wealth of information, first-person stories, expert input and more. Download it, love it and share it. ‪#‎OurTransLovedOnes
