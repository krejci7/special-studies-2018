I called her to announce that C.J. had finally lost the first of his top two front teeth. That tooth had hung on for way too long and she cheered when she heard the news. Little life victories are meant to be celebrated with Nanas. A few hours later, Nana passed away and I spent Memorial Day painfully and tearfully recalling every memory of my mother that I could conjure up, afraid that they would perish with her. I would never wish a long painful death on anyone, but the shock of a sudden and unexpected death seems unfair too. I guess there\u2019s no perfect way to die. As my brother Michael and I left our mom for the last time, I leaned over her, kissed her forehead and whispered. \u201cI love you, mom. You are the best.\u201d It was the first time she didn\u2019t refute my praise. She didn\u2019t say, \u201coh, no I\u2019m not.\u201d I wanted her to brush off my compliment. I wanted her to open her eyes. I wanted her heart to beat and her lungs to breathe and for the previous hours to have been a sick joke the universe would someday apologize for thinking was funny. If I was being tested, I wanted to pass the test and get my mother back. We left the hospital and my body trembled all the way home; knowing that I would walk through the door and rip Chase and C.J.\u2019s hearts in half quickly and cruelly. As Michael, Matt and I told them that Nana\u2019s body had stopped working, I looked into their eyes and watched a jarring life moment confuse them. I watched their sense of reality go into a dizzying spiral. They had seen Nana three days earlier. We ate Chinese food and saw Annie at the local performing arts center. She was happy and smiling in a blue sequined top and her favorite perfume. For a second, Chase thought we were kidding and C.J. struggled to catch up. And, then it started to sink in. \u201cCan we see her again and say goodbye?\u201d they asked. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but you can\u2019t,\u201d we said. \u201cWho\u2019s going to play dress up with me and let me do their makeup and do crafts with me?\u201d C.J. cried. \u201cWe all do those things with you and we will never stop,\u201d we promised. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same. It\u2019s not Nana,\u201d he said. The rest of that day and the next passed, though I have little recollection. We began planning Nana\u2019s Celebration of Life and explained the event\u2019s significance to C.J. and Chase. \u201cWhat are we going to wear to the Celebration of Life?\u201d C.J. asked immediately, because even when grieving he is concerned about fashion. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a tie,\u201d said Chase, who loves any excuse to wear a tie. \u201cI want to be a girl at Nana\u2019s Celebration of Life. I want to wear a dress. That\u2019s how Nana would want me,\u201d he declared and asked if we could go shopping. I promised him we would. \u201cWill everyone at the Celebration of Life know that I\u2019m gender nonconforming?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 I waited for the usual self-editing and deep consideration about his gender expression around new people to begin. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a dress.\u201d And, so we went shopping for a dress for my son to wear to my mother\u2019s funeral.
