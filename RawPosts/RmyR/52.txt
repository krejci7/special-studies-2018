I\u2019ve officially added her latest book (released this month) to that list. The Gender Creative Child: Pathways for Nurturing and Supporting Children Who Live Outside Gender Boxes is another must-read from the person I\u2019ve called the patron saint of kids who don\u2019t conform to traditional gender norms. Dr. Ehrensaft explains gender and children like no one can. And, in her new book, she equips adults to understand and support gender-expansive children the way they deserve to be. I\u2019m often asked how an adult can tell if a child is transgender or gender creative (gender nonconforming). Because I\u2019m not an expert, I typically don\u2019t know the child and giving the wrong answer could seriously impact the child\u2019s life, I\u2019m always hesitant to give my feedback. I do say that when he was younger, C.J. would say \u201cI wish I was a girl\u201d and \u201cI want to be a girl.\u201d As many times as people told me that those phrases meant he was transgender, my mom-gut told me that wasn\u2019t the case. There\u2019s a difference between wanting to be something and genuinely feeling like you are something. Of course Dr. Ehrensaft explains it better in what was, for me, the most impactful part of The Gender Creative Child. \u201cOne simple verb will also be one of the signposts that can differentiate a young transgender child from other gender creative children. It is the verb to be. Children who are communicating to us their transgender self will often say, \u201cI am a\u2026(fill in opposite gender or some other gender)\u201d rather than \u201cI wish I were a\u2026\u201d or \u201cI want to be a\u2026\u201d This is not universally true\u2026.but for those children who feel no necessity to hedge their bets to appease others or who have met with no confused or disapproving responses, the simple sentence \u201cI am a\u2026\u201d is a very clear signpost identifying a child who is not the gender people they are.\u201d Want to read more?
