My sons fell in love with Goss instantly because he sings, plays guitar and can do flips on a trampoline. I fell in love with Goss because of his voice, his LGBTQ advocacy work and because he overflows with kindness. When he allowed me a sneak peak of the music video for his new song \u201cBreath & Sound,\u201d its beauty, simplicity and powerful message held me captive. \u201cBreath & Sound\u201d illustrates through lyrical dance that the act of falling in love and the cadence of a relationship is the same for all couples, regardless of sexual orientation, gender or color. I recently sat\u00a0down with Goss to talk about\u00a0\u201cBreath & Sound\u201d for HuffPost Gay Voices. Me:\u00a0With the Supreme Court\u2019s June ruling in favor of marriage equality, the timing couldn\u2019t be better for this video\u2019s release, don\u2019t you think? Tom Goss:\u00a0Yes! It\u2019s amazing to see how this country has grown and evolved in terms of its acceptance of all kinds of love. We are experiencing a momentous time; but that\u2019s not to say the work is done. We have to continue to have an open dialogue to live harmoniously; I hope that my music and videos like this one encourage that dialogue. Me:\u00a0What do you hope the LGBTQ community will feel when they watch this video? Tom:\u00a0I want them to feel like I\u2019m telling their story. I want them to be moved. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this. There isn\u2019t enough LGBTQ content being produced. Historically, people have been afraid to tell these stories \u2013 but I\u2019m not. I will always use my voice to help tell the stories of those who cannot. Me:\u00a0What do you hope people outside of the LGBTQ community feel when they watch it? Tom:\u00a0I want them to understand the boundlessness of love. There\u2019s a reason the first verse focuses on the straight couple alone \u2014 that\u2019s what they are used to seeing. I want straight people to be drawn into a familiar story, one they understand and relate to. Once there, I want to show them that this exact same story is being lived by the LGBTQ community. As a gay man, I don\u2019t want special privilege. I just want to love \u2013 passionately, fearlessly and completely. Me:\u00a0How did you come up with the initial concept for this video? Tom:\u00a0I\u2019ve been dreaming about this video for years. As soon as we recorded the song I knew I wanted to shoot a lyrical dance because I\u2019m fascinated by movement and even more so by collaborative projects. About six months ago I was explaining my vision to director Michael Serrato (Big Gay Sketch Show; Willam Belli and Violet Chachki music videos; and\u00a0Neil\u2019s Puppet Dreams). I told him about my big, complex, beautiful \u2014 but ultimately flawed idea \u2014 and he started getting as excited as I was and sharing ideas of his own. His ideas solved the problems I was having in the story and it became clear that it was something that we could accomplish together. Me:\u00a0The dance is such a beautiful metaphor for the flow of a relationship\u2026 Tom:\u00a0If you think about it, all relationships are really a kind of dance. We want to be close to somebody, but we\u2019re afraid to let them too close. We come together, we push each other away. We chose the movements to highlight that experience. This feeling isn\u2019t confined to one specific kind of relationship; it doesn\u2019t understand gender or sexual orientation. The dance of attraction and love is a universal one. The dance is the same regardless of the dancers. Me:\u00a0At first watch, the video looks simple and effortless, but then I got to thinking about the choreography, editing and about how sometimes making something seem simple is very hard work. What was the hardest part about making the video? Tom:\u00a0The hardest part wasn\u2019t on my shoulders, but on the dancers\u2019. It was inspiring to see how connected they became to each other throughout shooting. Everyone involved believed in the concept, the song and its potential to spur something beautiful. They committed to me, Michael and each other \u2014 helping build something greater than the sum of its parts. Me:\u00a0What other great projects are you working on? Tom:\u00a0I\u2019m in pre-production on a video addressing LGBTQ youth and suicide prevention. I\u2019m extremely excited about the team we are building for this project. I believe it has the potential to reach a lot of people. More than anything, I want to help make the world a better place. I think this video will do just that.
