 To grandmother’s house we go. #14hourdrive #cabinfever Back in April I was contacted by Ravali Reddy, a super-smarty student at Stanford University who is an undergraduate communication major (class of 2014, whoot whoot!) and a huge fan of Raising My Rainbow. She wanted to write about our family as a narrative story for the magazine journalism course in which she was enrolled.  I’m a former communication major myself, at a school much lesser-known than Stanford, one with a religious affiliation that might disown me as an alumni if they found out about this blog.  I kindly obliged the request and granted Ravali access to our family that I had never given any member of the media before or since.  I’m glad I did.  Click here to read her finished piece.   My boys fell in love with Ravali — it probably had something to do with the fancy kites she gave them and the carousel rides she took them on.  They are not above bribery. We’re visiting Grandma and Grandpa Colorado, so you may not hear from me for a week or so — partly because I’m going to chill during my vay-cay and partly because they are apparently in the running for the world’s slowest wi-fi and, frankly, I don’t have the patience to upload a post plus pictures.  It’s like watching paint dry, water heat to a boil, Lindsey Lohan try to stay sober. Cheers from an unpaved road near the Continental Divide, C.J.’s Mom
