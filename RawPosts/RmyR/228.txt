Our fearless leader tries to keep us on track, but it\u2019s no easy task. As we went around the conference room reporting our various works in progress we got off topic (per the usual) and started talking about the guy who works on our floor in another division of the company who yells at himself (or some figment of his imagination) during the breaks he takes in the back parking lot.\u00a0 Everybody laughed.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never seen him; I\u2019m not full-time, so I miss a lot of the good stuff, like employee appreciation breakfasts, white elephant gift exchanges and, apparently, solo tirades that are growing increasingly alarming. \u201cOh, and what about the she/he?!\u201d someone said. My heart got hot.\u00a0 I held my breath.\u00a0 I knew who they were talking about.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cOh my god. I know!!!!\u00a0 A year or so ago \u201cit\u201d was using the women\u2019s restroom and washing \u201cher\u201d or \u201chis\u201d or \u201cwhatever\u201d hands next to me, and the other day I saw \u201cit\u201d using the men\u2019s room!\u00a0 I wonder if \u201ctheir\u201d boss knows about that?\u201d a co-worker said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with that?! Did she/he get permission to switch bathrooms?\u201d someone else asked. \u201cEwwww, that is so wrong.\u00a0 Just pick one, man, are you a guy or a girl?!\u201d said one of the men in our department. A co-worker who knows more about C.J. than most people looked at me in alarmed sympathy. I felt like everyone in the room was talking about my son. I felt the need to speak up for the, what I\u2019m educated-guessing to be, female to male transgender person down the hall.\u00a0 But part of me wanted to say nothing.\u00a0 It used to be easier to say nothing, now it\u2019s not. I looked at my grossed-out coworker guy.\u00a0 At the last staff meeting, he showed us pictures of himself holding his\u00a0newborn son.\u00a0 He has no idea if that sweet baby in his arms\u2019 gender and sex align. He could be holding a gender nonconforming child or a transgender or transsexual little being.\u00a0 He has no idea what he could be in for.\u00a0 No new parents do. \u201cHE appears to be a female to male transgender person,\u201d I said, my heart racing as every eye turned to look at me.\u00a0 I\u2019m usually light-hearted at work, the person to crack jokes while working my ass off.\u00a0 I\u2019m serious about my work, but not my demeanor.\u00a0 I caught most of the people in the room off guard with my serious tone. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d someone asked. \u201cTransgender means that a person\u2019s sex, what\u2019s in their pants, and their gender, what\u2019s in their brain, don\u2019t match up.\u00a0 It happens during the person\u2019s creation.\u00a0 He is actually brave for transitioning from presenting as a female to presenting as a male,\u201d I said. Crickets.\u00a0 All eyes on me.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never been that serious with this group in my life.\u00a0 The grossed-out coworker guy with the newborn gave me a disgusted look. Then the person next up to report on their workload broke the silence with a list of assignments.\u00a0 I wanted to leave the room.\u00a0 Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have said anything. \u201cThat was so awkward!\u201d I said to my C.J.-loving department friend later in the day. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said sympathetically. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard. I feel like I have to educate people and stick up for people like C.J.\u00a0 I can\u2019t just sit back,\u201d I said. \u201cI know.\u201d Sometimes I feel safe in certain places.\u00a0 Like they are separate from my family life of gender issues.\u00a0 I felt that way at work.\u00a0 Few know about C.J.\u2019s creativeness with gender.\u00a0 Work was a place where I could let it all go the most.\u00a0 When my two worlds collided it felt overwhelming.\u00a0 I went home and told C.J.\u2019s Dad about the staff meeting.\u00a0 It was still really bothering me.\u00a0 My grossed-out coworker guy with the newborn was still bothering me. \u201cYou know, you don\u2019t always have to be an advocate. People say shit about gays and lesbians and trans people all the time at my work, I just have to ignore them because I\u2019m not going to get into it. I\u2019m not going to let them know about my son. They don\u2019t deserve to,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad said. I can\u2019t do that.\u00a0 I wish it were that easy.\u00a0 I never thought I\u2019d be an advocate for anything.\u00a0 It seemed exhausting. Now I know that I was wrong and right.\u00a0 I was wrong.\u00a0 I would become an advocate.\u00a0 I was right.\u00a0 It is exhausting.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 23 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
