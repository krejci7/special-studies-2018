She wanted to write about our family as a narrative story for the magazine journalism course in which she was enrolled.\u00a0 I\u2019m a former communication major myself, at a school much lesser-known than Stanford, one with a religious affiliation that might disown me as an alumni if they found out about this blog.\u00a0 I kindly obliged the request and granted Ravali access to our family that I had never given any member of the media before or since.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad I did.\u00a0\u00a0Click here to read her finished piece. \u00a0 My boys fell in love with Ravali \u2014 it probably had something to do with the fancy kites she gave them and the carousel rides she took them on.\u00a0 They are not above bribery. We\u2019re visiting Grandma and Grandpa Colorado, so you may not hear from me for a week or so \u2014 partly because I\u2019m going to chill during my vay-cay and partly because they are apparently in the running for the world\u2019s slowest wi-fi and, frankly, I don\u2019t have the patience to upload a post plus pictures.\u00a0 It\u2019s like watching paint dry, water heat to a boil, Lindsey Lohan try to stay sober.
