It was so nice to spend time one-on-one with my oldest son. My hubby also liked having alone time to bond with C.J. Mental note: If it\u2019s so good for the family, I\u2019ll have to vacay in exotic locales more often. A trip to the ABC Store proved fruitful as always. We arrived home bearing gifts: chocolate covered macadamia nuts, Kona coffee, key chains, necklaces with shark teeth and a hula dancer costume for our dress-up collection.  The grass skirt, lei and top have required I add a few lines to the list of Things I Never Thought I\u2019d Say To My Son: \u2022 Daddy can\u2019t have another hula lesson right now, he\u2019s grilling dinner. \u2022 No, I don\u2019t have any boobies to give you to put in the bikini top. \u2022 You can\u2019t wear the grass skirt in the pool or it will get ruined. \u2022 Yes, you look like a real hula girl. \u2022 I\u2019m sorry but your brother is right, your skirt does stink.
