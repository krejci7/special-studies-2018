I wish all of you lived on our street; we could have some pretty crazy block parties. A lot of you suggested ways to connect with other families like ours. Three cheers for PFLAG! I do attend meetings locally, when I can get a babysitter. I walk away from every meeting feeling so hopeful.\u00a0\u00a0  Another popular suggestion was the annual Gender Spectrum Conference.\u00a0 And, wouldn\u2019t you know, they reached out to me as well. I can\u2019t attend this year\u2019s conference, but I\u2019m looking forward to attending next year.  Here\u2019s more info for those of you who don\u2019t already have big, glamorous plans for July 29 through August 1. A little birdy\u00a0told me that scholarships are still available. You should look into that. That same birdy\u00a0should be advised that I\u2019ll need a scholarship next year. Thanks-sies! CALLING ALL GENDER NON-CONFORMING YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES!
