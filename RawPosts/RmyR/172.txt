That\u2019s C.J. in the lower left-hand corner, in case you didn\u2019t recognize him. He was wearing extra mascara that day. I\u2019m sad and anxious, as I have been at the end of every one of C.J.\u2019s school years. \u00a0I don\u2019t know what to expect next.\u00a0 Who will his teacher be?\u00a0 Who will his classmates be?\u00a0 Who will accept his gender creativity?\u00a0 Who will make him feel small because he likes girl stuff big time? C.J.\u2019s kindergarten year was amazing.\u00a0 His teacher, Ms. Valentine, deserves much of the credit.\u00a0 She greeted him on the first day with her big blue eyes, perfect blonde hair, sweet smile and leopard-print shoes.\u00a0 She knew who he was.\u00a0 He was the gender nonconforming boy.\u00a0 The boy who likes girl stuff.\u00a0 The boy whose mom is sometimes seen as a liability\u2026what, with her blog and all. Ms. Valentine had, as I hoped, read the letter that I wrote to her and posted on my blog days before school started.\u00a0 She took it all in with an open heart and an open mind. I met with her early on to talk about C.J., his gender nonconformity and how it all affects his learning and time at school.\u00a0 She was kind, optimistic and excited to have him in her class.\u00a0 C.J. was safe in her care; I knew it from moment number one. \u201cDoes my teacher know that I like girl stuff?\u201d C.J. asked every day for weeks leading up to the first day of school and for a few weeks after it started. \u201cMs. Valentine?\u00a0 Yes, baby, she knows,\u201d I reassured him. \u201cWhat did she say about it?\u201d \u201cShe thinks it\u2019s awesome.\u201d C.J. smiled that red-haired, freckled-nose, dimpled-cheek smile that always makes me smile too.\u00a0 He loves it when people know and accept that he is gender nonconforming. The first day of school, Ms. Valentine started a new tradition of not lining the students up by sex.\u00a0 There would be no \u201cboys\u2019 line\u201d or \u201cgirls\u2019 line\u201d in C.J.\u2019s class.\u00a0 She winked at me.\u00a0 I smiled and nodded my head in gratitude. All of the other moms struggled with the concept.\u00a0 They had a hard time comprehending what was happening.\u00a0 If there wasn\u2019t a line for girls and a line for boys how would anybody function?\u00a0 How would the kids walk into the classroom and around campus?\u00a0 How would the earth continue to spin?\u00a0 For the first week of school the other moms tried to divide the lines based on genitals every morning.\u00a0 And, every morning Ms. Valentine would remind them that she was doing things differently this year. C.J. instantly felt safe in Ms. Valentine\u2019s presence.\u00a0 She had pretty hair, sassy shoes and she smelled good.\u00a0 He was sold. That\u2019s C.J. in the middle. Looks like he has fresh low-lights and a sleek blow-out. He spent the year self-editing more than ever.\u00a0 Not prompted by anyone \u2014 not us, not Ms. Valentine.\u00a0 It was totally his decision.\u00a0 I had been told that gender nonconforming kids start to conform more once they enter kindergarten.\u00a0 C.J. did just that at school.\u00a0 At home he remained our sparkly son. In kindergarten, he drew himself as a boy for the first time in his life.\u00a0 He decided at the last minute not to wear his Rapunzel pajamas on Pajama Day.\u00a0 He stopped wearing the necklaces and bracelets that he beads in his free time. He did, however, continue to wear \u201cgirl socks\u201d every day tucked into his \u201cgirl shoes.\u201d\u00a0 His Monster High lunchbox is thrashed from a year of daily use.\u00a0 And, he got plenty of compliments the day he wore his purple, glittered Wicked t-shirt to school. He hated the week when he was \u201cSpecial Bear.\u201d\u00a0 Five days were all about him and he was supposed to share about himself, his family and his home life every day. \u00a0He didn\u2019t want to.\u00a0 He has his public self and his private self.\u00a0 Sometimes the two overlap, but sometimes he doesn\u2019t want them to.\u00a0 And, that\u2019s fine. He did, however, love the Mother\u2019s Day fashion show when we got to walk the runway in his purple plaid shirt, magenta bow tie and pink boat shoes for everyone to see.\u00a0 It was his first legit catwalk and it felt like home. If you ask him, he\u2019ll tell you that his favorite subjects in kindergarten were playing on the playground with his friends and doing crafts.\u00a0 It\u2019s the academic portion of school that he struggled with. Old Mac C.J. made a farm. You see, when your focus is on self-editing and self-preservation, learning your ABCs and 123s don\u2019t seem important.\u00a0 He\u2019s concerned about being teased about liking girl stuff and not about identifying numbers one through 30 out of sequence.\u00a0 In the end he qualified to move on to first grade.\u00a0 He meets state requirements, but there was the option of having him repeat kindergarten. His dad and I had to struggle with the decision to push him onward and upward or hold him back.\u00a0 A mom who I met through PFLAG told me that her therapist believes that LGBTQ kids are usually a year behind their peers academically because they are having to deal with all-consuming social and life issues while staying on top of school work.\u00a0 It can seem overwhelming. I\u2019ve also had people tell me that LGBTQ youth are typically more gifted than their peers. Who knows who is right? In September C.J. will strut into first grade; into an unfamiliar classroom helmed by a teacher who we do not know.\u00a0 Will she have an open heart and an open mind?\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s all we ask for.\u00a0 But, we\u2019ve come to realize that those are two big things to ask of someone.\u00a0 It shouldn\u2019t be that way, but it is. Whoever C.J.\u2019s first grade teacher is, we hold out hope that s/he will be as great as Ms. Valentine has been.\u00a0 We also hope that Ms. Valentine has a bitchin\u2019 summer and that she\u2019ll K.I.T.
