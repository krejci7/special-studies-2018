 Thank you all so much for the birthday wishes.  The birthday boy is now snuggled in bed wearing his new Disney Princess nightgown clutching his two new Monster High Dolls. The big party is tomorrow; wish us luck and be on the lookout for pictures next week. * * * In honor of C.J.’s sixth birthday, the winner of last week’s coloring book giveaway (One of Kind Colouring Book 1. Surprise Box) is the sixth person to enter by commenting on that blog post.  Congratulations are in order for Sofia, who wanted the coloring book for her daughter who loves dinosaurs and enjoys wearing clothes from the “boy side” of department stores. * * * From time to time readers contact me hoping that I can help them meet other gender creative families in their area.   If you are in the following areas and looking to connect with other families raising a gender nonconforming child, email me at raisingmyrainbow@gmail.com.
