The Birthday Boy\u2019s tiara\u2026and some for his friends. C.J. and I made cupcakes for his guests. I usually pin crafts to my Pinterest board and never actually make them. Not this time! C.J. and I folded hearts using pages from the Pottery Barn Kids catalog and strung them together to make garland. \u00a0This photo doesn\u2019t do our work justice. \u00a0 The Birthday Boy\u2019s outfit. He decided to ditch the leg warmers and opt for his silver heels over his purple bejeweled ballet flats. We hadn\u2019t intended for jumping on the trampoline to be a part of the party, but it\u2019s hard to resist a good bounce. \u00a0 This was the first year that C.J. didn\u2019t receive a single \u201cboy toy.\u201d He\u2019s really digging the new La Dee Da dolls. His favorite gift of all\u2026Uncle Uncle got a headband with a blonde braid attached, purchased extensions of real hair and hand sewed them onto the braided headband. C.J. can have long, blonde \u201cgirl hair\u201d whenever he wants. The day after the party, C.J. bounced in his new dress that, according to him, makes him look like a teenager and his couture headband. \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 21 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
