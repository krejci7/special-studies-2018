Me: He doesn\u2019t even know what he\u2019s in for. I am ridiculously excited. Friend: It\u2019s gonna be life-changing. My friend was right \u2014 probably because if he lived closer and were 30 years younger, he and C.J. would be inseparable and a fierce force to be reckoned with. I waited weeks for the Olympics to get underway and set the DVR to record.\u00a0 Over the weekend, Matt and I sat down with our sons to watch the games. Chase loved the snowboarding and skiing events.\u00a0 C.J. only loved them when somebody crashed. \u00a0\u00a0Which is rude, but honest, I guess. When figure skating came on, I watched C.J. \u201cIs this still the Olympics?\u201d he asked confused.\u00a0 How could we have possibly gone from barreling down a mountain on a board to dancing gracefully on glimmering ice? We were watching Meryl Davis and Charlie White compete for the U.S. \u201cAre they in love?\u201d C.J. asked me. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d \u201cIf they kiss we\u2019ll know for sure that they are in love,\u201d he assured me.\u00a0 They never kissed.\u00a0 They must not be in love. Photo: Ottowa Sun We watched Canada\u2019s Kaetlyn Osmond perform. \u201cShe\u2019s really good,\u201d I said when she was finished.\u00a0 Stating the obvious. \u201cWell, she\u2019s 18, what do you expect?!\u201d he said as he turned to give me an exasperated look.\u00a0 When he took his eyes off of the screen the judges delivered her results. \u201cGo back, go back, go back!\u00a0 I want to see her skirt and her score!\u201d I grabbed my laptop and pulled up the video of Jason Brown\u2019s long program at the U.S. National Championships last month. \u201cWait.\u00a0 A.\u00a0 Minute.\u00a0 I love his ponytail and glitter costume.\u00a0 I like his style,\u201d C.J. exclaimed. He watched the video, entranced for seven minutes and 22 seconds.\u00a0 At one point he was clapping as he watched. \u201cWhat are they throwing at him?!\u201d he asked at the end. \u201cFlowers.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cCause they liked him so much.\u201d \u201cAwwwwwwwwweeeeeee\u2026\u2026.\u201d Photo: Getty Images At night, while C.J. was in bed, I watched Jason Brown skate the same performance at the Olympics.\u00a0 It was perfect, except that he had a small fall.\u00a0 My heart broke, for Jason and my son. The next night C.J. wanted to watch Jason Brown at the Olympics, so I turned it on.\u00a0 C.J. watched the television and I watched C.J. Jason fell. \u201cWhat?\u00a0 What was that?!\u00a0 What just happened?\u00a0 Was that part of the routine?\u201d C.J asked not taking his eyes off of the screen. \u201cNo, he fell.\u00a0 And, then he picked himself up and kept on going. \u201cWell, it\u2019s okay, maybe nobody noticed.\u00a0 Yeah, maybe nobody noticed.\u00a0 Maybe everybody thought that was one of his fancy tricks,\u201d C.J. said trying assure himself that everything was going to be okay. It was time for Jason\u2019s score.\u00a0 153 point something. \u201cWell that\u2019s good.\u00a0 Anything over 100 is really good because 100 is a lot.\u201d C.J.\u2019s hand was on his chest in relief.\u00a0 We know nothing about figure skating scoring, but Jason was smiling and seemed happy so we were too. My friend Nerdy Apple sent us a video of Jason Brown skating at the Olympics with fart noises strategically overlaid.\u00a0 Farting Figure Skating.\u00a0 I tried to show it to only Chase, but Chase was laughing so loudly that nosey C.J. came running downstairs inquiring about what was so funny. \u201cShow him, show him, you\u2019ve got to show him!\u201d Chase said through a crying, pee-your-pants laughter. I showed C.J. \u201cIs that for real?\u00a0 Was he farting the whole time?\u201d he asked very seriously. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a joke.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t farting.\u201d It took a minute for him to accept it and get over the shock. \u00a0Then he smiled. \u201cPlay it again,\u201d he said. I did and he laughed too. \u00a0 A fart joke aficionado, C.J. now loves Jason Brown even more.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
