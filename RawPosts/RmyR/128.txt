You must read the report. \u00a0It\u2019s devastating and will show you that we need to do better \u2014 we have to do better \u2014 for the sake of differently gendered kids. And, if you have time, ready my essay, here\u2019s an excerpt: \u201cSometimes (C.J.) dulls his sparkle because others don\u2019t know what to make of it.\u00a0 He\u2019s had people hurl homophobic slurs at him.\u00a0 He\u2019s had peers in the school bathroom try to see if he has a penis or vagina.\u00a0 He\u2019s had adults tell him to stop being a sissy and to \u201cman up.\u201d\u00a0 Today, he was told to \u201cgo jump off of the Tyler Clementi Memorial Bridge.\u201d\u00a0 All because my seven-year-old boy likes pink more than blue, dolls more than trucks, skirts more than pants. It\u2019s scary raising a child; it\u2019s even scarier raising a gender nonconforming child\u2026. Imagine raising a child who \u2014 according to the survey \u2013 will feel less happy than their peers; is more likely to experiment with drugs and alcohol; views their life goals as unachievable; believes they have to leave home in order to be accepted; feels unsafe at school; and finds religion to be unloving.\u201d * * * Here are two fundraising campaigns that you might be interested in: QUIRKIE KIDS is hoping to raise $2,500 in the next 30 days to launch a line of pink tees for girls AND boys with playful designs not normally associated with the color pink. QUIRKIE KIDS believes that all kids should be free to wear pink and is working and gives kids more options to express themselves through their clothing. \u00a0Click here to check out the campaign. The documentary Inside Out has also launched a 30-day funding blitz.\u00a0 They are asking 80,000 caring people to donate $10 (the price of a movie ticket) to fund the first feature film to go deep inside the lives of transgender and gender non-conforming children and their families. By following the journeys of five children over one year audiences will understand their hopes, fears and\u2014 often difficult\u2014 decisions. Inside Out puts a human face on these stories and, in doing so, inspires empathy, increases awareness and broadens the public\u2019s understanding of people. \u00a0Click here to learn more and/or donate.
