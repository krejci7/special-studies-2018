One workshop that I was really looking forward to attending at this summer\u2019s Gender Spectrum conference was titled \u201cHelping Your Gender Variant Child With Teasing\u201d and presented by Darlene Tando, LCSW.\u00a0 Darlene had to cancel her presentation at the last minute due to a family emergency; which left me and many other conference attendees feeling bummed.\u00a0 To make us feel better, Tando outlined and summarized her presentation and posted it here.\u00a0 Thanks, Darlene!\u00a0 Hope you and your family are okay and that we get to see you next year at Gender Spectrum. * * * Twirl, C.J.\u2019s Brother and C.J.
