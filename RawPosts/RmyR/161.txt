 Tell C.J. to draw a cat and this is what you get. One workshop that I was really looking forward to attending at this summer’s Gender Spectrum conference was titled “Helping Your Gender Variant Child With Teasing” and presented by Darlene Tando, LCSW.  Darlene had to cancel her presentation at the last minute due to a family emergency; which left me and many other conference attendees feeling bummed.  To make us feel better, Tando outlined and summarized her presentation and posted it here.  Thanks, Darlene!  Hope you and your family are okay and that we get to see you next year at Gender Spectrum. * * * Twirl, C.J.’s Brother and C.J. If you read Part I of the adventures of C.J. and his BFF Twirl last month, check out the second and final installment.  It features pancakes, a sunny day in Laguna Beach and a teary, hug-filled goodbye.  So, basically, you’re not going to want to miss it. Also, you know how some little boys have a mind for sports stats?  Twirl has a mind for all things Project Runway.  Hear what he has to say here. * * * Last weekend I experienced two big firsts.  I attended my first pride and gave my first book reading.  Thanks, OC Pride for having me.  And, thank you to everybody who came out to support me and get a sneak peek inside my book.  The room was packed – which made me feel so humbled and honored. After the reading, C.J.’s Dad and I experienced our first pride festival.  Where he got several looks and waves and I got a new HRC t-shirt. Pre-order the Raising My Rainbow book!
