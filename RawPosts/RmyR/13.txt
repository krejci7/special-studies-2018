Click here for all of the months\u2019 pictures, thoughts and happenings. If you\u2019re on Instagram, follow me. If you already follow me, thanks! \u00a0I love my brother and am so thankful for him. He watched the boys all weekend so Matt and I could sneak away to Seattle with friends. He helped Chase host a pool party, took him shopping for school supplies, got him a haircut and took him to his first high school dance. He introduced CJ to *Birdcage* and *The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert* and bought him his first curling iron. He had a pork roast and mashed potatoes waiting for us when we got home. I learned how to parent an LGBTQ child by watching my parents raise Michael and doing the opposite of what they did. Matt and I aren\u2019t alone in raising our boys; Uncle Michael is with us every step of the way. He loves the boys, he worries about them, celebrates them and spoils them. The boys see him as equal parts fun parent and loyal best friend. If you don\u2019t have an Uncle Michael in your life, you should get one. \u00a0 \u201cDavid was threatening because it was a different consciousness. Whatever you want to call it \u2014 the feminization of the male or whatever it was \u2014 us boy/girls were a threat.\u201d \u2014 Mick Rock, David Bowie\u2019s official photographer. Matt and I visited the Museum of Pop Culture while in Seattle this weekend. The \u201cBowie by Mick Rock\u201d exhibit was my favorite. I read this quote over and over. Back then, boy/girls were a threat. Today boy/girls are a threat. When will boy/girls stop being a threat? First writing prompt of the 5th grade: How would you spend one million dollars? \u201cI would love to spend one million $. First, I would travel. I would travel to Hawaii and New York City. Next, I would spend some money on clothes, such as designer bags and designer hats. Finally, I would go shopping. I would buy a curling iron and a lot of makeup. I would love to spend a million $.\u201d (By CJ, age 10) Please note: The paragraph was written before Uncle Michael bought him his first curling iron. So, CJ\u2019s dreams are already coming true. \u00a0 \u201cA bunch of people ask me how I can possibly be so awesome. I tell them, \u2018in the words of Lady Gaga, I was born this way\u2019.\u201d \u2014 CJ, age 10. For the record, I\u2019ve never heard anyone, let alone \u201ca bunch\u201d of people, ask him how he can possibly be so awesome. But I\u2019m glad he has a standard answer, I guess. \u00a0 CJ scored these roller skates last time we went antiquing. Like every 10-year-old boy, antiquing is one of his favorite weekend activities. He felt that $12 was a steal for these skates because \u2013 according to the label \u2013 they are \u201cofficial roller derby skates.\u201d $12 is a good price for anything that\u2019s \u201cofficial,\u201d he told me. When I was CJ\u2019s age, one of my favorite weekend activities was getting my brother and his boom box out to the front yard so we could choreograph roller skating routines like we were in Xanadu. #likeunclelikenephew \u00a0 \u201cMom, I\u2019m going to do this to you and two of your girlfriends. You just all sit close together and I\u2019m gonna braid your hair together in one big braid. It will be fun and awesome.\u201d \u2014 CJ, age 10 \u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t worry, mom. I already warned my teacher that if I\u2019m tired today it\u2019s because I was at a music video premiere at the YouTube Space in LA last night,\u201d CJ. \u00a0 CJ is the biggest fan of his own fashion designs. To make your own pair of \u201cgay shorts inspired by the boys who were at pride,\u201d cut off a pair of jeans, hem them, add some embroidery detail and attach suspenders. Voila! Then, try to wear them every day and have an attitude when your mom says you can\u2019t. Be courageous. \u00a0 \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
