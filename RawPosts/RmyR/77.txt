And those were our only two options. As we began planning, Uncle Michael, Matt and I explained the event\u2019s significance to C.J. and Chase. \u201cWhat are we going to wear to the Celebration of Life?\u201d C.J. asked immediately, because even when grieving he is concerned about fashion. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a tie,\u201d said Chase, who loves any excuse to wear a tie. \u201cI want to be a girl at Nana\u2019s Celebration of Life. I want to wear a dress. That\u2019s how Nana would want me,\u201d he declared and asked if we could go shopping. I promised him we would. \u201cWill everyone at the Celebration of Life know that I\u2019m gender nonconforming?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 I waited for the usual self-editing and deep consideration about his gender expression around new people to begin. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a dress.\u201d \u201cThat sounds good,\u201d we said. He could have said he was going to dress up like a dragon or be a dandelion and we would have said it sounded good \u2014 because a sudden death of a loved one puts things into perspective (and because the Celebration of Life would be casual, loving and accepting, like Nana was). Every day, C.J. pressured me to take him shopping for a new dress and every day I told him that we needed to wait until Uncle Michael got back in town. I was physically and emotionally spent and didn\u2019t feel well-equipped to help my son pick out a dress for his grandmother\u2019s funeral. I had spent loads of energy getting the funeral planned and her visit site properly cared for. I needed some back up, some support and in this case I knew my brother was the person I needed most. When Uncle Michael arrived on Thursday, our first stop was Target. You\u2019d think that for our mother\u2019s funeral we\u2019d hit a higher end store, maybe even Nordstrom. But we all felt too numb for Nordstrom \u2013 which is saying a lot. And, besides, Target was Nana\u2019s favorite store. C.J. led us to the \u201cgirls\u2019 section\u201d and started purposefully working the aisles and holding out fabrics he fancied. Uncle Michael and I did the same. The three of us called out to each other when a dress caught our eye and held it up for comments and opinions. Uncle Michael and I have similar tastes and found a few options that we thought were perfect. C.J. nixed them all. Uncle Michael looked at me shocked and flabbergasted that someone would argue with his good taste (and it is good, after all he helped me win \u201cBest Dressed\u201d in high school). C.J. decided on a cream linen dress with delicate eyelet detail, a dainty navy blue cardigan and a headband with blue and yellow flowers adorning it. He could not be swayed. \u201cThis has to be his decision, this is how he wants to send off Nana,\u201d I told my brother. \u201cBut, there are several better dresses\u2026\u201d he started. \u201cTrust me, I know.\u201d The next two days, C.J. kept reminding us that he was going to be a girl and wear a dress at Nana\u2019s Celebration of Life. We said we knew and thought it was perfect. If that\u2019s how he felt Nana would want him, then that\u2019s exactly what he should do. He never again asked about the strangers who we would welcome into our home and what their reactions to a boy in a dress might be. He was unwavering in his decision and he didn\u2019t care what other people thought. He was committed to making the event about him and his Nana. That made me proud. Because, that is what memorializing a person and the relationship you had with them is all about. \u201cPa, I\u2019m going to be a girl at Nana\u2019s Celebration of Life,\u201d he said to my dad the night before the service. He looked his grandfather right in the eyes and stood firm. If anybody in our family was going to have a reaction it would be Pa. I nervously held my breath. \u201cThat is exactly how Nana would want you and that\u2019s what you should do. It\u2019s about you and Nana and she loved you so much,\u201d Pa said as he wrapped C.J. in a hug. I teared up (because this death has turned me into a crier and) because it\u2019s the first time I\u2019d heard my father be that accepting and empowering of C.J. The day of the Celebration of Life, C.J. made sure I steamed his dress, like I did mine, and flat ironed his hair, like I did mine. He spritzed on some Chanel Coco perfume and applied his favorite lip gloss. After he put on his cream dress, navy cardi and flowered headband, I surprised him by presenting him with a strand of Nana\u2019s pearls to wear. He greeted people at the door as they arrived at our house for the Celebration of Life. We introduced him to people from my parents\u2019 church and to their friends who had never met him before. \u201cThis is our youngest son, C.J.,\u201d we\u2019d say. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you,\u201d they\u2019d say. \u201cYour Nana told us so much about you.\u201d That afternoon, my son was not one bit worried about what perfect strangers would think about him wearing a dress. He listened to those strangers tell him that his Nana loved him very much and that she told everyone all about him. He was unabashed and unashamed. He honored Nana and their special relationship beautifully. I imagined her looking down on him. \u201cThat\u2019s my beautiful boy! You look so pretty! I love your dress!\u201d she\u2019d say, like she always did.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
