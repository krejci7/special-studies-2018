We came up with nothing\u2026until we found each other.\u00a0 Every day we are grateful for the relationships that have developed between our families.\u00a0 We\u2019ve always been aware that we have it good and, now, we are giddy as hell to help other families connect. This blog post marks the official launch of Rainbows At Play.\u00a0 Rainbows At Play is an online community that connects families raising gender nonconforming kids so they can playdate and find fierceness in numbers.  Here\u2019s how to join:  You must be a primary caregiver of a differently gendered child. \u00a0(If you are not raising a child, please don\u2019t join the community.\u00a0 Help us keep Rainbows At Play kiddos and families safe by only joining if you are an adult primary caregiver.\u00a0 We will post updates to our blogs about Rainbows At Play that will allow others to join in on the joy and happiness of the community.\u00a0 You can also follow us on Twitter and Facebook for updates and fun peeks into the Rainbows At Play community.\u00a0 We hate to be exclusive, unwelcoming and uninviting.\u00a0 We hope you understand why we have to be when it comes to this very special project.) If you don\u2019t already have a Lefora.com membership, go there and create an account so that you can access communities, groups and forums hosted by Lefora. Go to Rainbows.Lefora.com and fill out the application. Be patient.\u00a0 Initially, Kelly and I will be reviewing all applications ourselves.\u00a0 We hope to have so many families apply that it takes us a few days to get to new applications.\u00a0 Wouldn\u2019t that be wonderful?\u00a0 The more who join, the better your odds of finding a local playdate mate and family just like yours. Once you are accepted into the community, read the \u201cRules and Guidelines\u201d and \u201cGetting Started\u201d topics found at the top of the Community\u2019s homepage. Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter. Spread the word and the sparkle.  This parenting journey can be lonely, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. \u00a0Let\u2019s get playing!
