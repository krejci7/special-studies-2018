We were driving through West Hollywood on our way to Uncle Michael\u2019s. Stopped at a red light on Santa Monica Boulevard, a very fit, shirtless, short-short-wearing, glistening, not-hard-to-look-at man jogged past our car. \u201cI see a gay guy,\u201d C.J. said and pointed. \u201cWhat?!\u201d Matt and I said, turning simultaneously to look at C.J. \u201cThat guy, right there, running, he\u2019s gay,\u201d C.J. pointed again, nonchalantly. \u201cOkay, well, you don\u2019t know if he\u2019s gay or not\u2026\u201d I said, even though, if I were a betting woman, I\u2019d put money on the runner being gay. \u201cHe\u2019s gay. I know it,\u201d C.J. said surely. \u201cIt\u2019s not nice to point and say that,\u201d I said. It wasn\u2019t my best use of a teachable moment, but we were almost to Shake Shack and I was hungry. A week or two later, C.J. and I were walking through the mall holding hands (I\u2019m already sad for the day when he stops reaching for me with his painted nails and rubber band bracelets). \u201cThat guy is gay,\u201d he said to me and pointed, like he was pointing out a cute top in the window of Forever 21. I stopped him and explained that:  It\u2019s not nice to point at people. It\u2019s not cool to assume something about someone you don\u2019t know. We see gay people \u2013 and straight people \u2014 all the time but we don\u2019t announce it. Someone else\u2019s sexuality is none of our business.  \u201cI know, but I don\u2019t know that gay person like I know all the other gay people. That\u2019s a new gay person,\u201d C.J. explained. C.J. knows and loves a lot of gay people; it seemed odd to him that he didn\u2019t know the man at the mall or the man running in WeHo. I told my brother that C.J. had pointed out a gay person again. Uncle Michael wasn\u2019t happy with this new habit. \u201cYou have to get him to stop doing that,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cMy whole life I felt like people were pointing out that I was gay. It\u2019s not cool.\u201d Days later, C.J. and I were watching a choir of high school students sing on America\u2019s Got Talent. \u201cI see a gay person,\u201d C.J. said again, forgetting the lesson I taught him at the mall. \u201cWhich one?\u201d I asked. It was a big group. C.J. paused the television, approached it, stood on his tippy toes and pointed to a boy in the middle of the very back row. \u201cYou have no idea if he\u2019s gay. You can barely see him,\u201d I argued. \u201cI was watching him. He\u2019s gay, trust me.\u201d \u201cWhat if someone pointed at you and said you were gay?\u201d \u201cI could work with that,\u201d he replied with a sassy nod of his head. \u201cHow do you feel when people point at you and say that you like girl stuff?\u201d I asked. \u201cI don\u2019t like that.\u201d I explained that when a stranger points at you and says something, sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell if they are being nice, mean or inquisitive. If you don\u2019t like it when people do it to you, don\u2019t do it to other people. But, this was in the privacy of our own home. The singing boy on America\u2019s Got Talent had no clue that my son thought he was gay. I texted my friend Jeff. \u201cCan you see gay people? Like is gaydar real?\u201d I wrote before explaining the situation to him. Jeff thinks C.J. is just looking for himself, for people who are like him. As a child, Jeff did the same thing \u2014 he just didn\u2019t announce it to his parents. Some of my brother\u2019s friends had the same reaction. That explanation seemed the most likely. C.J. points out gay people like he does fellow redheads. I absolutely want C.J. to know and feel that there are other people like him out there, that he\u2019s not an oddity. But, I also want him to have manners and be respectful. So, I explained that when he sees someone whom he thinks is gay, he can always tell me privately, but it\u2019s not okay to point and say it publicly. (As you can tell, I have none of the parenting answers; I just make things up as I go along.) The third time was the charm. C.J.\u2019s much more discreet about seeing gay people and I remind him that it\u2019s not cool to assume something about someone you don\u2019t know. \u201cI see gay people,\u201d he\u2019ll whisper to me with a smile. It\u2019s like a way-less creepy version of the kid in The Sixth Sense who saw dead people. I look around and sometimes I see gay people too and sometimes I don\u2019t. Sometimes only C.J. can. Question: If you are gay or lesbian, can you instinctively identify gay and lesbian people? Does gaydar really exist? How would you handle this parenting situation?
