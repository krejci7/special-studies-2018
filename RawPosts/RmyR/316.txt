What is Feast of Fun?\u00a0  A daily podcast talk show hosted by Fausto Fern\u00f3s\u00a0and Marc Felion\u00a0featuring celebrity guests and friends of the LGBT\u00a0community.

It\u2019s one of the most popular daily audio programs of its kind for any audience.  Here\u2019s a brief description of what we talked about on the show: \u201cPink boys, princess boys, rainbow kids and the little guy who wanted to dress up as Daphne from Scooby\u00a0Doo: there is an explosion of moms coming forward to say it\u2019s OK to let your kids play with the toys they want or even make believe and dress up like a fairy princess. These moms don\u2019t care if their kids are gay, transgendered or just going through a phase, they just want them to grow up in a loving accepting society. So they are blogging about it, and want your support. Today we\u2019re talking to C.J.\u2019s mom who writes the blog, Raising my Rainbow\u00a0where she anonymously shares her story about raising her 4 year old\u00a0son C.J. who love princesses, Barbie dolls, Alice in Wonderland and pretending he\u2019s celebrity home style cook Paula Deen. Listen as C.J.\u2019s mom shares with us the messages she\u2019s gotten from thousands of people from all around the world for being a mom who supports her kids to be whoever they want to be.\u201d Listen to the podcast here: http://www.feastoffun.com/podcast/2011/02/24/fof-1334-i-think-my-4-year-old-son-is-gay-02-24-11/ Thanks to Fausto, Marc, Feast of Fun and their listeners for the love and support.
