 A life-size stuffed animal giraffe (Yes, he still wants this. No, he’s not getting it.) The American Girl Doll Bitty Baby with red hair and green eyes to match his (He might be getting this.) A full size, real life arcade claw machine filled with prizes (He says he’s checked around and it’s only $150 installed. I do not believe him. I do not know who he checked with.) A crop top (We’ve explained countless times that crop tops are allowed if worn over a long layering tank. He is not thrilled with layering in this instance.) Jeggings with lots of rips in them (I couldn’t find his size all ripped up. He’ll have to settle for a deconstructed wash.) Gogo boots (Because of course.) Ballet flats with sparkles and jewels. NOT BORING ONES! (I hope the ones I got are FLASHY enough for him.) 30th Anniversary Strawberry Shortcake (“I like everything ‘old school’.” – C.J.) A remote control car that his Monster High dolls can ride in (I hope the Monster High kids will ride in a Bratz make and model because that’s all I could find that fit the bill.) A hover board (No.) Magnetic earrings (Yes.) A real or toy white-on-white Range Rover (No.) Shopkins (Yes.) A porcupine (No.) The latest iPhone in rose gold (No.) A trip to Hawaii (No.)   Whatever you wished for this holiday season, I hope you get it. If the holidays aren’t a happy time for you, hang in there. Let’s all meet up again in 2016! xoxo, Lori
