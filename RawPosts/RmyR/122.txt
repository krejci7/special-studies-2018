We sincerely regret that the issue of being told to leave the bookbag at home was perceived as blaming Grayson. While that was not the intent, the perception became reality. We support Grayson bringing the bookbag to school. We discussed a number of options to consider in moving forward for Grayson. All of the options discussed included a safety transition plan and an allowance for Grayson to bring the bookbag to school. Every situation with young children is a teachable moment and we will use this example in our efforts to address a wider issue of bullying. The Bruce family has committed to working with us to improve and enhance our anti-bullying programs. We ask for everyone\u2019s patience and understanding as we continue to work collaboratively with the family toward a resolution that is best for Grayson and his classmates at Candler Elementary School. * * * A few months ago, I was introduced to the videos of Laurin Mayeno.\u00a0 Laurin is the mother of a 25-year-old out, proud gay man who was gender creative as a child.\u00a0 She has created three Proud Mom Videos in which she shares her experiences parenting her son, Danny.\u00a0 She created the series with her son\u2019s help to open hearts and minds, spark dialogue, build awareness and support families like her own. You should watch them and then poke around her Out Proud Families website:\u00a0 http://www.outproudfamilies.com/?page_id=25 * * * GLSEN, The Matthew Shepard Foundation, Candlewick Press and author Leslea Newman have put together an expanded resource guide for Newman\u2019s book, OCTOBER MOURNING: A SONG FOR MATTHEW SHEPARD.\u00a0 The resource guide tells the story of Matthew Shepard, teaches themes of empathy and justice, implements LGBT-inclusive lesson plans, meets reading and writing standards and supports LGBT students. Check it out here: http://glsen.org/matthewshepard * * * I\u2019ve been contacted by a director who is casting for a workshop of a play in which all actors are trans.\u00a0 They are looking for someone who can play a 17 year old trans girl. Here\u2019s more info: \u201cMERISM\u201d Your Name Here: A Queer Theater Company Workshop Production Producer: \u00a0{Your Name Here}: A Queer Theater Company \u00a0\u00a0http://www.yournamehereqtc.org/ SUMMARY:\u00a0Nina\u2019s a 4.0 high school senior from a privileged family but when her mom won\u2019t get out of bed she goes looking for parenting and support at a queer and trans youth drop-in center. \u00a0\u00a0She quickly bonds with Bo, the only other transperson she sees and, as they become friends, urges him to come stay with her and her mom. \u00a0MERISM tells the story of three transpeople whose lives become inextricably connected. Actors can be any ethnicity, but must identify as trans or gender-queer.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter where they are in their transition, as long as they identify as female.\u00a0 The workshop takes place in New York City, so they need someone who lives in the tri-state area.\u00a0 Actors will be paid.
