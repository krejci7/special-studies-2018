Back in the days when I picked out C.J.\u2019s costumes and gender wasn\u2019t an issue. The Halloween before last, our three and a half year old son wanted to dress up as Snow White and we were panic-stricken. What would people say?\u00a0 How would people respond?\u00a0 Though we were tempted to, we would not let our boy dress as a girl for all to see \u2013 not even on the one night of the year that is reserved for fantasy, role-play and costumes.\u00a0 Oh, no, instead I sat him on my lap, scrolled through BuyCostumes.com\u2019s \u201cBoys Costumes\u201d section and manipulated him into thinking that those were his only options. He finally, reluctantly selected a costume.\u00a0 He slid off of my lap and walked solemnly to his room as I ordered it online.\u00a0 I felt bad for not letting him dress as he wanted for Halloween, but I also felt like I didn\u2019t have another choice.\u00a0 What kind of parent let\u2019s their child cross-dress in public? Besides, I argued, C.J. was getting what he really wanted out of a costume, which was to wear makeup and fabric that \u201cfelt nice.\u201d He trick-or-treated as a silly-faced skeleton, wearing a black satiny polyester blend getup with a face full of black and white make-up that would have impressed the girls and boys working the MAC counter. It was fine, but it was not Snow White. Halloween was over and I figured that our boy\u2019s \u201cgirly phase\u201d would be done by the next October 31, at which time he\u2019d pick a \u201cboy costume\u201d and we would forget about the Snow-White-Skeleton Halloween. Twelve months later, C.J. was four and a half and wanted to dress up as Frankie Stein, (the teenaged daughter of Frankenstein and star pupil at Monster High) for Halloween. By that time we had realized that our son\u2019s penchant for all things girly was not a phase, it was his way of life.\u00a0 We knew that he was gender nonconforming.\u00a0\u00a0 We knew that he was going to want a \u201cgirl costume\u201d for Halloween.\u00a0 We weren\u2019t panic-stricken like the year before, but we were scared. If he were an only child, he could get all dolled up in full drag and rock the hell out of All Hallows\u2019 Eve. \u00a0But, he wasn\u2019t an only child. And, while C.J. might not get teased if he wore a \u201cgirl\u2019s costume,\u201d his older brother probably would. We were committed to letting C.J. wear the costume of his choice, as we worried incessantly about the effects it might have on his brother. Our one condition was that C.J. had to wear a wig.\u00a0 His dad and I both felt like we could really hide (protect) him and his brother with the use of a wig. A wig felt like a safety net.\u00a0 I took C.J. shopping for his costume early in the morning in the middle of the week so that no one would see his selection. C.J.\u2019s Brother was less-than-thrilled about his little brother dressing like a girl and parading himself proudly around our community for Halloween.\u00a0 For all of us but C.J., the holiday\u2019s happiness was damped by worry. C.J.\u2019s costume is not this slutty. Swear. This year for Halloween, C.J. wanted to dress up as Bloom, a fairy from Winx Club.\u00a0 None of us gave it a second thought; we just bought the costume.\u00a0 No manipulative online browsing.\u00a0 No off-hour trip to the costume store.\u00a0 No panic.\u00a0 No worry.\u00a0 No nothing. The costume didn\u2019t come with a wig and I didn\u2019t get one.\u00a0 Bloom has red hair and so does C.J.\u00a0 His isn\u2019t long like hers but I figured that we didn\u2019t need a wig.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t feel like we needed the protection that a wig felt like it provided last year. C.J. freaked out. \u201cI need a wig!\u00a0\u00a0 I want a wig!\u00a0 If I don\u2019t have a wig people will know I\u2019m a boy.\u00a0 They\u2019ll know it\u2019s me!\u201d he said mid-meltdown. \u201cOkay, okay, we\u2019ll get a wig.\u00a0 I promise,\u201d I said. \u201cToday?\u201d \u201cNo, but before Halloween.\u201d His dad, brother and I hadn\u2019t given this year\u2019s costume choice a second thought.\u00a0 And, just as we three got to the point of not caring about what other people might say or think or do, C.J. was just beginning to care, take such things into consideration and modify his behavior accordingly. Now it saddens me to think that next year he might want a \u201cboy costume\u201d to avoid negativity, stares and judgment from other people.\u00a0 Now, I don\u2019t want my boy to want a boy costume.
