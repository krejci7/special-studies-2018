We\u2019ve found two families locally that we\u2019ve gotten to know since summer. One of our gender nonconforming friends is a sweet little boy named C.K., who I\u2019ve written about before. C.K. is five and wanted to be Minnie Mouse for Halloween. But, he was afraid that people would make fun of him, so he selected a Spiderman costume instead. Then, he was bummed that he didn\u2019t get to be Minnie Mouse. Well, he can be Minnie Mouse at our house! So, C.J. and I hosted our first annual gender nonconforming Halloween costume party. C.K. came dressed as Minnie Mouse and he brought his mom, dad and brother who was a ninja. Our other friend T.L. came. He will be trick-or-treating as Cleopatra on Halloween, but came to our party as a black cat. He brought his mom. C.J. got all decked out in his pink fairy costume and C.J.\u2019s Brother wore his grim reaper costume. I donned the fascinator\u00a0that I wore when I called in sick to work and watched Will and Kate get married. Nana Grab Bags showed up dressed as a sassy witch. From left: T.L., C.J. and C.K. These boys are going to change the world. We decorated our nails. C.K. painted his own left hand, his mom helped him with his right hand.   We decorated pumpkins.   We decorated cookies. C.J.\u2019s cookie decorating skills know no bounds. T.L. enjoying his cookie while wearing one of my old wigs. Everybody got a goody bag. C.J. and his goody bag. And we had the best Halloween party ever. Boo!   ", "feedtitle": "Page 22 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
