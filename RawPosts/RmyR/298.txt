Look what C.J. made at school! Ms. Sunshine is a Raising My Rainbow fan. Coincidence? I think not. The best line from C.J.\u2019s six-page evaluation? \u201cC.J. stands up for his rights.\u201d\u00a0 We are convinced that is Ms. Sunshine\u2019s nice way of saying that C.J. is a total diva at school, just as he is at home. When I called her on it, she smiled and said that C.J. is an angel.\u00a0 Apparently, sometimes, Ms. Sunshine lies. The best quote from the meeting?\u00a0 One of the preschool pros said, \u201cI just want to follow C.J. and know if he turns out to be a hairdresser when he grows up.\u00a0 Because, every time I need his full attention and cooperation I bribe with the promise of getting to brush the hair of a princess doll that I have in class.\u201d I\u2019m glad that my son stands up for his rights; he\u2019ll need that tenacity in life.\u00a0 I\u2019m also glad he has a thing for hair; because if he does turn out to be a hairdresser, this mama is gonna save a lot of money on highlights and lowlights.
