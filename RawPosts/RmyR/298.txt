 I heart C.J.’s preschool teacher, Ms. Sunshine.  She understands C.J., celebrates him, supports him and thinks he’s pretty fabulous.  As C.J. approaches the end of his first full year in preschool, Ms. Sunshine scheduled the obligatory parent-teacher conference to discuss C.J.’s progress and educational future.  In attendance?  Ms. Sunshine, two other preschool professionals, C.J.’s Dad and me. Look what C.J. made at school! Ms. Sunshine is a Raising My Rainbow fan. Coincidence? I think not. The best line from C.J.’s six-page evaluation? “C.J. stands up for his rights.”  We are convinced that is Ms. Sunshine’s nice way of saying that C.J. is a total diva at school, just as he is at home. When I called her on it, she smiled and said that C.J. is an angel.  Apparently, sometimes, Ms. Sunshine lies. The best quote from the meeting?  One of the preschool pros said, “I just want to follow C.J. and know if he turns out to be a hairdresser when he grows up.  Because, every time I need his full attention and cooperation I bribe with the promise of getting to brush the hair of a princess doll that I have in class.” I’m glad that my son stands up for his rights; he’ll need that tenacity in life.  I’m also glad he has a thing for hair; because if he does turn out to be a hairdresser, this mama is gonna save a lot of money on highlights and lowlights.
