I realized that C.J. was now sitting up in bed watching us argue.\u00a0 We rarely argue in front of him and his brother, but here we were doing it\u2026.about the proper representation of a princess as it relates to our five-year-old son\u2019s future aspirations. \u00a0Moments like these don\u2019t happen in other houses with only sons, do they? C.J.\u2019s Dad was standing his non-princess ground. \u201cC.J., there are princesses in real life, but they aren\u2019t like the Disney Princesses or Princess Peach or the other princesses that you know,\u201d I explained.\u00a0 \u201cHere, let\u2019s go look on the computer.\u201d How did parents explain anything to their kids before the Internet? I showed him a picture of Princess/Duchess Kate Middleton from around the time of her engagement. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty, but she\u2019s not a princess,\u201d he said wrinkling up his nose.\u00a0 I got lost in her perfect hair.\u00a0 How can a person have consistently perfect hair?\u00a0 I had perfect hair once recently.\u00a0 While out the other night I ran into Willam Belli.\u00a0 Yes, THE Willam Belli from RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.\u00a0 He told me my blow out was great.\u00a0 When one of the most famous drag queens in America tells you that you have a \u201cgreat\u201d blowout, you don\u2019t wash your hair for three days.\u00a0 This I know. I found a picture of Princess Kate on her wedding day. \u201cThere she is dressed fancy, with her prince,\u201d I said. \u201cDat\u2019s better,\u201d C.J. said, shaking his head in approval. \u201cBut we live in the United States and in the United States we don\u2019t have kings and queens and princes and princesses.\u00a0 We have presidents,\u201d I explained. I pulled up a photo of President Obama and showed it to C.J.\u00a0 He looked at the photo on the screen and whipped his head back to look at me with a face that said \u201cyou\u2019ve got to be kidding me, that\u2019s so boring compared to a monarchy.\u201d \u201cHow far away are the real princesses?\u201d \u201cFar.\u201d \u201cFarther than tornadoes?\u201d\u00a0 (He\u2019s scared to death of tornadoes, but feels better knowing that they occur far away from where we live in California.) \u201cYes, princesses are much farther away than tornadoes.\u201d \u201cDat\u2019s far,\u201d he said looking longingly at the photo of Will and Kate on their wedding day. I turned off the computer and put my clean boy to bed in my moderately clean house, which would be much cleaner in 24 hours. I put myself to bed and thought about questions that I\u2019m asked quite often. If I had a little girl, would I allow her to play with princess toys, read princess stories and watch princess movies?\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Would I want her to aspire to be a princess?\u00a0 It depends on your definition of a princess.\u00a0 A princess who is helpless without the aid of a man, who has no ambitions of her own and whose most important journey in life is finding true love?\u00a0 No.\u00a0 A princess who is an educated do-gooder who is treated kindly and as an equal by her partner who stands up for the causes dear to her heart and who has a killer blowout?\u00a0 Sure. Am I treating my fictitious daughter and my gender nonconforming son differently?\u00a0 If so, is that okay?\u00a0 Would I treat my child\u2019s fantasies differently based on their gender?\u00a0 It\u2019s something I pondered as I drifted away to dreamland.
