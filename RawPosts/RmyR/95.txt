All Posts For Goodness Sex Gay Giveaway LGBTQ parenting winners 
 On Friday, I announced that I was giving away a copy of Al Vernacchio’s book For Goodness Sex to one lucky winner.  To enter to win, you had to leave a comment letting me know what you are thankful for this Thanksgiving season. The comments were so heartwarming that the book’s publisher contacted me and gave me another copy of the book to giveaway. So, the two winners are: Dan Woog and fit40sblog If you’re a winner, email me at raisingmyrainbow@gmail.com with your name and mailing address.  Congrats! What am I thankful for? The supportive, loving, caring, inspiring, smart, hilarious people in my life: Matt, C.J., Chase, our village and all of you. I’m a lucky, lucky girl.
