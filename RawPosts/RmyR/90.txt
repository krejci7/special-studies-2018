Luckily, Katy Perry\u2019s halftime show made the day bearable for him. Because of the NFL\u2019s total disregard for my child\u2019s birthday, we were forced to celebrate early. On Friday, I picked up C.J. and three of his best girl friends after school for a birthday playdate at our house. The night before, while C.J. was asleep, I decorated the house in the pink and black party supplies he had selected. I was giving myself an \u201cA\u201d grade in parenting. Then, we arrived home and Matt was waiting with a bouquet of pink and white flowers for C.J., which knocked me down to a \u201cB\u201d grade and moved him up to an \u201cA+\u201d grade because a dad surprising his son with a birthday bouquet of flowers will always earn 100 percent.  At C.J.\u2019s request, we gathered around the dining room table and decorated cookies. As you can see, to this group, more is more.  Then, we made Valentine\u2019s Day-themed monkey necklaces. The package showed a girl monkey and a boy monkey, but we called them red monkeys and black monkeys. I told C.J. and his girl friends that we had enough supplies for each of them to make one red monkey necklace and one black monkey necklace. They all made the red monkey first and decorated it to be a girl monkey. \u201cI\u2019m going to make the black monkey be a half boy, half girl monkey,\u201d C.J. informed everyone at the table. \u201cMe too! The boy monkey will be half boy and half girl like you, C.J.!\u201d one of his friends said. All the others excitedly followed suit and C.J. was beyond flattered.  The cookie decorating and necklace making didn\u2019t take nearly as long as I had anticipated; I was scrambling to think of something for them to do. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go upstairs and play what we always play during lunch and recess,\u201d C.J. proclaimed. \u201cWhat do you play?\u201d \u201cAnnie.\u201d And, with that, they were off, clamoring up the stairs and slamming doors as they all selected articles of clothing from our enormous dress up bin and dispersed to various rooms to get suited up. C.J. put on a dress, which I wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d feel comfortable doing because one of the girls had never been to our house before nor seen him in a dress or skirt. When they reconvened in C.J.\u2019s room they took their places (naturally, C.J. got to be Annie since he was the birthday boy) and, then, at the top of their lungs, started singing \u201cIt\u2019s A Hard-Knock Life.\u201d Over and over and over and over again. They even had a semi-choreographed dance routine. I wondered what the other kids on the playground thought about them when they did this at school. After close to an hour of enjoying their vocals, I suggested it was time to open presents. On the way downstairs C.J. and his friends tried to convince me that the new Annie movie is better than the original Annie movie. In an attempt to be a gracious host, I said that we should agree to disagree. Proving they know him well, his friends gifted him with My Little Pony, Monster High, Littlest Pet Shop and a Target gift card, which he later spent on Shopkins and leggings.  When, it was time to take his friends home. C.J. left his dress on and slipped on flip-flops. \u201cIs C.J. going to take me home wearing a dress?!\u201d his newer friend asked. \u201cYup.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked. She shrugged her shoulders and giggled and took his hand as they walked to the car. We went to bed early that night, because the next day was a very big day\u2026.
