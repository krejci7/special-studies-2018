I got in a fight with Mia,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat kind of fight?\u00a0 Why?\u201d \u201cI told her that I got to stay up late to watch the Tony\u2019s that you recorded and she said that Neil Patrick Harris is not a real person, that he is fake and not a real human being,\u201d C.J. explained. \u201cAnd, what did you say to that?\u201d \u201cI told her that yeah huh he is.\u00a0 But then she kept saying it.\u00a0 She said it ELEVEN times!\u201d he said both irritated and dumbfounded. \u201cWell, she\u2019s wrong.\u00a0 He is a real person,\u201d I said. \u201cI know, I tried telling her but she wouldn\u2019t listen.\u00a0 I told her to watch the Tony\u2019s tonight like I\u2019m going to.\u201d \u201cAnd, what did she say to that?\u201d \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know about that show.\u00a0 None of my friends know about the Tony show.\u00a0 But, everyone else believed me that Neil Patrick Harris is too a real person,\u201d he explained. C.J. has been watching the Tony\u2019s in 30-minute increments since they aired.\u00a0 He is obsessed.\u00a0 Now, he can\u2019t decide which awards show he wants to go to next year: The Tony Show (Tony Awards) or The Night When Everybody Dresses Fancy (Academy Awards).\u00a0 Lucky for him he has several months to make up his mind and figure out a way to score an invite to one or the other. * * * Thanks to all of you for the awesome suggestions of things to do while in New York City. \u00a0Thanks to you, we\u2019ve walked the High Line and visited Chelsea Market \u2014 where we ate a grilled cheese sandwich, drank a hot chocolate and had a People\u2019s Pop. \u00a0Tomorrow we have a tour of the Tenement Museum. \u00a0You guys are the best!
