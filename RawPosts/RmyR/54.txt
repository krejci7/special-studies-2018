A spritz of perfume here. A few coats of nail polish there. Suddenly his makeup bag grew from a old small one I used to carry in my purse to a hard pink box the size of a briefcase with vanity lights inside. He applied his makeup to himself. Then his Barbies. Then the mannequin head my mother-in-law bought him for Christmas. That head is, more often than not, eerily affixed to our kitchen island; staring at me as I watch TV long after C.J. has gone to bed and the night has grown dark. \u201cYou scared the shit out of me!\u201d I say to it often while catching my breath.  Once C.J. started doing my makeup, he begged to do it every night. With little regard for my skin\u2019s rebellion. My adult acne is due in large part to my son\u2019s heavy application of makeup night after night. When we were young, my brother and I did our mom\u2019s makeup and always aimed for a natural look. You know, lipstick on the lips, eyeliner on the lids, mascara on the lashes. I quickly learned that C.J. doesn\u2019t care for a natural look. The first time C.J. did my makeup, he turned me into a zombie. Then I was a \u201cCandy Girl\u201d inspired by Katy Perry. With heart-shaped blush and candy swirls rising from my eyes. Then, I was the girl from the Starbucks logo. When I saw myself in the mirror the only thought I had was \u201cplease, please, please let all of this come off for work tomorrow.\u201d A future fine artist who also does makeup to support himself, C.J. still does his own makeup from time to time. Here he gave himself a \u201cBig Eyes\u201d look based on the art of Margaret D. H. Keane. Naturally, a new favorite pastime of C.J.\u2019s is watching makeup tutorials on YouTube. Who do you recommend? I\u2019m not the only one in the family who gets their makeup done by C.J. Click here to read about him doing Matt\u2019s makeup.
