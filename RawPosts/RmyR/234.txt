That Video Boy\u2019s parents think that they are raising their child right.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure they were proud of their sweater-vested tike as he sang a church solo up on stage.\u00a0 My guess is that they were beaming with pride as out of his mouth tumbled words of hate, judgment and homophobia. Whatever happened to \u201cJesus loves the little children, all the children of the world?\u201d The viral video was off of my screen, but not out of my mind.\u00a0 I got up from my desk and indulged myself in a simple pleasure of the working mom: a walk to the overpriced, underwhelming deli in the lobby of the next office building to grab a sandwich to eat as I worked through lunch. \u201cI think that Video Boy\u2019s parents are doing a shitty job of parenting,\u201d I thought to myself.\u00a0 Then, I realized that they\u2019d think the exact same thing of our parenting of both of our sons\u2026especially C.J. To me, they are bad parents.\u00a0 To them I am we are bad parents.\u00a0 They are raising an LGBTQ hater and I\u2019m raising an LGBTQ lover.\u00a0 Tit for tat.\u00a0 Agree to disagree.\u00a0 One step forward, one step back.\u00a0 I wonder\u2026in this great big world\u2026do our families cancel each other out? I thought of something that I posted on my Facebook page recently.\u00a0 It\u2019s a quote that says \u201cNo child is born homophobic.\u201d\u00a0 True that.\u00a0 No child is born full of hate.\u00a0 Video Boy\u2019s parents are making him homophobic.\u00a0 They are feeding him hate for breakfast, especially on Sundays. The equivalent in our family would be to pump ecclesiaphobia into our children; to instill in them a fear of church, organized religion or holy people.\u00a0 I refuse to do it.\u00a0 In our house hate will not breed hate and fear will not breed fear.\u00a0 Sometimes it\u2019s a daily struggle that goes against every urge in my sassy soul. As I ate my chicken salad sandwich, I thought more about Video Boy and his family.\u00a0 I read some of the comments about the video that people had left on my Facebook page and other comments found online.\u00a0 Some people believe that it all docmented a form of child abuse. Do I think it\u2019s abuse?\u00a0 No.\u00a0 I do think that kids shouldn\u2019t be forced or persuaded to make big statements about big topics that they can\u2019t possibly understand, let alone develop an opinion on. How much of our agenda can we push on our kids? I\u2019ve been accused of abusing C.J. because I let him slide all over the gender spectrum\u2026.and I (gasp) write about it!\u00a0 But, I have never so much as encouraged either of my sons to take a stand, make a statement or advocate for my position on anything, unless they can understand it and can determine how they (not me) feel about it. I do insist of my childen \u2013 as I do of the people who matter in our lives \u2013 that they have an open heart and an open mind.\u00a0 Poor Video Boy is all closed up already.\u00a0 Locked in his body with fear and hate.\u00a0 God was not smiling down on Video Boy\u2019s homophobia\u2026his parents, the parishoners and the pastor are fools for thinking differently.
