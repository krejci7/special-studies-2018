People can have kids lots of different ways. When you make a baby from scratch you need a man and a woman,\u201d I answered. \u201cOh, cause I was wondering, cause Mitch and Cam don\u2019t look Chinese.\u201d \u201cOn the show, Lily\u2019s character isn\u2019t from China, she\u2019s from Vietnam, those are two totally different places,\u201d I said. (Geography teacher + sex-ed teacher = me.) C.J.\u2019s brother has been curious about sex and babies lately. Not only have we been peppered with questions about \u201cthe birds and the bees,\u201d but also about \u201cthe birds and the birds\u201d and \u201cthe bees and the bees.\u201d \u201cPlease just tell me how babies get out of your belly,\u201d he said seriously, tired of the game playing. \u201cAnd, DON\u2019T tell me they get out through the belly button!\u201d \u201cThe doctor or nurse or midwife helps the baby out,\u201d I said, as I\u2019ve been saying for a while now. \u201cBut, WHERE do they help it come out of?\u201d \u201cThe vagina.\u201d \u201cWHAT?!?!?! Gross! I thought it came out of the upper-leg area,\u201d he said making a sour-face and smile at the same time. Ahhhh, to be innocent and think that babies escape the uterus via the thigh. For as long as he can remember C.J.\u2019s Brother has known that families come in all shapes sizes and gender/sex makeups. But, now that he is thinking about logistics, families that he\u2019s known forever are sparking questions. Take our Facebook friends who are two dads with an adopted daughter named after two famous Hepburns, where\u2019d she come from? She was adopted. Okay. Families through birth? Check. Families through adoption? Check. Families through surrogacy and egg/sperm donation? No check. On Sunday night, Oprah\u2019s Next Chapter featured an hour-long interview with Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka. They were talking about \u201cthe new nuclear family.\u201d My hubby and I watched that night and sat down with C.J.\u2019s Brother to watch it the next day to show him a family that is different than our own. \u201cI know them! That\u2019s Neil and David!\u201d he said with a gigantic smile when their images popped onto the scream. C.J.\u2019s Brother attended the world premier of The Muppets movie as the guest of Uncle Uncle who was the guest of Neil and David. It was a defining day in C.J.\u2019s Brother\u2019s life. He went to Hollywood, he had the pleasure of seeing a \u201chobo\u201d (as he likes to call the housing-challenged), he walked the green carpet, he met THE Muppets, he got to see a movie before any of his friends could have possibly seen it and the day ended with an all-dessert after-party. Oprah showed a clip from Neil\u2019s days on Doogie Howser, M.D. \u201cLook, that\u2019s Neil when he was first on t.v.,\u201d I said. \u201cWow, that must have been in the sixties\u2026.like when they had the first 90210,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that old. I watched it when I was in junior high.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s old.\u201d Whatever. Neil and David gave Oprah a tour of their house. C.J.\u2019s Brother asked if we could get a magic room with a secret door like Neil Patrick Harris has. I told him he could get one in his house when he grows up. He was disappointed. I disappoint my children at least once a day. Today it was due to magic room envy. Then Neil and David\u2019s twins, Harper and Gideon, appeared. \u201cAhhhhh, they\u2019re so cute!\u201d C.J.\u2019s Brother said, quickly getting over our lack of a magic room. \u201cAre they adopted?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I answered. \u201cOne of them was pregnant?!\u201d he said pointing to Neil and David. \u201cNo, a lady helped them have their babies,\u201d I explained. \u201cThat was really nice of that lady,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Brother said. \u201cIt sure was,\u201d I replied honestly. C.J.\u2019s Brother lost interest in the show once the twins were whisked away for lunch and nap-time. I watched a few parts of the sit-down interview again, cause I liked them so much. First, I liked to watch Neil and David give Oprah an \u201caha\u201d moment. Viewers watched as Oprah realized, thanks to Neil and David\u2019s family, that same-sex couples have to really plan out having children. There are no accidental pregnancies with same-sex couples; their children are totally thought out, yearned for, planned for and accepted so gratefully with endless amounts of love. Same-sex couple pregnancies are never unwanted, no mistakes, no surprises. How many people can say that they have given Oprah Winfrey an aha moment? http://www.oprah.com/common/omplayer_embed.html?article_id=37875 \u201cWhat is your dream for your family?\u201d Oprah asked them. \u201cI hope that we find ourselves in positions where they have the freedom to embrace whatever it is that they\u2019re drawn to. I want to provide for them the opportunity for them to do whatever it is that they want,\u201d Neil answered. \u201cBe their own person.\u201d David added. \u201cBecause a lot of the time, we grow up thinking we should be something else. It\u2019s so important that we tell these kids that they\u2019re their own individual.\u201d The new nuclear family, has the same dream for their family that this mom has for her old traditional family. We didn\u2019t come to be families in the same way, but we want the same things. And, to me, that\u2019s all that matters. Thank you, thank you, thank you to Neil and David for being great people and parents\u2026and, for being brave examples for my sons.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 24 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
