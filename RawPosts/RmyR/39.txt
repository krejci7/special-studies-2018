It was stressful and exhausting. And, so, so worth it. Shortly after I wrote about C.J. dressing up as Bob The Drag Queen for Halloween, Bob contacted me. I just about died. I couldn\u2019t wait to tell C.J. that his hero wanted to talk to me. But, Bob told me not to tell C.J. because \u2013 wait for it \u2013 he wanted to try to surprise C.J. by showing up to trick or treat with him on Halloween night. The only thing Bob asked was that he get to see the look of surprise on C.J.\u2019s face. We couldn\u2019t tell C.J. I\u2019m a realist. What were the chances that Bob would actually fly into town for Halloween? Especially after a huge appearance and video launch that raged until 3 a.m. the morning of. In New York. No way it would work out, but the offer was beyond sweet. I decided that when meeting C.J. in person fell through, I\u2019d get up the nerve to ask Bob to send C.J. a video wishing him a happy Halloween. What\u2019s the worst that could happen? I\u2019d never have to find out, because the worst didn\u2019t happened. The best happened. Bob worked until the early morning on Halloween, hopped on a flight from NYC to LAX and here\u2019s what happened before and after the surprise of a lifetime. Watching the season eight finale of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race to get Halloween ready. 1 p.m. = Our family left Orange County for Uncle Michael\u2019s house in West Hollywood. C.J. loves West Hollywood and was very excited to spend Halloween with Uncle Michael and his friends. But, he was a little worried about the quality of trick or treating the neighborhood would offer given that he doesn\u2019t often see kids in WeHo. Matt, Chase and I were all nervous about the surprise and C.J. was in the dark. 2 p.m. = We arrived at Uncle Michael\u2019s in record time. As soon as we were up in Uncle Michael\u2019s apartment, Uncle Michael and Matt said they had to run to the store for something, but really they were meeting with a producer and cameraman from ABC\u2019s Nightline who were there to capture the surprise. 3 p.m. = While Uncle Michael did C.J.\u2019s makeup while I snuck downstairs to be interviewed by Nightline. View their coverage here. 4:20 p.m. = I got a text that Bob had arrived and was walking up the apartment. I was a nervous wreck. C.J. had no idea that he was about to meet his hero. How would he react? 4:30 p.m. = Bob knocked on the door and C.J. answered. C.J. stared and stared and stared. I was afraid he might pass out and fall over backward. Instead he ran to give Bob a hug. Then he started crying happy tears. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time I ever cried because I was happy,\u201d he said later. Bob and C.J. exchanged gifts. Bob gave C.J. two t-shirts, a coin purse and a custom made Bob The Drag Queen Doll. They are C.J.\u2019s most prized possessions.  C.J. gave Bob a painting he made that morning and a letter. C.J. thought that we were going to mail the painting and letter to Bob this week, as soon as I found his address (wink, wink).  5 p.m. = C.J. and Bob sat down for some lemonade and pizza. They started gabbing and C.J. got comfortable and attempted to make Bob his new best friend. 5:30 p.m. = Bob touched up C.J.\u2019s makeup and fixed his wig, teaching C.J. every step of the way. C.J. was a quiet and attentive student. He had lots of questions about fake eyelashes and made several attempts to touch Bob\u2019s without Bob noticing.    \u201cIf there\u2019s a gay heaven, Bob\u2019s going there for sure,\u201d Uncle Michael said. We all agreed. 5:45 p.m. = We headed downstairs to go trick or treating and stopped in the lobby for pictures. \u201cShit! My nail broke!\u201d C.J. exclaimed when one of his tiny press-on nails popped off. We all laughed. He\u2019s not usually allowed to say \u201cshit\u201d but I let it slide because it was Halloween and he was with his hero. And, because it made Bob laugh.  \u201cCan I hold your hand?\u201d C.J. asked Bob. \u201cOf course you can, gurl,\u201d Bob said reaching for C.J.\u2019s hand. 6 p.m. = We followed Bob and C.J. as they trick or treated. Bob hadn\u2019t trick or treated in years, but I guess it\u2019s like riding a bike because he knew exactly what to do. The two of them held hands and giggled from door to door. They shared trick or treat bag and purse holding duties. Imagine opening the door to find Bob The Drag Queen and a little Bob The Drag Queen asking for candy. \u201cOh, you look great,\u201d one old lady told Bob, thinking he was in a Halloween costume. \u201cI like your costumes,\u201d one man said. \u201cThanks! We are each other!\u201d Bob said. At one point, one lady was so nice to them that she invited them in to her house for more candy. I had to kick into mom mode and remind Bob and C.J. that for safety purposes we don\u2019t go in to strangers houses, especially on Halloween. Bob let C.J. have all the candy they collected, which C.J. thought was really cool. (Except the taffy. Bob loves taffy.)  \u00a0 7 p.m. = It was time to say goodbye to Bob. \u201cCan we have a playdate sometime?\u201d C.J. asked Bob. \u201cYes, of course,\u201d Bob said without hesitation. \u201cMy mom will text you,\u201d C.J. promised. Matt walked Bob to the Uber and told him again how much it meant to us that he rearranged his schedule to make it the most memorable Halloween our son will ever have. \u201cThat Uber driver is the luckiest Uber driver ever,\u201d C.J. said as Bob climbed into the car. We walked around the West Hollywood Carnaval for an hour and then drove home. \u201cIf Bob\u2019s going to gay heaven, I want to go there, too,\u201d C.J. said when I kissed him goodnight. \u201cMe too,\u201d I said. Both boys were late to school this morning. \u201cI\u2019m just going to tell the office and my teacher that I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late but I have a fun-hangover from being in West Hollywood all night with drag queens,\u201d C.J. said as we pulled into the parking lot. He still had eyeliner and mascara smudged around his eyes. When he got home from school he asked me to tell him again how everybody kept it a secret that Bob would surprise him for Halloween. He likes to hear about it over and over again. How Bob read about him, worked all night, flew to LA all the way from NYC and surprised him. It\u2019s the stuff dreams are made of, except it\u2019s not a dream. It\u2019s real life, and it happened to my son. I will never be able to thank Bob enough.
