Click here for all of the months\u2019 pictures, thoughts and happenings. If you\u2019re on Instagram, be sure to follow me.  \u201cYou\u2019re a boy!\u201d \u201cBaby!\u201d \u201cPink is for girls only!\u201d \u201cLoser!\u201d \u201cYou suck!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not a girl!\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t be my son if you\u2019re gay!\u201d I\u2019m spending the day cleaning and came across a \u201cDrag Book\u201d that CJ made. This page was it. People are saying all of those things to the drag queen. My heart sank when I read the page. It continues to sink. CJ is such a happy and totally loved kid. But he knows exactly what some people think of and say to drag queens. And to gender expansive people. I wish he didn\u2019t know. I wish that wasn\u2019t a page in his book. But it is. \u00a0 Matt: It\u2019s a passport, not a look book. \u00a0 \u201cShall we make a new rule of life\u2026always to try to be a little kinder than is necessary?\u2026It\u2019s not enough to be kind. One should be kinder than needed\u2026we carry with us, as human beings, not just the capacity to be kind, but the very choice of kindness\u2026if every single person made it a rule that wherever you are, whenever you can, you will try to act a little kinder than is necessary \u2013 the world really would be a better place.\u201d \u2013 Wonder, by RJ Palacio. (CJ and I are going on a date tonight to see the movie Wonder.) \u00a0 The sister in the book Wonder says this about her parents and her brother. When I read it I immediately thought \u201cI bet that\u2019s how Chase feels about CJ.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame him. I mean, It\u2019s true. We don\u2019t tell CJ he\u2019s normal or average. But I guess we do try to make him believe it as much as possible. We are stuck in this strange place of not wanting our kids to feel different\u2026but not wanting them to feel normal/average either. Maybe it\u2019s us. Maybe \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201caverage\u201d have negative connotations to us. And \u201cdifferent\u201d has a negative connotation for everyone else. \u00a0 Me: Can I have your lashes, please? My son: Nope. \u00a0 He\u2019s been on a baking kick lately and doesn\u2019t want my help. He wants to do it all by himself. I told him that maybe he shouldn\u2019t use my oven mitts that contain obscenities. He says that the oven mitt applies to the things he cooks just as much as to what I cook. Who\u2019s going to argue with that kind of confidence in the kitchen? (Oven mitt creds: @blue_q) \u00a0 Killing Crazy Hair Day since 2010. \u00a0 CJ hustled people into buying custom rainbow loom bracelets at Thanksgiving yesterday. He pocketed $10 and donated $20 to the LA Food Bank. \u201cI hope those hungry people don\u2019t starve to death before my $20 gets there to buy them food!\u201d \u2014 CJ, age 10, Thanksgiving 2017. \u00a0 There\u2019s no better example of how different my sons are. Or of how I use threatening as a parenting technique.   ", "feedtitle": "Raising My Rainbow"}
