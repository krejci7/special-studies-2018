Click here for pictures, thoughts and happenings from the entire month. If you\u2019re on Instagram, follow me. If you already follow me, thank you! My wife gets a load of emails and messages from people asking where our son\u2019s father is, as though I couldn\u2019t possibly be around and still allow a male son to display female behavior. To those people I say, I\u2019m right here fathering my son. I want to love him, not change him. My son skipping and twirling in a dress isn\u2019t a sign that a strong male figure is missing from his life; to me it\u2019s a sign that a strong male figure is fully vested in his life and committed to protecting him and allowing him to grow into the person who he was created to be. I may be a \u201cguy\u2019s guy,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean that my son has to be. \u2014 Matt \u00a0 \u00a0 What did I expect when I was pregnant and learned I was having another boy? More of the same. Life on repeat. A life of hand-me-downs \u2014 everything from clothes to toys to hobbies. When CJ started showing us that he was differently gendered. I grew frustrated and scared. He wasn\u2019t a card I expected to be dealt. But, as Cheryl Strayed says, \u201cyou don\u2019t have a right to the cards you believe you should have been dealt. You have an obligation to play the hell out of the ones your holding.\u201d I\u2019m holding CJ. A child with special and unique needs because of his gender expression and gender identity. Because he is a boy who is a girl at heart. And, because of what the future could very well hold for him. And, you know what? I\u2019m going to play the hell out of this fabulous, unexpected card I was dealt. I\u2019m going to love him, support him, encourage him, build him up and let him soar. I\u2019m going to hustle for him and kids like him. Don\u2019t sit at the table staring at what you think is a shitty hand, start rearranging those cards and making plans to play the hell out of them. It\u2019s your obligation. Own it. \u00a0 \u00a0 Me: What\u2019s this? CJ: The cover of the new comic book I\u2019m writing. Me: How and why does RuPaul save the day? CJ: I\u2019m not going to tell you yet. But, let\u2019s just say it has something to do with Jinkx Monsoon, a couture gown and grape juice. \u00a0 \u00a0 Her: We\u2019re having a gender reveal! Me: No, you\u2019re having a genitalia reveal. Parents-to-be CAN\u2019T reveal their unborn baby\u2019s gender. In general, gender is what\u2019s in a person\u2019s head that tells them that they\u2019re male or female (or both or neither or some unique combination). A child\u2019s concept of gender starts to develop around age three. So, a child\u2019s third or fourth birthday would be a good time for parents to host a gender reveal. Parents-to-be CAN reveal their unborn baby\u2019s sex. In general, sex is what\u2019s between a person\u2019s legs that tells them they\u2019re male or female. That\u2019s what\u2019s truly revealed at a gender reveal. The fetus\u2019s sex. Its genitals. Its penis or vagina. (Or both if the baby is intersex.) When I attend gender reveal parties and the parents-to-be yell \u201cIt\u2019s a boy!,\u201d I want to yell back \u201cThe baby has a penis!\u201d When they shout, \u201cIt\u2019s a girl!,\u201d I want to shout \u201cThe baby has a vagina!\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 It\u2019s amazing how fast time moves when you\u2019re watching kids grow. The human who made me a mother is 14 years old today. He asked for an electric guitar and spent the weekend as a production assistant on a music video set in Los Angeles. I\u2019d never ask for him to stop growing \u2014 the alternative is my worst fear. I just wish I could slow things down a bit, get him to hug me a little longer and not be in such a damn hurry to be the amazing man he\u2019s destined to be. \u00a0 Shoe shopping with CJ is not fun. His feet are super narrow. One foot is half a size bigger than the other. He\u2019s right smack-dab in the middle of little kids and big kids sizes. Oh, and sometimes he wants shoes from the girls\u2019 section and sometimes he doesn\u2019t. But the shoes in the boys\u2019 section are \u201ctoo serious\u201d and \u201cno fun.\u201d Our tried-and-true solution? Buy plain-ish shoes and customize them. We got shoes from Nordstrom Rack and added velvet shoelaces by Aldo (a different color for each shoe, of course). Then, we added silver star and lightening bolt sticker patches from The Trend bar. \u00a0 \u00a0 Young CJ: I\u2019m going to go dress up like a superhero. Me: Cool. Young CJ: Okay. I\u2019m dressed. Now take a picture of how superhero I am. \u00a0 \u00a0 I thought he\u2019d never be a reader. It didn\u2019t come easy to him. And, in first grade, his teacher taught him that there were \u201cboys books\u201d and \u201cgirls books.\u201d Teachers, please don\u2019t do that. Then, when he started reading the Dork Diaries series, kids at school made fun of him for reading \u201cgirls\u2019 books.\u201d Now, in fourth grade, he doesn\u2019t care what people say about the books he chooses. Lately he\u2019s been tearing through gymnast biographies. \u201cPeople at school think I\u2019m a lady anyway. So, they don\u2019t care what I read.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That time CJ discovered the \u201cbig eyes\u201d art of Margaret Keane and was so inspired that he did his makeup to look like a big-eyed waif from one of her paintings.
