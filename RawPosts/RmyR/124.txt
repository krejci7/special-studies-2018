 We’ve added an awesome new book to our bookshelf! Jacob’s New Dress came out on March 1. We’ve been waiting for it and it didn’t disappoint. Jacob loves playing dress-up, when he can be anything he wants to be. Some kids at school say he can’t wear “girl” clothes, but Jacob wants to wear a dress to school. Can he convince his parents to let him wear what he wants? This heartwarming story speaks to the unique challenges faced by boys who don’t identify with traditional gender roles. Want Jacobs’s New Dress for your bookshelf?  I have a signed copy to give away! For the chance to win, leave a comment below letting us know what book(s) you think gender creative and ally families should have on their shelves. A winner will be announced on Friday. Good luck!
