In the first seven days, the community welcomed more than 150 families from across the US.\u00a0 We have connected families and playdates are being set up in 22 states!  California Connecticut Georgia Idaho Indiana Kansas Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Missouri Nevada New York North Carolina Oklahoma Pennsylvania South Carolina Tennessee Texas Vermont Virginia Washington Wisconsin  We\u2019ve had about a dozen families join from Canada and have playdates in the works in Ontario and Quebec. And, most surprising\u2026we\u2019ve gone international!\u00a0 Families are arranging playdates in:  Australia Ecuador France Scotland Spain  The response has been so great, that we\u2019ve brought on two moderators to help us manage the community.\u00a0 Three cheers and a toast to our bestie Sarah Manley from NerdyApple.com and THE Cory Byrom. Community members who have yet to find other families in their area are gabbing it up in the \u201cCommunity Chat\u201d area.\u00a0 There, we currently have seven different conversations going about everything from school, parenting and where to get fabulous clothes for young gender benders. We remain giddy and emotional about Rainbows At Play and the good things that are happening in the community.\u00a0 Help us spread the word and the sparkle.\u00a0 The more gender creative and ally families that join, the better. Let\u2019s Get Playing! Lori and Kelly * * * Also this week, I attended the Stonewall National Education Project\u2019s 2nd Annual Conference, where I had the chance to meet with educators, administrators and other youth-serving professionals to talk about what it\u2019s like to raise differently gendered child.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m already looking forward to next year\u2019s conference! * * * If you live in Orange County, join Youth Empowered to Act (YETA) and Garden Grove High\u00a0School\u2019s Gay Straight Alliance (GSA) at their upcoming LGBTQ Student\u00a0Rights Community Forum, where attendees will learn about the protections and rights of LGBTQ and allied students.
