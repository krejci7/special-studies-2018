When the kids are in school, there are less \u201cI\u2019m bored\u201d complaints, less money spent, less full layers of sunscreen to apply/reapply, less sand everywhere and there\u2019s more time for me to work, write, watch Netflix and Google random things. But, then, sure as shit, one week before school starts, I start to panic and worry about what the school year holds for gender-nonconforming C.J. I can clearly remember my worries by grade level \u2013 which, as I look back now, are proof that it truly does get better. I\u2019ll take my fourth grade worries over my first grade worries any day. (And, I refuse to think about my middle school worries, so don\u2019t even bring them up. I know it will get worse.) Preschool: Will the kids make fun of C.J. for wearing girl clothes? Will he get teased? Kindergarten: Will the kids make fun of him for drawing himself as a girl and wearing girl socks, jewelry and lip gloss? Will he get teased? First Grade: Will he be comfortable and safe in the boys\u2019 bathroom? Will he get teased? Second grade: I hope his teacher will be more accepting and thoughtful than his last. Will he get teased? Third Grade: He\u2019s been at the same school for four years. I hope he has an accepting and supportive friend in his class. Will he get teased? Fourth Grade: I hope the other kids continue to be cool to him. This year, the hardest part of going back to school was school supply shopping; it\u2019s when I realized how much of his sparkle C.J. tames and edits for school. I know it feels necessary for him, but it feels sad for me. I want to tell him \u201cYou do you! Who cares what other people think! Screw them!,\u201d but I don\u2019t because he can read the crowd of his peers better than I can. Just like I won\u2019t dye my hair purple and let all of my tattoos show at work, C.J. doesn\u2019t wear a skirt or carry a purse to school. We hide our authentic selves sometimes, because it seems like the right or easiest thing to do \u2013 but we let just enough of our true selves show so that we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve surrendered completely. C.J. needed to get spiral notebooks for school. He wanted these: He got these: He needed a binder. He wanted one of these: He got this coral one: He wanted this lunchbox: He got this one (which Chase told us privately is equally as girly and attention-grabbing): He was brave enough to go with these highlighters: As the first day of school got closer, C.J. got more nervous and so did I. The night before, C.J. asked me to help him make sure his French braid was perfect and to paint one of his fingernails blue. If nobody said anything about his nail, he\u2019d paint an additional nail each night until he worked up to two, fully manicured hands. Then, he\u2019d go from blue to a more fabulous color. He\u2019s careful and measured in how much of himself he reveals to people at first. So far so good for fourth grade. He\u2019s worn French braids, ponytails and crimped hair. His nails are polished. The friendship bracelets have started to amass on his wrist. The anxiety has started to subside as we settle into the comfortable routine of the school year. From here until summer, we stand ready for what could happen, but we are more joyful than fearful.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
