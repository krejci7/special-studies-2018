He keeps his four non-boring walks in his arsenal for use pretty regularly throughout the day depending on the location, occasion and audience. He has also been known to do a hybrid of two or three walks if the mood strikes. Let me explain. There\u2019s his Fashion Walk which is pretty much straight from the runways. He gets a real serious face and tries to walk by putting one foot directly in front of the other or crossed over the other if at all possible. His eyes look straight ahead. He erases his usually smile in favor of a serious pout and then sucks in his cheeks. Usually he puts his right hand on his right hip and swings his left hand dramatically.\u00a0 Think angry hungry stomping model. His Fashion Walk is most often used inside of a mall and has been spotting in JC Penny, Forever 21, Nordstrom and Target. When he is doing his Sassy Diva Walk, his rump sticks out a little more than usual and at least one of his wrists hangs limp from the elbow that is kept tightly at his side. Sassy Diva Walk steps are either very short and quick or long fast strides. \u00a0For some reason, this walk requires him to look left and right a lot as if he\u2019s looking for someone he knows, although I\u2019m pretty sure that when you\u2019re doing the Sassy Diva Walk you wouldn\u2019t wave to a friend if you saw him/her because you\u2019re too busy being a sassy diva.\u00a0 Think Beyonce as \u201cSasha Fierce.\u201d This walk is best suited for busy places with a fast pace full of people with things to do. It has been utilized at the local art fair, the end-of-the-school-year carnival and, again, Target. It got the most use on our recent Carnival cruise. The Rock Star Walk is a little out of control and inconsistent. Which I guess is fitting given the name. \u00a0It usually has big sloppy steps that swing a little wide to the sides. His head can bob from side to side or up and down dramatically. \u00a0His arms flail and do all sorts of made up hand signs that I assume he uses to convey that he\u2019s a glittery unpredictable badass who has seen some things in his short life.\u00a0 Think Avril Lavigne meets Pink. The Rock Star Walk is the most \u201cmasculine\u201d of my son\u2019s walks. I\u2019ve seen it used around his brother\u2019s friends, at Dave and Busters, amusement parks and Target (yes, we go there a lot and it is welcoming of all of my son\u2019s walks). I saved his Ballerina Walk for last because it looks to be the most painful. Because he doesn\u2019t have pointe shoes, he curls his toes under his feet and hops up on top of them. He then walks gracefully and painfully with his head held high, shoulders back and arms out to the sides. His lips are sucked inside his mouth, which I believe is because he\u2019s trying to hold in yelps of pain.\u00a0 Think Natalie Portman in Black Swan. This walk can only be safely done on carpet. Which means that few have ever witnessed it.\u00a0 That is for the best because those who have seen it have had to look away as they imagine how much\u00a0it would hurt them to walk that way. His normal walk is just his natural gait and carries him to school and other boring places like the grocery store and Home Depot. \u00a0And that\u2019s fine because I use my normal, boring walk there too. This Friday and Saturday, C.J.\u2019s Dad and I will be walking around New York City.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen most of the major touristy things.\u00a0 What should we do and where should we eat/drink?\u00a0 If you have a recommendation, please leave a comment below or email me at raisingmyrainbow@gmail.com.\u00a0 Thanks!
