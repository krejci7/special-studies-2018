As the oldest child, C.J.\u2019s Brother dutifully held the iPad back in Cali. When he wasn\u2019t looking for boogers up his nose via the small screen in the upper right-hand corner he had the camera pointing towards the ceiling. So, we could see daily that our ceiling was in a state of good repair and our son was picking his nose with the utmost attention to detail. \u201cYou HAVE GOT to go to the bathroom!\u201d she said to me with a giddy urgency. Naturally I hopped right up and headed to the tinkle-torium, not knowing what I was going to see. Blood, guts, gore, pubic hair, diamonds, Ryan Gosling? My bestie, she always keeps me guessing that way. I go through the door to the unisex shared sink area, which is the usual in Greece (and other parts of Europe, I suppose). I never got used to sharing a portion of the powder room. I constantly felt like I had entered the men\u2019s room on accident and, at the same time, it reminded me of that one night at M.J.\u2019s in Silverlake, sharing a bathroom with the mixed masses. I get to the side-by-side toilet doors (one for women and one for men) and this is what I see. A pair of Sylvester little boys underwear indicate the \u201cMen\u2019s Room\u201d and Sleeping Beauty little girls underwear indicate the \u201cLadies\u2019 Room.\u201d C.J. would insist, of course, on making a number one and two with Aurora. I whipped out my iPhone to snap a pic for all of you and the man washing his hands at the sink stared at me and escaped the confined space quickly. I walked out smiling; thanking the Grecian stars that no establishment in Orange County would do such a thing. Little things like that give me pause when C.J. is with me, but make me smile at our quirky adventures when he isn\u2019t around. People now associate me with children\u2019s underwear (read this post to learn why). Is it weird to admit that I\u2019m kind of flattered, because if it is I won\u2019t admit it. * * * In the news this week: A little boy wants to join the Girl Scouts. My initial thought: Holy crap, I haven\u2019t even considered that the scouting age is around the corner and C.J., most likely, will prefer the Girl Scout Friendship Circle to the Boy Scout Wolf Den. Great. My initial thought on the coverage: Good for the Girl Scouts for having a decent, coherent statement. I don\u2019t, however, like that they use the term \u201ctransgender\u201d when they should be saying \u201cgender variant\u201d or \u201cgender nonconforming. Overall: The story may be a step forward for gender creative families. Jenna Lyons, the exec from J. Crew who caused \u201cToemaggeden,\u201d has left her husband of nine years for, allegedly, a woman.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 27 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
