All Posts ha Kindergarten Mother's Day 
 The following excerpts are from a book that C.J. made for me at school for Mother’s Day.  The underlined portions were filled in by C.J. to complete the sentences.  I think my mom is 48 years old.  (I’ll have you all know that he overshot it by 13 years.  Notice on the illustration, he originally went with 30 something — but, upon further consideration, he made me almost 50.)  You can tell she’s a mom because she is beautiful.  (This made up for the fact that he thinks I’m nearly old enough to join AARP)  I think she learned how to be a mom by reading a book.  (This part is true.  Do you like the high heels I wear while reading?)  My mom wanted to have children because she had children.  (That pretty much sums up how it all happened.)  While I’m at school, my mom works.  (If you’ve ever wanted to see what I look like when I’m blogging, here’s a picture.)  My mom is special because she washes the dishes.  (Of all the things that could make me a special mom…..this is it.)  HAPPY MOTHER’S DAY!!!!!!!!
