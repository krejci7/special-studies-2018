My problem has been bothering me for some time now. We have a grandson who is 4 and very much a \u201cprincess boy.\u201d He likes girl toys and dresses and doesn\u2019t like any of his boy toys. We\u2019re at a loss about how to handle this. He\u2019s an adorable little boy and we love him to pieces. His parents don\u2019t accept this behavior, and I\u2019m afraid it will affect him now and in the future. How would you handle this? We don\u2019t say anything to his parents because they are pretty much in denial. \u2014 WORRIED GRANDMA What was Dear Abby\u2019s reply?

Already finding himself the target of bullies, who often taunt him with \u201che-she,\u201d Tony feared he would have to endure even more abuse if he pushed to try out for the boys\u2019 team. So he made a wrenching decision: he quit basketball. Read this New York Times article about the rules and regulations for transgender athletes\u2026and learn if Tony returned to the sport he loves. * * * A Pawtucket (Rhode Island) family has organized a first-of-its-kind support group for young transgender children.
