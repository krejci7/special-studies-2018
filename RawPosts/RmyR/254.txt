 Every year during the holidays we adopt a needy child through my work and we buy her/him the things s/he wants most.  Of course, this year I selected Jonah, age 5, who wanted Justin Beiber’s holiday album, Under the Mistletoe.  C.J. loves that he shares a love of the Beibs with Jonah.  He wanted to meet him and listen to the c.d. together.  Maybe next year. * * * FYI, C.J. is still working on his Christmas list.  It’s two full pages long.  Single spaced.  His brother’s list is half a page long.  C.J. is holding out hope that he will get everything on his list.  This should be interesting. * * * I have a question for you: What books do you read and enjoy that are about growing up LGBTQ and/or parenting a gay child?  I just might want to expand my library (and learn from other people’s mistakes).  Let me know if you have any suggestions. * * * I caught C.J. singing in the bath.  Without further ado….Here is C.J. covering his favorite holiday song, Wham’s “Last Christmas.” (Click the arrow on the player below.)
