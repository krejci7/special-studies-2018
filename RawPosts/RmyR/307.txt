I started this blog for three reasons, one of them being to connect with other primary caregivers who are raising a child like mine.\u00a0 John\u2019s Mom found my blog and e-mailed me.\u00a0 And e-mailed me.\u00a0 And e-mailed me.\u00a0 I\u2019m not exactly prompt in replying to e-mails; I get a lot of them.\u00a0 I\u2019m so thankful that John\u2019s Mom was persistent, because, she was right; our lives are so much the same. \u00a0\u00a0 John wants the \u201cgirl toy\u201d with his Happy Meal at McDonald\u2019s.\u00a0 He loves the Disney Princesses.\u00a0 He likes to slip into his Mary Janes after a long day at preschool.\u00a0 John walked up to us at the park hiding a stuffed animal kitty behind his back.\u00a0 He saw C.J.\u2019s plush Rapunzel doll in full view and the Kitty quickly came out to play. John is marvelous.\u00a0 He\u2019s a bespectacled, long-lashed tender soul with a mop of long sandy brown hair.\u00a0 He wears the same shoes, but in different colors.\u00a0 He\u2019s a magnet for wonder. John\u2019s Mom is equally as cool, bless her soul. She rocks worn cowboy boots and a cardigan with eclectic brooches that John plays with when he feels a little shy.\u00a0 She serves organic strawberries and is dead set, like me, on not changing her little boy, just loving him. John and C.J. both have older brothers\u00a0who are all boy and Dads who, though they may struggle from time to time, love them completely and now know every Disney Princess and her movie of origin. John and C.J. play Stawberry\u00a0Shortcake and Rapunzel, nibble on Disney Princess fruit snacks and go on a discovery hike to look for roly-polys and lady bugs.\u00a0 They are oblivious to looks from other park goers. It\u2019s a first for them, the first time that either boy has played with someone so much like himself. Can you believe that the Rapunzel dress at the Disney Store is $50?! I don't even spend that much money on a dress for myself! -- John's Mom John\u2019s Mom and I sit on a bench and talk.\u00a0 What are your feelings about your son wearing something girly outside of the house?\u00a0 What do you do when your son wants to have a Pinkalicious themed birthday party?\u00a0 Why is the Rapunzel dress at the Disney Store $50!? We both struggle to protect our sons, while also trying to set them free.\u00a0 We have to get creative when it comes to birthday parties, judgmental friends and dressing our effeminate sons. She has tips for me, because she is a year farther along in the adventures in raising an effeminate, fabulous son.\u00a0 She also has warnings.\u00a0 C.J. may start to get embarrassed and withdrawn in the coming year because he may start to realize that he is different.\u00a0 Some of his innocence may fly away as the reality of life creeps in.\u00a0\u00a0 We lose track of time.\u00a0 Our two hours together felt like 10 minutes.\u00a0 We gather our things and our sons in a hurried panic.\u00a0 As they drove away, John says to his mom, \u201cI can\u2019t believe C.J. likes princesses!\u00a0 That is so great that he won\u2019t even make fun of me!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s right John.\u00a0 You\u2019re safe with us.
