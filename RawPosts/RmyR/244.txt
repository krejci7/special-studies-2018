I\u2019m sorry that you got shitty parents.\u00a0 Unfortunately it happens sometimes, though in a perfect world it wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m worried about you and so are a lot of other people.\u00a0 While your future parents are thinking about killing you, we\u2019re thinking about loving you. \u00a0Please always remember that.\u00a0 You deserve to be loved, no matter what, no questions asked, unconditionally, whole-heartedly, not dependent on anything else. I\u2019m especially worried about the two to four percent of you who, statistically speaking, are homosexual.\u00a0 I can\u2019t sugarcoat it, you\u2019re in for one hell of a ride. \u00a0Hold on tight and keep yourself safe. Your parents are stupid enough to believe that sexuality is a choice and don\u2019t know the difference between \u201cyour\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re.\u201d\u00a0 Never let them help you with your homework. I\u2019m sorry that your parents, though they have not been blessed with you yet, have already threatened to beat you, kill you, burn you, make you sleep in the oven, hang you from a bridge, step on your throat, drown you, stab you and/or shoot you.\u00a0 Your parents don\u2019t represent the goodness that can be found in humanity, they represent the worst. It doesn\u2019t mean that you are fated to be like them.\u00a0 It means that you don\u2019t have to do much to be better than them.\u00a0 So start there\u2026then soar. You may just have to raise yourself.\u00a0 Do it right.\u00a0 Go to school.\u00a0 It\u2019s important.\u00a0 Let your mind wander and consider \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d\u00a0 Dream.\u00a0 And know that once you are an adult and on your own you can make your dreams and \u201cwhat ifs\u201d a reality.\u00a0 Do what you can to safely exist until then. Be brave.\u00a0 Be strong.\u00a0 Believe that there are people in this world who will love you, cherish you and support you as you find your way.\u00a0 Seek out your people, find your chosen family.\u00a0 Don\u2019t look back.\u00a0 Know that you were made perfectly.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be hell until you break free from your abusive, murderous parents.\u00a0 Know that and believe that it can get better.\u00a0 That you deserve better. Make an awesome life for yourself.\u00a0 Use their stupidity and a stature in life (or lack thereof) as a motivator to achieve better for yourself.\u00a0 Realize that your parents\u2019 minds are so closed that they aren\u2019t fit for society.\u00a0 Open yours and let it breathe. There are families out there who would welcome you in a heartbeat, no matter which way your heart beats.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to have to believe and trust and search.\u00a0 \u00a0Try not to let prejudice breed prejudice, it won\u2019t do you any good. There\u2019s a possibility that one day your parents will see what a fantastic adult you\u2019ve become.\u00a0 They may realize, with time, that it\u2019s not important who you love, but that you love.\u00a0 And, there may come a time that they learn that violence is not the answer. When and if this happens, you may want to forgive them.\u00a0 Then again, you may not. As I tell my sons every day\u2026. I love you no matter what, C.J.\u2019s Mom** *100 Real Tweets from Homophobes Who Would Murder Their Gay Child: On March 12, 2012, the hashtag #ToMyUnbornChild became a trending topic.
