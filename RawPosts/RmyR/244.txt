I took the kids to the park to let them burn off some energy.\u00a0 C.J.\u2019s Brother was practicing some of his Parkour meets Jackie Chan meets eight-year-old white boy from The O.C. moves while C.J. played with a pink and yellow My Little Pony under one of the slides.\u00a0\u00a0 Another boy ran up to the playground and called out to C.J.\u2019s Brother, turns out they are in the same class and the boy\u2019s name is Kyle. \u201cYou\u2019re brother is playing with a girl toy!,\u201d Kyle said to C.J.\u2019s Brother after a few minutes. \u201cYeah, I know, he\u2019s gender nonconforming,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Brother said, stating the facts and moving on up the ladder to the tallest slide. \u201cOh,\u201d Kyle said following C.J.\u2019s Brother up the ladder.\u00a0 He obviously didn\u2019t understand what the term \u201cgender nonconforming\u201d meant, but it apparently explained why C.J. was playing with a My Little Pony and, so, Kyle moved on.\u00a0 That was that. Are we all just looking for an explanation? Even if we don\u2019t\u2019 understand it? I realized I had been holding my breath, partially to hear better and partially because I panic a little during situations like that.\u00a0 They are situations that we find ourselves in regularly and that have the potential of going all sorts of sideways. I resumed my normal breathing pattern and took a moment to relish in the pride I was feeling for having a kid as kick-ass as C.J.\u2019s Brother, who accepts, defends and protects his girly little brother.\u00a0\u00a0 I like that lately there is no shame in C.J.\u2019s Brother\u2019s life, no fear, no hesitation.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t always that way. For about a year, C.J.\u2019s Brother struggled with C.J.\u2019s gender nonconformity.\u00a0 He\u2019d say things like \u201cwhy does C.J. always have to play with girl toys?\u201d and \u201cwhy can\u2019t C.J. be more like a boy?\u201d\u00a0 The whole thing troubled him and he was struggling. Then, one day after his eighth birthday, we sat him down and told him that there is a name for kids like C.J.\u00a0 They are gender nonconforming.\u00a0 They are boys who like girl stuff and girls who like boy stuff. It seemed to lift a big confusing weight off of C.J.\u2019s Brother\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0 It freed up some space in his brain and heart.\u00a0 There was a reason for C.J. being the way he was.\u00a0 There was a name for it.\u00a0 It made sense. Pink handbag? Check. Mini Cart? Check. Canned veggies? Yuck! When something has a name it changes things.\u00a0 Especially when the name is big and long and official sounding, like \u201cgender nonconforming. Not all families are as lucky when it comes to kids dealing with a gender creative sibling.\u00a0 We lucked out.\u00a0 C.J. absolutely could not have gotten a better big brother.\u00a0 We remind them constantly that they are the very best of brothers.\u00a0 The brightest stars aligned when they were placed together. So, it hit me that day at the park, when something is out in the open, when the mystery is gone, when it is a known fact and has a name, does the power shift back into the hands of the rightful owner? Because, for a moment, Kyle seemingly had the power.\u00a0 He saw a child doing something \u201cdifferent\u201d and alerted others for the sake of amusement and attention.\u00a0 He thought, foolishly, that he was the first to ever do so.\u00a0 Oh, no my friend, we\u2019ve been living this for half of C.J.\u2019s life.\u00a0 Two and a half years of people \u2013 mostly kids \u2014 laughing at C.J.\u2019s defiance of traditional gender norms and pointing it out to others with less than positive intentions. But, when C.J.\u2019s Brother didn\u2019t react the way Kyle expected, when he gave C.J.\u2019s behavior a legit name and, then, not a second thought, the power shifted back into our favor.\u00a0 When we unabashedly own our differences we shed our weakness and cloak ourselves in power.\u00a0 It feels damn good.\u00a0 We wear power well, if I do say so myself. I went to my regular PFLAG meeting last night.\u00a0 How times have changed.\u00a0 When I first started going to PFLAG a decade ago in support of my brother, I was the youngest by far.\u00a0 I was in my early to mid twenties (no need to get specific). Now, my PFLAG family includes junior high and high school students who have to fit the meeting in between homework, athletic practice, tutoring, dinner and bedtime.\u00a0 There are brave kids sitting in our circle who came out to their family at ages 11, 12 and 13, after knowing since early elementary school that they were gay. C.J.'s ballerina, cowboy, pimp hat look. Most of these kids and others who I have met outside of PFLAG decided to be out at school to shift the power back in their favor. \u00a0Secrets give power to the person holding the \u201ctruth\u201d who could possibly expose it.\u00a0 The powerless are the people who the secret belongs to, the person who is scared to death (sometimes quite literally) of their secret being exposed. The bullies, predators, haters and gossips in life move in circles, they sniff out the smallest scent of fear and strike.\u00a0 When there is no fear, no secrets to sniff out and uncover, those people lose their power.\u00a0 The power goes to the rightful owner.
