I was 17. I was looking for a prom date. He asked me to prom. He asked me to marry him. He asked me to start a family. I always said yes. In between all of life\u2019s milestones and years, we slowly made our life, wrote our story. We learned everything about each other. Then we learned some more. Just when we think there\u2019s nothing left to learn, we prove ourselves wrong again. I\u2019ve learned that Matt was born to be a husband and father. It\u2019s what he\u2019s best at. And, he\u2019s good at a lot of things. His love for Chase, C.J. and me has always been loyal, forgiving, unconditional and fierce. I\u2019ve never met anyone who can love like Matt can. When our youngest son started playing with dolls, wearing dresses and acting effeminate, I foolishly wondered if Matt\u2019s love would be less for him that it was for us. Now, four years after our son picked up his first Barbie and refused to put her down, I\u2019ve learned that C.J.\u2019s gender nonconformity has made Matt an even better husband, father and person. Last year at Orange County Pride, we each picked up some of those iconic Human Rights Campaign stickers \u2014 the yellow equal sign in the blue square. I used mine as a bookmark. Without saying a word and while no one was looking, Matt put his proudly on his truck\u2019s bumper. When I saw it, my heart melted, my eyes watered and I took a picture to save on my phone forever. \u201cWhat did the guys at work say about your HRC sticker?\u201d I asked him later. I imagined him driving his massive, lifted truck into the police department lot and possibly getting some stares or slurs. I worried that he took a stance when he didn\u2019t really need to. \u201cNobody said anything and I don\u2019t care if they do,\u201d he said, matter-of-factly. We took Chase and C.J. to Disneyland on Easter Sunday. We only had 30 minutes to spare before our dinner reservations. We were trying to cut quickly across the park to ride the Matterhorn Bobsleds. We were stopped in our tracks by Mickey\u2019s Soundsational Parade. We had to go right or go left. We had to hurry. Chase was impatient. Matt saw Ariel atop a float, headed down Main Street straight for us. He whisked C.J. up, onto his shoulders. \u201cYou take Chase and ride The Matterhorn. I\u2019m staying right here with C.J. so he can see the princesses. We\u2019ll meet you at dinner,\u201d he said. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d I started to argue. \u201cNo. Go,\u201d Matt said, looking at the approaching princesses, not me. Later he told me that C.J. screamed uncontrollably and clapped wildly as the princesses came into his view. He waved to the princesses and lost his words in the thrill of the moment. He was overcome with happiness, and so was Matt. \u201cYou should have seen him. He was out of his mind when he saw them. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him like that. And, I\u2019m glad it was me who was with him. Just me and him,\u201d Matt said over dinner when the kids weren\u2019t paying attention. Initially, I felt a tinge of jealousy because I hadn\u2019t been there to witness C.J.\u2019s unbridled reaction. The jealously faded quickly. I\u2019m glad they shared that moment, forever in their minds. A father and son and the Disney Princesses. The four of us like to watch Modern Family together. We sat down to watch Mitch and Cam\u2019s wedding. As they were saying their \u201cI Dos,\u201d I remembered something irrelevant and unimportant that I wanted to tell Matt. As I turned my head to him, he turned his head to me and asked, \u201cWhy is this making me emotional?\u201d We watched the rest of the episode in happy, sweet silence. Matt has learned that love is love. Between a father and his effeminate son. Between same sex partners.\u00a0\u00a0 Between people. The HRC sticker on his bumper, his steadfastness in the presence of princesses, his emotions when watching two men marry, these are the little moments when I look at my husband \u2014 my hyper-masculine, jock, cop, tough-guy of a man \u2014 and think I could not have picked a better partner for life or father for my children. Happy Father\u2019s Day, Matt. I love you. xoxo, Lori \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
