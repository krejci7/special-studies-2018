C.J. in a dress, sweats and his brother's old shoes. Holding on to Frankie Stein and listening to Britney Spears. And, yes, he's too big for the jogging stroller. My son is gender nonconforming and I consider him to be a specials needs child. \u00a0He is a child and he has special needs.\u00a0 Very special.\u00a0 Like other special needs children, he needs an advocate, a protector, someone who will take a little extra time to explain things to him and someone to educate others on his behalf.\u00a0 That person is me.\u00a0 And, often times it\u2019s exhausting. Some days I\u2019m tired of living and breathing gender issues and it feels like there is no escape. I travel before him, where and when I can, to alert people to his arrival and his uniqueness. I clear the way, often wondering if that\u2019s what\u2019s best.\u00a0 Am I encouraging people to have preconceived notions about him before they meet him?\u00a0 Am I doing him an injustice and disservice by not letting people get to know him and love him as him, gender nonconformity aside.\u00a0 Can his gender nonconformity ever be an aside? Special needs kids are often defined by what they cannot do.\u00a0 My son cannot blend in.\u00a0 He cannot wear boring socks.\u00a0 He cannot resist having his nails painted.\u00a0 He cannot stop dancing when music comes on.\u00a0 He cannot resist the urge to strike a pose for the camera.\u00a0 He cannot play pedestrian games like cops and robbers or cowboys and Indians.\u00a0 He cannot shun a good skirt with lots of \u201ctwirl\u201d to it.\u00a0 He cannot choose to play with a group of boys over a group of girls.\u00a0 He cannot keep his hands off of beautiful hair.\u00a0 He cannot say no to a great craft.\u00a0 He cannot turn the other cheek to things that sparkle, glow, shine or have a good use of color.\u00a0 He cannot conform to traditional gender roles.\u00a0 No way, no how. I love him for all of his \u201ccannots.\u201d\u00a0 But not everybody thinks that they are as special as I do.\u00a0 C.J. has a butterfly fetish lately. He got this one at the local farmer's market. I was in the grocery store the other day and C.J. was wearing Tinkerbell boots, pink sunglasses and beaded accessories of his design.\u00a0 He had a pink plastic microphone and was singing Aqua\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m a Barbie Girl\u201d like he wrote it, sang it and copyrighted it.\u00a0 The produce section truly is his stage.\u00a0 Not everybody wants to be his audience.\u00a0 I get comments.\u00a0 I get looks.\u00a0 I give comments.\u00a0 I give looks.\u00a0 People insinuate and sometimes say flat-out that my son is gender nonconforming because I\u2019ve made him that way.\u00a0 Damn me for encouraging him; him being a special needs child is my fault. If my son had Down Syndrome or Autism or a peanut allergy, they wouldn\u2019t blame me for his special needs.\u00a0 They wouldn\u2019t find fault in me and say that I caused it.\u00a0 I\u2019m thankful that my child is healthy and happy. When your child has special needs all sorts of fears and worries seep in, grab hold and tease your reason.\u00a0 When your child has special needs, so do you.
