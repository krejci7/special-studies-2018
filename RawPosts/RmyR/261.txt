That\u2019s why we don\u2019t wear wigs at the dinner table; it\u2019s getting in your food. Please be careful not to get holes in your tights. Hold still please, I need brush your hair a certain way before I put your wig on. Are you going to do the black lipstick?\u00a0 No? \u00a0\u00a0Good choice. I don\u2019t know who Mr. Goodbar is.\u00a0 Yes, he does make a good bar.  Last week I welcomed questions from you.\u00a0 A few were posted in the comments section of that post and I\u2019ll work on answering one or two every Thursday.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be shy, ask me anything.\u00a0 If you want a little more privacy, you can email questions to raisingmyrainbow@gmail.com (a few people did that this week). Q.\u00a0 \u201cIf science allowed, would a parent chose for their child to be heterosexual if they already knew for a fact that they would be homosexual?\u201d \u2013 Jazmine A. No, I would not, if possible, use science to change my homosexual child into a heterosexual.\u00a0 The thought that some people would consider doing so scares me, mostly for their child\u2019s sake should s/he be a part of the LGBTQ community.\u00a0 Pack the kid\u2019s bags and send them to my house.  Q.\u00a0 What about CJ\u2019s creativity \u2013 does he often make up stories and the like? I imagine if he did they would be patently hilarious. \u2013 Evan A. C.J. is a creative soul.\u00a0 You\u2019re question really made me thing.\u00a0\u00a0 He is just starting to create stories, but will then pass them off as \u201cdreams.\u201d\u00a0 His passion is for art.\u00a0 He will draw detailed pictures with crayons, markers, paints or pencils and explain them to me at length, demanding my full attention.\u00a0 He will also modify pictures in coloring books if the character\u2019s outfit isn\u2019t right or hair isn\u2019t to his liking.\u00a0 He can stay in the lines better than most kids his age, but isn\u2019t afraid to go out of the lines if he feels it will improve the final result.
