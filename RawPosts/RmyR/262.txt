 I’ve had several requests for C.J.’s Brother’s signature dish: Garden Island Soup, which he will one day serve at his restaurant, The Greasy Dream.  We’ve fine-tuned the recipe over the months, as you can see from the original recipe he wrote.  This soup is great, which means my kids will eat it…which I can’t say about a lot of the food I cook. Here are the ingredients, the measurements vary to taste:  Cooked orzo pasta (The kids love that it’s rice-shaped but really pasta. Blows their minds every time. Knorr Homestyle Chicken Stock (with the necessary amount of water to make a broth Fresh rosemary from our garden (and by “garden” I mean “planter”).  Chop it super-fine. Garlic salt  Chicken sometimes, if we have some leftover from another meal   Bring to a boil, simmer awhile.  Enjoy. * * * Ask me anything.  I know some of you have questions for me and, from time to time, I need a writing prompt.  Leave your questions for me as a comment at the end of this post and I promise to get to some of them in the near future.  I wanna see just what you’re wondering.
