 Here are the things that caught my attention this week.  🙂 The Human Rights Campaign Foundation presents Time To THRIVE,  the inaugural national conference promoting safety, inclusion and well-being for LGBTQ youth…everywhere! Time to THRIVE will take place over Presidents’ Day Weekend (February 14-16, 2014) at Bally’s Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The conference provides a “one-stop-shop” opportunity for youth-serving professionals to build the awareness and cultural competency, learn current and emerging best practices, and gather resources from leading experts and national organizations in the field. Check out the conference website:  www.TimeToThrive.org * * * PFLAG National — through its Straight for Equality project — is working on a new resource to invite, educate and engage allies of people who are transgender and gender nonconforming and they need your help!  They are looking for your answers to the following questions: 1. If you consider yourself a trans ally please share your answer to this question: What was the turning point or event that led you to support inclusion and equality for people who are transgender? 2. If you identify as trans or gender nonconforming please share your answer to one of the following questions: Can you share a story about a time where an ally (or lack of one) had a real impact on your life? Based on your personal experience, if you could tell trans allies one thing what would it be?    3. If you are the parent of a trans or gender nonconforming child/youth please share your answer to one of the following questions. If your child is comfortable with providing her/his own feedback, we’d genuinely appreciate the input! What was there the turning point that led you to become an advocate for your child?  What roles have non-family allies played in you/your child’s life? Answer the questions in four to five sentences each and submit your responses to jhenkel@pflag.org.  They’ll review the feedback, and if your response is used for the publication, they will contact you directly to confirm. Only first names, ages and locations (e.g., city and state) will be used in the publication.

Last, but never least, is C.J.’s BFF Twirl (a seven-year-old, gender creative, fashion and design prodigy).  Read Twirl’s thoughts on the looks from the 2014 Golden Globes and wish you had half his style sense.
