  C.J.’s Brother and I are pretty lucky peeps. We are with my BFF and her family, spending the 4th of July holiday in Hawaii. I brought my laptop and had every intention of writing a post for yesterday. Then I rediscovered my love of POG juice and rum and ocean views and just like that…my very best intentions were forgotten….poof. My regular posting schedule will resume on Thursday. Until then….
