Just three things?\u201d I had a hard time believing the brevity of his list. \u201cYes. If I only ask for three things, I\u2019ll probably get all three, right? My chances will be better?\u201d \u201cYeah, probably.\u201d Then, he proceeded to tell me in length about the three items on his wish list. He wanted a jacked that, when you put it on and zip it up, makes you totally invisible. When I told him that an invisible jacket doesn\u2019t exist I broke his heart. Later I suggested to Matt and Chase that we buy C.J. a\u00a0hoodie and when he zips it up we pretend that we don\u2019t see him. Problem solved \u2014 except that neither Matt nor chase thought the three of us could successfully\u00a0pull off ignoring C.J. The second thing that C.J. wanted was a time machine so that he could go WAY back in time and go to a disco roller-skate party and go \u201cnot so far back\u201d in time to play with himself\u00a0as a\u00a0baby. He also wanted to go back to the exact moment he realized that he likes\u00a0\u201cgirl stuff,\u201d not \u201cboy stuff.\u201d\u00a0If the revelation that there is no such thing as an invisible jacket broke his heart, imagine the melancholy he felt upon learning that time machines do not, in fact, exist. I am the crusher of dreams and ruiner of Christmas. I waited for him to tell me about the third thing he wanted and hoped with all my might that it would be something a little more\u00a0realistic (and, preferably, orderable from Amazon). Nope. He wanted a life-size stuffed animal giraffe. When we got home I opened my laptop and showed him several of the largest\u00a0plush giraffes I could find. We\u2019re talking four to five feet in height. \u201cHow tall is a real giraffe?\u201d I googled for an answer when I should have just said \u201cfour to five feet.\u201d Real giraffes are 18 feet, so, naturally, C.J. does not want a four or five foot tall plush giraffe. \u201cCan you think of anything else you might want? Besides those three things?\u201d \u201cA clear hamster ball big enough from me to get in and run around in. A human size hamster ball.\u201d Later that night, I sat down with C.J. and helped him create an Amazon Wish List. I let him click away and grow his list until his heart was content \u2014 to make up for the afternoon\u2019s invisible-jacket-time-machine-giraffe-height devastation. C.J. found 67 on Amazon that he has to have. Amazon.com \u00a0 He wants this seven-inch Taylor Lautner doll to match the three Jacob Black/Taylor Lautner/Twilight posters he has hanging above\u00a0his bed. Amazon.com He also wants this 11-inch Taylor Lautner doll. Amazon.com And, he wants this seven-inch Taylor Lautner doll. Because a boy can never have too many\u00a0Taylor Lautner dolls. Target.com These heels for when he \u201cgoes to a party or\u00a0has dance parties around the house.\u201d Amazon.com Because I watched it with him once and he says \u201cit\u2019s one of the best movies of all time.\u201d I have to agree. Amazon.com Who hasn\u2019t loved Polly Pocket at some point in their life? (\u201cMe\u201d Matt said.) Amazon.com These are like the new Troll dolls that they had when I was a girl. Amazon.com I had one of these when I was a girl. They are $50 now. That\u2019s not how much they were when I was little. FYI. Amazon.com The new Monster High doll\u2019s name is Invisi Billy. He\u2019s the son of the Invisible Man and \u201chas a look that\u2019s all his own.\u201d Amazon.com He wants these so that he can play Disney Infinity with his brother. Amazon.com It\u2019s the closest thing to a human hamster ball I/Santa could find. *** Happy holidays to all of you and let\u2019s catch up again in 2015! xoxo, Lori \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
