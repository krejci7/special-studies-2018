C.J.\u2019s Dad and I were on The TODAY Show yesterday.\u00a0 It was definitely a once in a lifetime experience.\u00a0 (C.J. and his Brother were most impressed that we were in the same vicinity as Ariana Grande, who performed on the show that day.) Here\u2019s a link to an article on the TODAY website and our clip from the show. Now, I know I\u2019ve been slacking off on writing new posts during the last few weeks.\u00a0 If you are hungry for my words, check out one (or all!) of these pieces. Boys Who Wear Pink Aren\u2019t Just Internet Sensations I wrote this piece for Time about how stories about boys playing with gender come out of nowhere and cause massive public reactions. And then, as quickly as they arrived, they disappear. It\u2019s disappointing that no one event nor all of them as a whole has had the power to inspire and sustain a lasting conversation that raises awareness, understanding and acceptance of little boys who don\u2019t conform to traditional gender norms. \u2018Are the kids going to tease me today?\u2019: Sending my rainbow child back to school In this piece for CNN, I write about how there is a bit of dread that grows inside me with the start of every school year. I\u2019m one of those moms who fight back tears the first few weeks of school \u2014 not because the separation from my children for six hours a day five days a week is too much to handle, but because I fear for the safety and acceptance of my youngest son, C.J., who is gender nonconforming. Understanding Gender Nonconforming Children\u00a0 I\u2019m traveling from New York to Washington to be on The Diane Rehm Show (NPR).\u00a0 It will be a live one-hour talk about gender nonconforming children.\u00a0 Thursday, Sept. 5 \u00a0at 11:06 a.m. EDT.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be in great company.\u00a0 Fellow guests include:  Andrew Solomon writer and lecturer on psychology, politics and the arts; author of \u201cFar From the Tree: Parents, Children and the Search for Identity.\u201d Dr. Edgardo Menvielle psychiatrist and director of gender nonconforming youth program at Children\u2019s National Medical Center in Washington, D.C.
