 A few months ago, Gender Spectrum launched Gender Spectrum Lounge, a digital space for gender non-conforming and transgender children, their families and the variety of professionals to share their stories and experiences.  It’s a great place to exchange ideas, confide and discuss the topics that are most important to our community in a safe, secure and supportive digital platform.  For the safety and security of everyone involved there are few steps to join the Lounge.  I’m sure you can understand why.  It’s totally worth it.    Also, Gender Spectrum has a national call-in support group.  It’s a conference call that takes place on the last Wednesday of each month from 5 to 7 p.m. (PST).  Contact them to learn more at 510.567.3977 or info@genderspectrum.org.   * * *   Have you ever heard someone say that the worst thing they can imagine for their child is for them to be gay?  I have.  Read one women’s response in this blog post.  My favorite line of hers is “Get a fu*king clue.” Thanks to the Raising My Rainbow reader who sent this my way!  * * *  DreamWorks and Honda Center in Anaheim invited us to the premiere of the How To Train Your Dragon Live Spectacular.  It was really an amazing show and C.J.’s Brother has given it two thumbs us.  They have just released more than 800 new tickets across the seven previously sold out performances.  Get tickets at ticketmaster.com or by calling (800) 745-3000.  If you’re not in OC, you should see the show if/when it hits your town.
