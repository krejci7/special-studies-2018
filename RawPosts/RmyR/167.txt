C.J. made this at his fine art summer camp today. He says it\u2019s the best picture that he\u2019s ever done. I agree. After awhile, she touched on the subject of C.J. being different and liking girl stuff.\u00a0 She had volunteered in his classroom throughout kindergarten and had seen him gravitate toward pink and purple, be the only boy to play house, carry a Monster High lunchbox and draw himself as a girl. Because I work, I only volunteered in C.J.\u2019s class once last year.\u00a0 His dad did it a handful of times.\u00a0 I often wondered what the moms who volunteered on a weekly basis thought of my son. \u00a0There were at least three of them who were in the class so often that I wondered if they were on the payroll. I assumed they had chatted amongst themselves about C.J.\u2019s effeminate ways at least a few (or 250) times.\u00a0 I know how Orange County moms talk. \u00a0They may have even brought it up to his teacher.\u00a0 But they had never, not until now, in the safety of summer, brought it up to me. \u201cC.J. is gender nonconforming,\u201d I said matter-of-factly and with a kind smile. Her eyes immediately darted to C.J.\u00a0 Yes, he was within earshot.\u00a0 She looked at me and jerked her head toward him to indicate that he could hear what I was saying. \u201cOh, he knows he\u2019s gender nonconforming,\u201d I assured her. C.J. looked up and smiled at me.\u00a0 Then, he went back to playing a complicated pat-a-cake game with his girl friend. For C.J. knowing that he is gender nonconforming is like knowing that he has red hair, hates ketchup and that high-fives feel too aggressive.\u00a0 It\u2019s a fact.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that makes him who he is, but doesn\u2019t totally define him \u2014 even though, for us, some days it feels like it does. When he got home from camp, C.J. busted out his Easy Bake Oven and whipped these up. The mom was swimming in an awkward silence.\u00a0 Staring at her daughter because she didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u00a0 I watched her swim for a minute or two.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t rush to make her feel safe. \u201cHow did you explain that to him?\u201d she finally asked. \u201cWell, we didn\u2019t.\u00a0 He explained it to us.\u00a0 Not in so many words, but he\u2019s always been a boy who only likes girl stuff.\u00a0 We just gave him the term once we learned it.\u00a0 And, that was so long ago now that it\u2019s like he\u2019s never known life without that phrase,\u201d I explained.\u00a0 \u201cHe uses it just as much as we do now.\u201d \u201cBut, other kids don\u2019t know what it means,\u201d she stated. \u201cMost don\u2019t, but he explains it to them if he feels comfortable doing so.\u00a0 Some kids hear that big-sounding term and don\u2019t ask what it means.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure it sounds too confusing to even deal with,\u201d I said. \u201cDo parents ever get mad when he explains it to their child?\u201d she asked.\u00a0 I wondered if she would have gotten mad if C.J. had explained gender nonconformity to her daughter prior to our conversation. I took a second. Safety first. C.J. always buckles up his babies. \u201cIf they do, they don\u2019t tell me.\u00a0 But, you know, I equate it to kids letting other people know that they have some other special or unique need.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that is beneficial for others to know and to keep the child safe, but doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be declared,\u201d I explained. She got silent again.\u00a0 She was thinking.\u00a0 She was uncomfortable. \u201cHe also knows what it means to be transgender and homosexual,\u201d I said. \u201cCome on, honey.\u00a0 We have to get you to swim lessons,\u201d she called to her daughter. Maybe I should get better at small talk.\u00a0 Or maybe I shouldn\u2019t tell my son so much.\u00a0 The jury is still out.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
