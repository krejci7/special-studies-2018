My Notes: It takes a family to launch a gender nonconforming child\u2026but, that\u2019s not necessarily what a sibling wants to do or how they want to spend their time.\u00a0 Are we asking siblings to step outside their comfort zone and/or do too much? Two important jobs of a parent are to help the child be their authentic self and to keep them safe.\u00a0 When you are raising a gender diverse child, sometimes it feels like those two jobs are at odds. Siblings are an often forgotten \u2014 but critical \u2014 part of the family support system. They outlive the parents.\u00a0 They are part of the same generation. \u00a0\u00a0And, they need support too. Siblings can be that child\u2019s best ally or worse foe, depending on the circumstances. Sometimes the sibling has the ability to \u201cout\u201d their gender diverse sibling.\u00a0 They hold a lot of power.\u00a0 What will they do with that power?\u00a0 Are they being asked to keep a huge family secret? \u00a0Is that fair? Siblings typically want to help, but they don\u2019t know what to do or say and that can lead them to feel inadequate. Siblings can grow resentful of all the focus on gender. What do siblings need?  Empathy about their own anxieties, confusions and vulnerabilities. A place where they can air their own feelings out independently.\u00a0 They need their own space and often don\u2019t get it. A dialogue between only the siblings (with an adult as a listener).\u00a0 The siblings talk honestly.\u00a0 How does it feel to be gender diverse?\u00a0 How does it feel to have a gender diverse sibling? A toolkit.\u00a0 What will they say and/or do when they get various questions and reactions from other kids?  7/14/13 at 3:47 p.m. \u2014 I attended a workshop put on by the Human Rights Campaign. A while ago, the HRC surveyed 10,030 LGBT identified youth between the ages of 13 and 17 and issued the findings in a report titled\u00a0 \u201cGrowing up LGBT in America.\u201d You can access the report here;\u00a0http://www.hrc.org/youth/about-the-survey-report#.UeLNSqWVh65 From that original report, two other reports were compiled and issued recently. The Coming Out Experience for LGBT Youth;\u00a0 http://www.hrc.org/youth/download-the-report/#.UeLVH6WVh64 Supporting and Caring for our Latino LGBT Youth;\u00a0http://www.hrc.org/youth/#.UeLVP6WVh64 Now, they\u2019ve announced that there will be a third report.\u00a0 And it\u2019s about gender and the emerging self-definitions young people are using to label their own gender.\u00a0 I got a sneak peek at some of the findings. Here are some interesting things that I can share: Of the 10,030 LGBT identified youth who were surveyed 925 identified as \u201c\u201dtransgender or gender other.\u201d Of those 925, 89% reported that they are living with members of their family.\u00a0 Where are the other 11% of these 13 to 17 year olds living?\u00a0 As a mom, that worries me. From those 925 \u201ctransgender or gender other\u201d youth, 18 gender categories emerged as the youth self-defined their gender. Here are the categories:  Gender queer\u00a0 (37% of participants) Androgynous (16% of participants) Gender fluid (9% of participants) Bigender General non-binary Both Other female Other male Gender as object Third gender Middle Questioning Genderless General person Neutral None Neither Unknown  That\u2019s all I can offer you for now.\u00a0 The HRC\u2019s Gender Report is in the final stages and will be available this fall.\u00a0 I can\u2019t wait. 7/13/13 at 3:45 p.m. \u2014 I spoke today on the Parent Empowerment Panel: Working With Schools In Service Of My Gender Diverse Student with Johanna Eager from Welcoming Schools. \u00a0She provides professional development to schools and school districts that are interested in implementing Welcoming Schools by using their tools, resources and lessons. \u00a0It\u2019s a project of the HRC and, better yet, it\u2019s free to districts! \u00a0WelcomingSchools.org. Me. Speaking. Also on the panel was Lisa Keating, the mother of an eight year old son who blurs the lines between boy and girl. \u00a0She is also the founder and executive director of My Purple Umbrella. \u00a0The mission of \u201cMy Purple Umbrella\u201d is to provide a fun, loving, safe and creative environment for gender independent children 13 and under through play. They also provide a support network for families and caretakers. \u00a0Check it out at\u00a0mypurpleumbrella.org 7/13/13 at 3:04 p.m. \u2014 Attended The Biology of Gender Workshop led by Stephen M. Rosenthal, MD. Dr. Rosenthal is a pediatric doctor at UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital and director of endocrine clinics at UCSF and led an effort to create a Child and Adolescent Gender Center to treat the condition known as gender identity disorder and to offer medical and psychological care. Gender Identity Disorder is now called Gender Dysphoria. Core Diagnostic Criteria:  Persistent desire to be the other gender or insistence that s/he is the other gender. Clinically significant emotional distress. No concurrent physical \u201cintersex\u201d condition.  Other Things I Learned:\u00a0 How common is the transgender condition?\u00a0 Not rare.\u00a0 1 in 12,000. Children of parents who pressure them to conform to \u201ctraditional gender norms\u201d are almost four times more likely to attempt suicide and use drugs. * * * The first workshop I attended was\u00a0Parenting for Greater Freedom of Gender Expression and Experience. Workshop leader Abigale Ada Grace introduced herself and then said: \u201cI\u2019m female body and female born and I\u2019m comfortable in that.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t feel comfortable as a \u2018girl.\u2019\u201d Yes!\u00a0 This! Things I Learned:  Your Gender Experience is what you take in. What you observe.\u00a0 What you experience.\u00a0 It\u2019s the reactions to your gender expression that you notice and absorb.\u00a0 You don\u2019t really have much of a choice when it comes to your Gender Experience. When another parent cries as they struggle with their child\u2019s gender identity, I cry too.\u00a0 I should have packed tissues.    ", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
