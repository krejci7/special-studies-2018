 Hey peeps, this week I was approached by a devoted Raising My Rainbow and Queerty reader who has a few questions for us. Cameron is a 19-year-old who runs the Gay-Straight Alliance at his high school in Ontario, Canada.  He’s looking for advice on coming out and/or supporting those who are coming out.  I’m just as eager as Cameron is to read your answers and advice.  You can reply via posting a comment at the end of this blog post or e-mail me discreetly at RaisingMyRainbow@gmail.com and I’ll pass your advice on to Cameron.  See Cameron’s e-mail below.  Thanks for your help!    I'm coming out, I want the world to know.... “Calling all mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, friends and of course gays! Coming out is something that calls on not only one person, but their entire support group. This can include parents, friends and teachers. So, what advice would you give to the support group – the people supporting someone who has made the decision to come out and live their life as who they are. I am a high school student in Ontario, Canada and I run a GSA at my school. We recently discussed support groups at one of our meetings, and I am very interested in the opinions of others in regards to this. Sincerely, Cameron”
