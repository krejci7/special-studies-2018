I would have told you about the trip earlier, but my hubby, being the lawman that he is, didn\u2019t want me to alert anyone to our house being vacant.\u00a0 Which point I argued because our house wasn\u2019t vacant, his parents were here watching C.J. and his brother.\u00a0 Oftentimes I lose my arguments before they have begun.\u00a0 Anyway, I\u2019m back. Thank you to those of you who emailed to check on me.\u00a0 I am alive and well and jet lagged. Daddy and C.J. carved a pumpkin. C.J. took his time drawing the hair one strand at a time. More of you emailed to see if C.J. has selected a Halloween costume.\u00a0 Yes, he has. \u00a0After much consideration \u2013 with particular attention given to your suggestions found here \u00a0at the end of my post \u2013 he has decided to go as Frankie Stein from Monster High.\u00a0 She\u2019s the 15-year-old daughter of Frankenstein.\u00a0 Stay tuned for more to follow on our Halloween festivities and/or calamities. News flash! \u00a0The BBC has published an article about Raising My Rainbow\u2026in Portuguese.\u00a0 Hope it says nice things.\u00a0 Thanks for caring, seriously! C.J.\u2019s Mom   ", "feedtitle": "Page 27 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
