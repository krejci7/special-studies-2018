I love C.J.\u2019s mom.\u00a0\u00a0She is my very best friend and my soul sister.\u00a0\u00a0We have been besties for more years than I care to say for fear of revealing our scandalously young age\u2026 Ha! KK\u2019s kids and C.J.\u2019s Brother I also love C.J. and his brother as if they were my own.\u00a0\u00a0My husband and I have two children as well and they have all been raised together since birth.\u00a0\u00a0Brothers, sisters, cousins\u2026they may not have these titles officially, but they are family.\u00a0 We are family. As many families do, we have holiday traditions, non-traditions, random outings of all sorts and this holiday season was no different.\u00a0\u00a0Our two clans came together just before Christmas at a local amusement park for some seasonal fun and the standard picture with Santa.\u00a0\u00a0C.J.\u2019s mom and I both agreed to dress the kids in festive attire so that we would have ourselves a great picture for years to come. However, as I helped my nine-year-old daughter assemble her outfit for the day, I realized for the first time that I had reservations about her overly zealous use of accessories and things that glitter.\u00a0\u00a0The fact was, we were going to be spending the entire day in public with C.J.\u00a0\u00a0He would not be in full C.J. regalia and I did not want to make him feel jealous or uncomfortable.\u00a0\u00a0I did not have to even explain it to my daughter, just the simple mention of who our party included was reason enough for her to tone it down.\u00a0\u00a0Even something inside of her knew. Our 2012 picture with Santa The day was crisp and the kids all looked adorable in their layers.\u00a0\u00a0C.J. was wearing his dark washed jeans, holiday appropriate red henley and super cool black motorcycle jacket.\u00a0\u00a0The other three children were also dressed in gender-typical chilly weather, holiday clothing.\u00a0\u00a0The day itself was a success.\u00a0\u00a0Us adults took turns riding different attractions with the kids as to not give any one parent total nausea from the spinning and jerking death traps. Once all the fun was had at the park we set out for a conjoined family dinner at the nearby Mexican restaurant to conclude the day.\u00a0\u00a0After dinner we went our separate ways and called it a night.\u00a0\u00a0All things considered it was a normal outing enjoyed by all. It wasn\u2019t until the next day that I realized that, in fact, it was not a normal day at all.\u00a0\u00a0I could not immediately pinpoint it but there had been something off.\u00a0\u00a0The entire day had an air about it that was just wrong.\u00a0\u00a0After some more thought I decided to go back through my phone and look at the pictures from the day.\u00a0\u00a0And there it was\u2026in color right before my eyes.\u00a0\u00a0I was staring at the picture of the kids with Santa.\u00a0\u00a0All of them were smiling, looking as cute as ever.\u00a0\u00a0And then there was C.J., smiling, but also fighting with himself.\u00a0\u00a0Holding his tiny little hands together, fighting the urge to strike a fabulous pose and pop his hip just so\u2026 KK\u2019s Daughter and C.J. having a fashion show You see, I have been a passenger on this journey with C.J.\u2019s Mom from the beginning but in many respects I am still an outsider looking in.\u00a0\u00a0Our families are so blended that almost all of our outings, trips and week long vacations end with us in the comfort of one of our homes, together.\u00a0\u00a0It is there that C.J. is able to be his true self.\u00a0\u00a0Either wrapped in his own dress up clothes or in my daughter\u2019s hand me downs, this is C.J.\u00a0\u00a0It had been some time since we spent an entire day with \u201cpublic C.J.\u201d only.\u00a0\u00a0And, as I stared at the picture my heart broke.\u00a0\u00a0My heart broke for C.J. and for my best friend and for C.J.\u2019s Brother and Father. \u00a0The trials and tribulations are just beginning. Although I was witness to this day\u2019s internal battle for C.J., they live with this day in and day out. \u00a0C.J.\u2019s Mom and Dad will have to struggle every day with the public versus private C.J. \u00a0How much of his true self do you allow him to show and still be able to protect him from the judgment of others? \u00a0C.J.\u2019s brother has many of these hard days in front of his as well. \u00a0How does he use his words \u2014 not his fists \u2014 to help the other children understand that C.J. is special because of his differences and not to be the subject of childhood tortures? \u00a0How do you balance a free and open spirit with a close-minded world? I can only imagine what it is to struggle with the biggest part of yourself every day, your heart!\u00a0\u00a0We all struggle each day with something, those pesky 10 pounds, a bad hair day or the cranky boss/toddler/husband/insert noun here.\u00a0\u00a0But, to fight your true self each day at five years old?\u00a0 That is earth shattering. KK\u2019s Daughter and C.J. in Colorado As much as my heart is broken, it is also full of pride.\u00a0\u00a0I am proud of C.J. for not letting the world quell his fire.\u00a0\u00a0He is not at a point in his life where he has to claim a stake into one side of the fence or the other, although some may expect it.\u00a0\u00a0But he is not allowing the expected to totally define him.\u00a0\u00a0He is C.J\u2026gender non-conforming.\u00a0\u00a0My hope is that he won\u2019t always have to struggle between the \u201cPublic C.J.\u201d and the \u201cPrivate C.J.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0If the two could just come together, the world would see one amazing child. I would be remiss if I did not mention the overflowing amount of pride I have in my very best friend.\u00a0\u00a0Not every parent is equipped to handle a child that requires more\u2026 more help, more understanding, more patience.\u00a0\u00a0However, C.J. knew what he was doing when he picked her as his mother, there truly would be no better fit.\u00a0\u00a0C.J.\u2019s mom is a remarkable woman and I am privileged to be her friend. A strong woman stands up for herself, but the strongest women stand up for others.\u00a0\u00a0You my friend are among the strongest! I love you.
