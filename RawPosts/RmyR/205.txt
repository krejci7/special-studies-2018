Surprise Box and it was sent to me by author/illustrator and Raising My Rainbow reader Genevi\u00e8ve Labelle of Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec. \u201cAt one time, there was pink-only colouring books aimed at little girls filled with princesses and charming princes and blue-and-khaki-only colouring books roaming with superheroes and brave firemen. Between them, nothingness.\u00a0 The nature of each one of us is more complex than what is offered by the mass culture industry for which colouring books are powerful promotional items.\u00a0 Genevi\u00e8ve Labelle proposes an heteroclite collection of drawings that incites us to rise above stereotypes. This page from the book is soooooo C.J. This amusing colouring book will satisfy anyone who believes that identity is a conception of the self that is always under construction, just like the Montreal\u2019s Olympic Stadium\u2019s roof.\u201d C.J. loves the coloring book and it provides a humorous read for adults too.\u00a0 To learn more or order, click here.

What will he do? With the help of his two dads he makes a surprising decision.
