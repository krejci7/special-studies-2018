 When I started this blog a year ago, I promised myself that I would give it a 12-month commitment and, then, reevaluate.  I’ve done that.  I’ve decided to keep on blogging, I’m just not sure if I’ll stick to my stringent publishing schedule of two posts per week.  If that were the goal, I’ve already failed in 2012!  Whoopsies!  While I get myself refocused and rededicated, here are links to some news stories that have captured my attention recently.  We have some important stuff to cover in the coming weeks, including C.J.’s fifth birthday and his new ballet/tap combo class.  More soon.  Thanks for sticking around! “Open Letter to Parents: Your Kid Might Be Gay”, Huffington Post, 1/5/12 “Dear Customer Who Stuck Up For His Little Brother”, sweetupndown.tumblr.com, 1/3/12 “Riley on Marketing”, YouTube, 5/6/11 “The ‘genderless baby’ who caused a Storm of controversy in 2011”, TheStar.com, 12/26/11 “IT”, darlenetandogenderblog.wordpress.com, 12/20/11 “It’s Okay to be Neither”, RethinkingSchools.org, Fall 2011
