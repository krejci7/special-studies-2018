 First, stop everything you’re doing and read The Mother Company’s interview with my rad hubby, Matt.  A lot of times when they see our son wearing a dress or playing with dolls, people ask “Where’s the kid’s father?!”  To that I say, he’s right here, by my side, being equally awesome, loving and supportive of both of our sons – no matter their likes, dislikes, gender expression, gender identity, etc. When you’re done reading the interview, be sure to come back here, we have a lot to cover this week. * * * And, the winner of this week’s book giveaway is….Teresa Kander!
