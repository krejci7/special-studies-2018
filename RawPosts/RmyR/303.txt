My kids love garage sales. To say that one man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure doesn\u2019t do their excitement for garage sales justice.\u00a0 They always want to buy other people\u2019s crap and I can\u2019t very well tell them that it\u2019s crap with the owner of said crap standing right there in front of us. And, what did C.J. just HAVE to have?\u00a0 Out of everything spread on old, gross blankets on the dirty, cracking driveways?\u00a0 This book. For Better or Best: Understand Your Man by Gary Smalley. I tried to steer him towards something a little more age-appropriate.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t having it.\u00a0 I tried to steer him towards any other book.\u00a0 Nope, not interested. He can\u2019t read.\u00a0 Obviously.\u00a0 So, why does he like this book so much?\u00a0 He tells me that he likes to look at the numbers; and, by numbers he means words.\u00a0 The book has gone everywhere with C.J.: to bed, to the bathroom, in the car, to Nana Grab Bag\u2019s house, to Target, everywhere. There\u2019s no telling why kids like certain things, especially C.J.\u00a0 I guess I should look on the bright side, the back cover explains that after reading the book he will \u201cunderstand not only the way men think, but also how to move a man\u2019s heart.\u201d   ", "feedtitle": "Page 31 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
