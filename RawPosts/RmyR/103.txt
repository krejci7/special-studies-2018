But, here I am asking for something. I am on the board of the Orange County Equality Coalition\u2019s School Compliance Task Force. Which is a long away of saying that I\u2019m part of a group of people who are dedicated to making sure that schools in our county are treating LGBTQIA youth equally and abiding by the laws the state set forth to protect them. This coming Thursday is our annual fundraiser. It\u2019s a fancy gala. I will wear a cocktail dress and heels and stay out past 10 p.m. \u2013 that\u2019s how important it is. You\u2019re invited, you can buy tickets here. It\u2019s only $35 dollars for some wine, small bites, entertainment and good company. More than that, we are having a silent auction. Can you please check out the items up for bid and considering bidding? You\u2019ll notice you can bid on a copy of my book and a lunch/coffee date with me. I\u2019d love to meet you! Please bid! Monies raised will fund the monitoring and support of Orange County schools in their efforts to comply with state and federal anti-discrimination laws, safe school laws and the FAIR Education Act. * * * Some of my best friends are writing powerful things.
