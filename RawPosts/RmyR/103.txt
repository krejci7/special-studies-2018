 C.J.’s favorite thing to do right now it put on elaborate fashion shows. Each one takes days of concentration and preparation. Some days he can hardly focus and sit still long enough to complete his second grade homework, but he can spend hours on his latest show. If fashion shows were a school project he’d get an A++. But, alas, he is graded on things like reading, not runways. Here’s his to-do list for each show:  Decide on a theme, trend and inspiration Create the stage and runway (he most often uses his Build-A-Bear’s bed as the runway) Choose music (Kesha remains his favorite) Make sure he has enough fishing line to suspend the models Pull looks Select models Write an intro to the show Appoint an emcee (it’s always me because he says he’s too busy worrying about the details to do this) Hire a cameraman (Chase always does this even though he’d rather be playing The Sims) Have a dress rehearsal Find an audience (that’s always Matt) Put on the fashion show (at last)  C.J. wanted me to share one of his fashion shows with you. (You will quickly see that I am an amateur at iMovie and he deserves better than me. But, I’m what he’s stuck with.) Also, he wants you to know that at 2:12 in the video “the grand finale starts and the models start dancing on the runway and being crazy girls and they are wearing fancy dresses because they are going to a wild party when the fashion show is over.”
