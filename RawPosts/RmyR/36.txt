It\u2019s a different kind of Christmas in our house this year. It\u2019s C.J.\u2019s first Christmas knowing that thing about Santa that only bigger kids and grown ups know. This year, C.J. handed over his Christmas wish list only after confirming multiple times that \u201cknowing gets you just as many presents as believing.\u201d I guess he would start un-knowing and re-believing if my answer had been no instead of yes. Let\u2019s just dive right into his list, because the item at the top managed to shock even the world\u2019s reigning drag queen \u2013 so there\u2019s really no subtle way for me to introduce it. Hip pads to wear while in drag: He\u2019s heard all about them on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race and has caught glimpses of queens making them and tending to them on the show; now he wants his own set. Or pair. Or however you address them to mean one for each hip. Oh, and butt. When he told this to Bob The Drag Queen, Bob was surprised and gave a fabulous, hearty chuckle. Bob said that a queen usually makes her hip pads based on the size and age of the woman she is going to be. What do you do if your queen is a nine-year-old boy who wants to be a 20-something man being a 30-something woman?  Drag Makeup and Drag Clothes: Per family tradition, we visited an amusement park yesterday. I\u2019ve had my kids\u2019 Santa pictures taken there since they were born. I asked C.J. if he wanted to sit on Santa\u2019s lap and get his picture taken given this year\u2019s enlightenment. He said yes. We stood in line and he walked maturely up to Santa and took a seat. C.J.: I don\u2019t believe in you anymore, but I wanted to tell you that I want drag makeup and drag clothes for Christmas. You know, just in case. Santa: That sounds great! Uncle Michael is in charge of checking drag makeup off the list. Now I guess it\u2019s up to me to find drag clothes in youth size 8/10. These crazy-ass shoes: I\u2019ve ordered them from China and they are lost in transit and the seller won\u2019t return my emails. So, if you all could say a prayer or do a missing-LED-sneaker-rave-footwear dance, that would be awesome. Of everything on the list so far, I thought this would be the easiest gift to get. I was wrong. Photo creds: Amazon Olympic regulation trampoline: Apparently the 12-foot trampoline we have in our backyard is too small for C.J.\u2019s Olympic dreams. He now wants a 10ft by 17ft behemoth that is hand-woven and weighs 573.2 pounds. The price tag is $5,000 and I didn\u2019t see it in any Black Friday ads. Why can\u2019t my kid be normal and want a Hatchimal like all the other kids? Flex Seal: Me: What on earth are you going to do with liquid rubber? C.J.: Make a boat and a cup. Photo creds: Flex Seal Jeggings with rips and holes in them: This has become an annual request due to growth. C.J.: I need new ones because when they get too small for you, girls\u2019 pants really crush a guy\u2019s nuts. Crocheted mermaid tail: He saw this somewhere and wanted me to crochet it for him. I\u2019ve taken one one-hour crocheting class at Jo-Ann\u2019s, so my skill level isn\u2019t exactly capable of mythical creatures. I was so flattered by his confidence in me, that I bought him one from Zulily. Photo creds: Zulily Rainbow light for his room: If you ever need to find C.J.\u2019s room in the dark, it will be the one with the bright rainbow beaming out of it. Of course. Photo creds: Amazon Lego Amusement Park: 1124 pieces. And I will step on every damn one of them. Photo creds: Amazon Luckily, C.J. is a pretty thankful and easily excitable person. He\u2019s going to be very pleased with what\u2019s under the tree this year. Happy holidays to you all! If the holidays aren\u2019t happy for you, please know that I\u2019m thinking about you.\u00a0 Remember, you are not alone \ud83c\udf08 If you need support, reach out to The Trevor Project 24/7 at: 866.488.7386.
