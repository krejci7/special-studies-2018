I admit it; I can very easily get myself all worked up when people talk ignorantly about LGBTQ issues.\u00a0 Even when the person talking ignorantly is five years old.\u00a0 I should have more self-control, but I don\u2019t.\u00a0 So there. \u201cMom, Marina from my class told me that boys can\u2019t marry boys,\u201d C.J. said as he climbed into my car after school. \u201cAnd, what did you say to that?\u201d I asked. \u201cI said yeah-huh, that boys can marry boys and girls can marry girls.\u201d \u201cAnd, then what did she say?\u201d \u201cShe said that I was wrong and lying and that boys can\u2019t marry boys and if I kept saying that she was going to tell the teacher on me.\u201d The feisty part of me (which makes up about 80+ percent of my personality) wanted to get out of my car, find Marina and her mom in the parking lot and explain to them that boys can marry boys.\u00a0 Not in our state of course, but in some other states.\u00a0 And, it\u2019s not federally recognized.\u00a0 But still. Here\u2019s the thing. I feel like Marina wasn\u2019t spreading a message in support of marriage equality when she was informing who knows how many kindergartners that boys can\u2019t marry boys.\u00a0 I feel like she was saying that it\u2019s not right for boys to be in relationships with boys, period.\u00a0 The way C.J. relayed the conversation to me her tone was negative and antagonistic. How did the topic come up anyway? I reminded C.J. that we know lots of boys who are married to boys.\u00a0 I started naming off couples but was interrupted. \u201cOh, good, can you write those down so I can show Marina a list tomorrow?\u201d C.J. asked. Was I really going to draft a list of the married same-sex couples for C.J. to take to school to prove his point?\u00a0 No.\u00a0 Should I have? A few weeks ago, I overheard one of my friends on the phone and could tell that her son was having an issue at school. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you and get you all fired up\u2026.\u201d she trailed off. \u201cOh, well now you have to tell me!\u201d I said animatedly. \u201cAt school the other day, on the playground, a little boy told my son and some other kids that gay people get sick and die,\u201d she said. \u201cExcuse me?!?!\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t want to upset you.\u00a0 I\u2019m taking care of it,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cDid you talk to the principal?\u00a0 Do you want me to talk to the principal?\u00a0 I\u2019ll go right there right now and explain what is happening.\u00a0 What, is this first grader a medical expert who is commenting on AIDS?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all fine now,\u201d she assured me. \u201cDoes your son think that Uncle Uncle is going to get sick and die?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe may have, but I explained that that is not the truth,\u201d she said. Ugh!\u00a0 Where do these kids get these ideas?\u00a0 From their parents.\u00a0 And, why are they talking about such things on the playground?\u00a0 Because they know \u2013 starting in kindergarten and first grade \u2013 that the subjects are \u201codd\u201d and \u201cweird\u201d and \u201ctaboo\u201d and \u201ctitillating.\u201d But, to my kids, boys being married to boys are so commonplace that it doesn\u2019t warrant a second thought or consideration.\u00a0 It\u2019s as \u201cnormal\u201d as their dad and me being together. And, to my kids, gay people don\u2019t get sick and die.\u00a0 At a recent BBQ, after seeing his dad and me in swimsuits in the pool with a handful of gay men, C.J.\u2019s Brother actually pointed out that gay men tend to be in better shape and eat healthier food than we do.\u00a0 (I\u2019ll have you know that I cut back on carbs for a day to make myself feel better.) So, yes, I\u2019m easily excitable and, then, usually move on to a next thought just as easily.\u00a0 My next thought was\u2026what if years from now Marina wants to marry a girl?\u00a0 What if that little boy on the playground is gay, but doesn\u2019t want to get sick and die?\u00a0 By teaching their children these things, have the parents done them a service or disservice?\u00a0 Because, I don\u2019t know about that boy on the playground, but I do know that, should she choose to get married, Marina would make a beautiful bride no matter her partner.\u00a0 And, I hope her parents don\u2019t ruin that for her.
