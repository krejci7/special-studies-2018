A reader tipped me off to the Fraternal Birth Order Effect some time ago, but the name seemed daunting and, frankly, I\u2019ve been too tired for research and the new season of Project Runway is in full swing. But, on Friday night, while my husband was at work, in the quietness of the house after the boys\u2019 bedtime, I could hear Google calling.\u00a0 I stayed awake until midnight (that\u2019s 3 a.m. in Mom Time) reading everything that I could about the Fraternal Birth Order Effect.\u00a0  The Fraternal Birth Order Effect is proven to mean that for each older brother that a physical male has his chances of being homosexual increase by approximately 33 percent.\u00a0 According to several studies, the Fraternal Birth Order Effect is the strongest known predictor of sexual orientation.\u00a0 The same is not true for females.\u00a0 Have lots of older sisters?\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t increase your chances of being a lesbian.\u00a0 Sorry, this predictor of sexual orientation is for boys only. The Fraternal Birth Order Effect holds true for boys born from the same mother but not raised together.\u00a0 It does not hold true for boys adopted into the same family. \u00a0Therefore, it has an \u201cin-utero environmental causation.\u201d\u00a0 Which is a big fancy way to say it happens during pregnancy. After my Google fit, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about all of the boys I know who have multiple older brothers.\u00a0 I was counting little gay brothers to go to sleep.\u00a0 I thought of those shirts they sell that say \u201cI\u2019m the Big Brother\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m the Little Brother.\u201d\u00a0 The last-born son should have a shirt that reads \u201cI Have the Highest Chance of Being the Gay Brother.\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about families with lots of boys.\u00a0 The Beckhams.\u00a0 The Jonas Brothers.\u00a0 The Kennedys.\u00a0 The Marx Brothers.\u00a0 The Duggars.\u00a0 Oh no, not one of the 10 Duggar boys\u2026 It is hypothesized (look at me using big words!) that the Fraternal Birth Order Effect has \u201csomething to do with changes induced in the mother\u2019s body when gestating a boy that affects subsequent sons. \u201d (source: Wikipedia) \u201cThe theory suggests that mothers during childbirth may develop antibodies to proteins made by their firstborn son\u2019s Y chromosome, and subsequent pregnancies may stir up those antibodies in an immune reaction that affects the development of a male fetus.\u201d (source: San Francisco Chronicle) In the next decade or so, C.J. may need a shirt that reads \u201cI Was the Last Son in My Mom\u2019s Uterus and All I Got Was This Stupid Sexuality.\u201d \u00a0C.J.\u2019s Brother may very well have stolen the heterosexuality right out of my womb. Maybe heterosexuality proved no match for the kick ass antibodies my body created in response to carrying my first son.\u00a0 My antibodies should have capes and masks and patent leather, knee-high stiletto boots. I was proud of my antibodies for a minute, thinking that they were superheroes.\u00a0 Then, I thought, what if science learns to alter those antibodies so they decrease the likelihood of the Fraternal Birth Order Effect? Could women and doctors start messing with hormone injections during pregnancy to prevent homosexuality? Maybe, one day, when I have the courage and energy, I\u2019ll try giving that a Google. * * *  Are you a gay male?\u00a0 What is your birth order?\u00a0 What does your sibling lineup look like? Are you raising a gay male or gender nonconforming son?\u00a0 What is their birth order?\u00a0 What does their sibling lineup look like? C.J. is gender nonconforming, the second of two sons. \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 28 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
