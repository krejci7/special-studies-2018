For generations they have made their own clothes, quilts, costumes, pillows, tissue box covers, curtains, prom dresses, you name it. The talent was also passed on to my brother, Uncle Uncle, who once even sewed a bra \u2014 using no pattern \u2014 and filled it with pounds of bird seed to simulate the heft and sag of real breasts. Yes, my brother has mad sewing skills and heaving breasts, and I have neither. I have never been so thankful for Uncle Uncle\u2019s way with a sewing machine until he arrived at our house in the nick of time this weekend. Nana Grab Bags had just bought C.J. this washcloth. During the course of bathing with it he was struck by inspiration. He wanted it on a shirt. \u201cYou mean you want a Tiana shirt?,\u201d I asked. \u201cNo, I want this Tiana on a shirt,\u201d he replied, like he was speaking to a complete imbecile. \u201cYou want that washcloth on a shirt?\u201d \u201cYeeeeaaaaaaahhh,\u201d he said as his head weaved from left to right and right to left with massive amounts of attitude. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we have a shirt\u2026.\u201d \u201cI know which one!,\u201d he dashed off and returned with this shirt of his father\u2019s, which C.J. says is \u201csoft and wiggly,\u201d but not \u201cnice.\u201d I got my sewing machine out and stalled. And stalled. And stalled. And, then, Uncle Uncle arrived. After a serious talk about C.J.\u2019s design concept and a purple marker was used for added allure, the first piece of C.J.\u2019s Fall 2011 collection was complete. Thank you Uncle Uncle for understanding and supporting C.J. when the rest of us are a little slow. * * * In Monday\u2019s post (Which Way to Pre-K?) I asked if you thought that I should explain to C.J.\u2019s new Pre-K teacher that he is gender nonconforming or let her figure it out on her. Pretty much everybody thought that I should give her a heads up. That\u2019s what my gut was telling me, too. I\u2019ll have to let you know how that goes. Thanks for all of your comments and e-mails!   ", "feedtitle": "Page 28 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
