 C.J.’s Valentine’s Day themed, crafty, dress-up 6th birthday party — to which he wanted all of his friends to attend dressed as “rock-star sassy fairy ballerina Harajuku girls” — was a huge success!  We are still recovering so this post will be more photos and less words.  Enjoy! The Birthday Boy’s tiara…and some for his friends. C.J. and I made cupcakes for his guests. I usually pin crafts to my Pinterest board and never actually make them. Not this time! C.J. and I folded hearts using pages from the Pottery Barn Kids catalog and strung them together to make garland.  This photo doesn’t do our work justice.   The Birthday Boy’s outfit. He decided to ditch the leg warmers and opt for his silver heels over his purple bejeweled ballet flats. We hadn’t intended for jumping on the trampoline to be a part of the party, but it’s hard to resist a good bounce.   This was the first year that C.J. didn’t receive a single “boy toy.” He’s really digging the new La Dee Da dolls. His favorite gift of all…Uncle Uncle got a headband with a blonde braid attached, purchased extensions of real hair and hand sewed them onto the braided headband. C.J. can have long, blonde “girl hair” whenever he wants. The day after the party, C.J. bounced in his new dress that, according to him, makes him look like a teenager and his couture headband.
