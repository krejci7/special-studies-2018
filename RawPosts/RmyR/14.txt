Click here for all of the months\u2019 pictures, thoughts and happenings. If you\u2019re on Instagram, follow me. If you already follow me, thanks! \u201cThere\u2019s nothing negative about the way C.J. is. He\u2019s not dysphoric, searching for some answer. He\u2019s super happy just being himself. I told Lori we were going to raise C.J. the same way we raised Chase \u2014 instilling the same values and virtues \u2014 but that we would follow his lead and love him no matter what. I was like, \u2018If he loves Barbies, let\u2019s give him Barbies. If he loves wearing dresses, let\u2019s buy him dresses\u2019,\u201d Matt in an interview with MEL Magazine. Click here to read it. \u00a0 He had a bad day and needed to go for a walk \u201cto gather himself.\u201d I walked with him. Eventually he told me the top three things that were bothering him. 1. Someone ate the last of his Pringles. 2. He felt like he wasn\u2019t very helpful in the escape room we did. 3. He\u2019s sad that some parents don\u2019t love their kids anymore when they come out as LGBTQ. Those are some big problems for a 10 year old. And, that last one, is rough on a person no matter their age. When CJ told me one of the things bothering him (see previous pic/post) was that some parents reject their kids for being LGBTQ, this quote kept looping through my head. It\u2019s exactly how I feel about CJ, Chase and Matt. It\u2019s how every parent should feel about their LGBTQ child. And they should communicate it clearly in words and actions. Everyone should feel that a handful of people \u2014 or, at the very least, a parent \u2014 would choose them. \u00a0 Channel your inner CJ today. Say \u201cYaaaaas Qweeeeen\u201d when your boss asks you to do something. Say \u201cwater off a ducks back\u201d and flick your wrist and roll your eyes when someone says something rude to you. Eat ice cream for lunch and pickles for dinner. Create something fantastic. Be in bed with a good book by 9 pm. Live that CJ life. \u00a0 Another week of sewing camp all stitched up. \u201cMy teacher really had her hands full this week! There were so many girls who had never sewed before. This one girl kept saying her sewing machine was broken and I was all \u2018Gurl. You\u2019re machine is not broken. Here, let me thread it for you.\u2019 Then I helped every girl thread her machine. I\u2019m basically the teacher\u2019s aide and should get paid $10 for the week.\u201d \u00a0 Flashbacking to little CJ this Friday. He\u2019s werking and twerking on his first day of preschool. While I love the pose in this pic, I can only focus on his polo shirt\u2019s pink stripe. Why? Because he wanted a pink shirt from the girls section and I wouldn\u2019t buy it. He was four and I was struggling with his gender expression. I was afraid that the start of school would bring the start of bullying. So I forced him to focus on and get excited about the pink stripe on his polo shirt. Now, looking back from where I am today, I get mad at myself and feel bad for CJ when I look at this pic. He was four years old. It was the toughest age for a lot of reasons. The terrible twos are nothing. Nobody talks about the fucking fours. And, when CJ was four, we were at the height of our struggle with his gender identity and gender expression. Schools starting. If your boy wants a pink shirt, get it. Don\u2019t settle for a pink stripe. \u00a0 You\u2019re looking at proof that I\u2019m a good mom and my kids are reaching age appropriate milestones. CJ (age 10) can now flat iron my hair for me while I look at my phone. I\u2019ve dreamt of this day. I\u2019ve been waiting to write the date in his baby book. Today is the day. August 14, 2017. #neverforget #mommingsohard #momlife \u00a0 Backseat confessions on the way home from gymnastics practice. \u00a0 Matt: CJ, this is the church where your mom and I got married. Stand in front of it so I can send her a pic at work. \u00a0 Me from the Nordstrom shoe dept: Where are you? Matt: We are in the makeup department. A great guy saw CJ looking at the makeup and I told him that CJ is in to makeup and wants to be a makeup artist. He is giving CJ a free makeover. Upon seeing my third grade school picture\u2026 CJ: Mom! You were gender nonconforming, too?! Me: No. CJ: Then why are you wearing a tie? Me: Because it made me feel powerful. I wanted to be a successful businesswoman and that was my \u201cpower suit.\u201d When I wore that outfit I always got compliments. People said I looked smart and like a boss. Why? Because masculinity in females is seen as a strength. But, femininity in males is seen as a weakness. So, CJ doesn\u2019t get the same kind of praise when he wears a skirt\u2026.even though that\u2019s the clothing that makes him feel powerful. # # #   ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
