Us! At football games! I know, right?! We go to support our favorite player, Chase, who is now a football-playing high schooler*. There we sit in the stands \u2013 C.J. sandwiched between Matt and I. Matt is good at watching football. C.J. and I are not. Matt yell-cheers things like \u201cCome on D!\u201d and \u201cLook for the hole!\u201d while I laugh at the sexual undertones. Then, he tells me to grow up. I don\u2019t know what to yell-cheer. So mostly I don\u2019t. But every once in a while the urge comes over me. Like, when one of our players gets the ball and starts running for a touchdown. \u201cRUN!\u201d I yell-cheered when it happened at the last game. \u201cRUN! RUN! The player must have heard me yell-cheering because, sure as shit, he kept running. I saw a player from the other team getting dangerously close to him. \u201cDON\u2019T GET HURT!\u201d I yell-cheered even louder and with an extreme sense of urgency. Matt whipped his head in my direction. \u201cDid you really just yell that?\u201d he asked. \u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t want him to get hurt.\u201d Matt said that\u2019s not a good thing to yell-cheer during a football game. So I had to scratch that off my list of possible yell-cheers. Our player didn\u2019t get hurt. Instead, he got a touchdown and the stands went wild (as much as they do at freshman football games). \u201cDid we get a homerun?!\u201d C.J. asked. Matt put his head in his hands. C.J. will never remember that football has touchdowns and baseball has homeruns. C.J. fills some of his football spectating time reading People magazine because it arrives in the mail on Thursdays and Chase\u2019s games are on Thursdays \u2013 it\u2019s like it\u2019s meant to be. Last year, C.J.\u2019s teacher told him that he needs to read more nonfiction. People magazine is his preferred nonfiction reading material. I make him watch the game whenever Chase is playing. \u201cChase is going in,\u201d I say and nudge him. \u201cWhat number is he?\u201d he asks. \u201cNumber 59,\u201d I say. (Three minutes later.) \u201cChase is going in,\u201d I say and nudge him. \u201cWhat number is he?\u201d he asks. \u201cNumber 59,\u201d I say. That goes on all game long. Matt scoots a little further away from us. We\u2019ve been to about five games so far and I always manage to yell something that I guess I\u2019m not supposed to yell. Most recently it was \u201cRUN!!!\u201d followed by \u201cBE CAREFUL WITH HIS KNEES!! THEY DON\u2019T BEND THAT WAY!!!\u201d Then, a dad yell-cheered \u201cIF THE QUARTERBACK CANT THROW THE BALL PUT HIM IN A CHEERLEADER UNIFORM AND LET HIM CHEER ON THE SIDELINES WITH THE GIRLS!!!\u201d C.J. and I looked at Matt wide-eyed and horrified. \u201cOh, and he\u2019s allowed to yell that?!\u201d I asked. I try not to sit by that dad now. The first few games, C.J. would watch the cheerleaders flip and do acrobatics while saying under his breath \u201cI can do that\u201d and the ever-humble \u201cI can do that better.\u201d In true C.J.-style, he\u2019s made friends with a handful of the cheerleaders and is now convinced they are cheering specifically for his enjoyment. They call out for him by name when he arrives at the games (with the latest People Magazine and an iced tea in hand). He sits and smiles and waves at them as they do cheers and wiggles his body in a way that tells me he knows the cheer routines and is holding back from doing them along with the cheer team. I don\u2019t think he can hold back for much longer. When Chase first started playing football during summer break a co-worker asked me what position he plays and my response was \u201cwell\u2026he\u2019s not the runner or the thrower.\u201d I realized that I needed to learn more about Chase\u2019s new sport. Now, I know he plays defensive tackle and offensive tackle. C.J.\u2019s hobbies and passions are easy for me know about and be supportive of because they are typically things I was or am currently drawn to. I have to try a little harder with Chase. I like trying. Chase is a source of constant wonder for me. I\u2019ve never witnessed a cisgender straight boy grow into a man. He likes things that I know nothing about, which means I get to learn along with him or have him teach me. All while mothering him, guiding him and worrying about him every freaking minute of every damn day. \u201cDid you see that play?!\u201d Matt asks. \u201cNo, I told you, when Chase is playing I have to laser focus in on his head to watch for traumatic brain injuries,\u201d I say. Chase is still my little preemie baby, even though he\u2019s taller than me and my head rests on his shoulder when he hugs me. \u201cI like watching you play,\u201d I tell him. \u201cThanks, Ma. I like having you there,\u201d he says. If only he knew the embarrassing things I yell-cheer in the stands. *Sit down in advance if you are going to tell me how awful high school football is. It is one of the activities Chase wants to participate in and we support him in his passions the way we support C.J.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
