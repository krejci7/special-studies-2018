 Another gift from Nana Grab Bags for Easter?  A kite.  Simple enough, right?  Well, according to C.J. it is his “best gift forever.” Good picture, C.J.'s Mom! More impressive than that?  C.J. has found his calling his life.  He is a kite flying wunderkind.  As a kid, I could never get a kite to fly, the string became a knotted mess and I never, ever got liftoff.  C.J. did not get his kite flying skills from me.  Obviously.  At one point the kid was standing still and the kite was reaching high altitudes. Every day since Easter C.J. has flown his Little Mermaid kite.  Today, at the baseball fields C.J. ran back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, with kite overhead.  Two little girls asked each other why a…read the next word with a feeling of disgust…boy was flying an Ariel kite.  Another 4-year-old boy approached C.J. expressly to inform him that he does not like Ariel.  C.J. ignored everybody and flew his kite high.
