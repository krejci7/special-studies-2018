 When I was setting ground rules for this blog (yes, hello, there are ground rules), I decided to leave religion out of it.  It’s getting increasingly hard to follow that rule because of my own struggles and because about 50 percent of the e-mails that I receive mention religion and/or God in some way.  I’ve started to write a blog post about religion and may publish it in the coming weeks. Last week the following e-mail thudded into my inbox.  What’s your reaction to it?  What are your thoughts on homosexuality and religion? “CJ’ s mom If your child wanted to kill your pets would you be so happy about it? Or if your child got really happy trying to jump off a ladder or wanted to drive your car would you allow him to do this? For God sakes you so called mothers what the hell have you been brought up on. This is your child yet you have given up on them without even trying. This is so wrong. If you do not believe in the Bible then I guess there’s nothing to talk about but if you do, believe for your child because this is not what God intended for him. There a way too many scriptures that say this is wrong but it will be you who will have to stand before God about this. If the Bible said that being gay was okay, then I would be okay with it too but woman this is just wrong and I truly believe one day you will regret this mistake.” “Monica” is the charming woman who sent me this message.  When I tried to reply…..wouldn’t you know she gave a fake e-mail address?   What do you think of people who hide behind anonymity?
