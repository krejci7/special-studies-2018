Last week the following e-mail thudded into my inbox.\u00a0 What\u2019s your reaction to it?\u00a0 What are your thoughts on homosexuality and religion? \u201cCJ\u2019 s mom If your child wanted to kill your pets would you be so happy about it? Or if your child got really happy trying to jump off a ladder or wanted to drive your car would you allow him to do this? For God sakes you so called mothers what the hell have you been brought up on. This is your child yet you have given up on them without even trying. This is so wrong. If you do not believe in the Bible then I guess there\u2019s nothing to talk about but if you do, believe for your child because this is not what God intended for him. There a way too many scriptures that say this is wrong but it will be you who will have to stand before God about this. If the Bible said that being gay was okay, then I would be okay with it too but woman this is just wrong and I truly believe one day you will regret this mistake.\u201d \u201cMonica\u201d is the charming woman who sent me this message.\u00a0 When I tried to reply\u2026..wouldn\u2019t you know she gave a fake e-mail address?\u00a0\u00a0 What do you think of people who hide behind anonymity?
