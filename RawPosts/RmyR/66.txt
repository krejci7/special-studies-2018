I recently ran across Emily Perl Kingsley\u2019s essay titled \u201cWelcome to Holland\u201d and it describes my parenting experience perfectly. I am not raising a child with a disability (like Kingsley is/was), but my child does have unique needs and his life \u2014 our life \u2014 looks much different than what I envisioned when the ultrasound technician told me that he was boy. I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world, but it took me some time to adjust. WELCOME TO HOLLAND by\u2028 Emily Perl Kingsley I am often asked to describe the experience of raising a child with a disability \u2013 to try to help people who have not shared that unique experience to understand it, to imagine how it would feel. It\u2019s like this\u2026 When you\u2019re going to have a baby, it\u2019s like planning a fabulous vacation trip \u2013 to Italy. You buy a bunch of guide books and make your wonderful plans. The Coliseum. The Michelangelo David. The gondolas in Venice. You may learn some handy phrases in Italian. It\u2019s all very exciting. After months of eager anticipation, the day finally arrives. You pack your bags and off you go. Several hours later, the plane lands. The stewardess comes in and says, \u201cWelcome to Holland.\u201d \u201cHolland?!?\u201d you say. \u201cWhat do you mean Holland?? I signed up for Italy! I\u2019m supposed to be in Italy. All my life I\u2019ve dreamed of going to Italy.\u201d But there\u2019s been a change in the flight plan. They\u2019ve landed in Holland and there you must stay. The important thing is that they haven\u2019t taken you to a horrible, disgusting, filthy place, full of pestilence, famine and disease. It\u2019s just a different place. So you must go out and buy new guide books. And you must learn a whole new language. And you will meet a whole new group of people you would never have met. It\u2019s just a different place. It\u2019s slower-paced than Italy, less flashy than Italy. But after you\u2019ve been there for a while and you catch your breath, you look around\u2026. and you begin to notice that Holland has windmills\u2026.and Holland has tulips. Holland even has Rembrandts. But everyone you know is busy coming and going from Italy\u2026 and they\u2019re all bragging about what a wonderful time they had there. And for the rest of your life, you will say \u201cYes, that\u2019s where I was supposed to go. That\u2019s what I had planned.\u201d And the pain of that will never, ever, ever, ever go away\u2026 because the loss of that dream is a very very significant loss. But\u2026 if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn\u2019t get to Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely things \u2026 about Holland.
