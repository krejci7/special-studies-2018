So, he taught C.J. how to take his own videos using the iPad.\u00a0 C.J. proceeded to take\u00a081 minutes\u00a0of footage of himself playing with his dolls.\u00a0 He might have taken more, but, alas, there was not enough free space on the iPad.\u00a0 I found the many clips last night and have compiled a few snippets so that you can get a little taste of the real C.J.  Now, you have learned some of his\u00a0favorite catchphrases that I hear every day, like:  Holy ja-moly! Oh, snap! Cray-cray!\u00a0 (Everybody and everything are always cray-cray) By the way\u2026 You can\u2019t get enough of me! I\u2019m resistible!\u00a0 (Which actually means \u201cI\u2019m irresistible!\u201d) I need my place to shine! I\u2019m shopping my butt off! I did not sign up for this! I\u2019m on fire! I quit!  You\u2019ve probably also noticed that C.J. likes to make up his own jokes and may be overly\u00a0concerned about hair and shoes. \u00a0But, I mean, can you blame him?
