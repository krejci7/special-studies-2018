I started this blog to connect with other families raising slightly effeminate, possibly gay sons and to get advice from LGBTQ teens, adults and their parents about raising the next generation of the community.\u00a0 The first thing I learned from my readers is that my son\u2019s effeminacy isn\u2019t about his sexuality \u2014 it\u2019s about his gender.\u00a0 If I had never started the blog I might still be trying to figure out that and so many other things. I\u2019ve felt a lot of anxiety during these three years.\u00a0 Risk has always been a negative four-letter word for me and all of this has felt risky: starting a blog; sharing a part of our family with who knows who; admitting that my son plays with \u201cgirl things\u201d and \u201cwears girl clothes\u201d and that, at times, it made me feel uncomfortable; speaking out; writing a book; outing my family; learning to live without being ruled by fear; and beginning to advocate openly. It would have been so much easier to spend the last three years working my day job, running the home, caring for my kids, shopping online, perusing the boredom trifecta of Facebook/Instagram/Pinterest; and learning new skills, like knitting or how to cook rice without a rice cooker.\u00a0 But, none of that would have helped me grow up and grow as a person as much as this blog, book and raising a child with unique needs have. I wouldn\u2019t change a thing about my life, my path, my family, my friends or the last three years.\u00a0 It\u2019s been amazing and I\u2019ve been blessed. Four months ago, on the morning of September 3, I got out of bed, put on my new blue dress and tried to use hair and makeup, smoke and mirrors and compression undergarments to disguise the fact that I hadn\u2019t been sleeping well and had been eating my feelings for weeks. \u00a0I was preparing myself to be \u2014 the moment the cameras started rolling with me on the couch of The TODAY Show \u2013 to be the most hated woman and mother in America.\u00a0 It was a risk I was willing to take.\u00a0 Wholeheartedly. I\u2019d been watching for years as very vocal members of the public and media bashed, threatened and harassed moms like me; moms who are open about and unashamed of having a child who is differently-gendered and/or openly homosexual. \u00a0And, I was next, I thought.\u00a0 I mean, I had taken some heat, but nothing compared to that felt by others. Matt and I did our interview on The TODAY Show and no sooner were we off the couch than I received my first hate email resulting from the appearance.\u00a0 \u201cHere it goes,\u201d I thought to myself.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Then came the emails of support and cries for help.\u00a0 Before the end of the day, I had more than 300 emails.\u00a0 And, as it has been since I started my blog, for every email of hate, I received dozens of emails from people who were glad they had found my blog and book. I wasn\u2019t hated, no, more than that, I was feeling the love.\u00a0 And, by revealing our identities, we had done a lot to quiet two large groups of our haters.\u00a0 Those who believed for years that my blog and family are works of fiction.\u00a0 We aren\u2019t and we proved that when people got to see us in the flesh.\u00a0 Look!\u00a0 We\u2019re real!\u00a0 We live and breathe! And, for years I had people ask\u00a0 \u201cwhere is this kid\u2019s father?!\u201d \u00a0He\u2019s right here, right beside on The TODAY Show couch, at most of my appearances, being quoted in interviews and writing a kickass piece for The Atlantic in which he clarified, \u201cMy son skipping and twirling in a dress isn\u2019t a sign that a strong male figure is missing from his life, to me it\u2019s a sign that a strong male figure is fully vested in his life and committed to protecting him and allowing him to grow into the person who he was created to be.\u201d I\u2019ve gotten really good at ignoring negativity.\u00a0 And, there\u2019s still a lot of it out there. Do I read the comments made in response to what I write?\u00a0 Comments made on this blog?\u00a0 Yes, every single one.\u00a0 Comments made on other websites where my essays are posted.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 I can\u2019t.\u00a0 It\u2019s not healthy for me.\u00a0 And, I don\u2019t publish the few, random negative comments that people attempt to make on my blog.\u00a0 I used to feel bad trashing the negative comments on my blog, like I wasn\u2019t being honest or fair or giving everyone a voice or showing both sides of the story.\u00a0 But, you know what?\u00a0 It\u2019s my blog.\u00a0 Everyone has a voice.\u00a0 I have one here.\u00a0 If haters want to be heard, they can start their own blog for me to not read. This is the year when I realized that I\u2019ve grown up a ton since the start of all this.\u00a0 At 36, I finally feel like a full-fledged grown up. \u00a0I want to do something with my life when and where I can. \u00a0At last, I proudly, comfortably, fell like an adult and, I feel like raising a child like C.J., writing this blog, my book and advocating are the main reasons why. When I first started writing, I would be experiencing something in life and think \u201ca blog post is happening right now.\u201d\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t happen as often any more.\u00a0 I have to be thankful for it, because it means that we are so totally comfortable with C.J.\u2019s gender nonconformity that it doesn\u2019t steal the spotlight, it isn\u2019t a focal point, it doesn\u2019t call out to get our attention and make us feel uncomfortable, worried, anxious or hope that others aren\u2019t looking.\u00a0 It\u2019s just a part of him.\u00a0 We have come to a place of total acceptance.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve been reading my blog for long, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed it. My writing style has changed, I\u2019ve stopped using wit and sass to deal with my uneasy feelings about the many facets of his gender creativeness and I\u2019ve just started being really, really honest about my feelings. \u00a0I\u2019ve become more sincere.\u00a0 Allowing C.J. to be 100 percent C.J., helped me to be 100 percent me. With the publication of my book and coming out, I feel like I\u2019ve aligned and merged the two lives I felt I was living.\u00a0 There was blog life and real life.\u00a0 Now there is just one life.\u00a0 It\u2019s easier that way, isn\u2019t it? What\u2019s next?\u00a0 This.\u00a0 This blog.\u00a0 This life.\u00a0 This family.\u00a0 And you, I hope.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
