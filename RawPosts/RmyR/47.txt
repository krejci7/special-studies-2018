All of those things made him a target for bullying, harassment, victimization and violence. I saw him find his people and it eased my worry. The first time he took me to a gay club, I remember thinking, \u201cHe\u2019s found his people. He\u2019s safe here.\u201d The first time I visited his new place in West Hollywood, I remember thinking, \u201cHe\u2019s found his people. He\u2019s safe here.\u201d My youngest son started showing signs of gender nonconformity at age three, started describing himself as gender nonconforming at five, self identified as a member of the LGBTQ community at eight. Little did I know that the worry I\u2019ve always had for my LGBTQ brother\u2019s safety had a long lost twin \u2013 it\u2019s the worry I have for my LGBTQ son\u2019s safety. \u201cHe just needs to find his people, then he\u2019ll be safe. He just needs to find his people, then he\u2019ll be safe,\u201d I say over and over again to soothe myself, feel hopeful and remind myself that it gets better. I worry daily about the boys in the bathroom who try to see my son\u2019s genitals to determine if he\u2019s a boy or girl; the kids who tease him for reading The Babysitters Club books; the boys who tell him he shouldn\u2019t wear his hair in a ponytail because ponytails are for girls; and the classmates who aren\u2019t amused by his constant accessorizing with jewelry. On days when my worry runs high, I fantasize about the day when he finds his people. I daydream about taking him to his first gay club. I want to open the doors and walk in first, turnaround and see his face as he takes it all in and realizes that he has \u2013 finally \u2013 found his people. Standing in that gay club, staring at my rainbow boy, I\u2019d think to myself, \u201cYou\u2019ve found your people. You\u2019re safe here.\u201d I awoke this morning to news of the shooting in Orlando. The deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. At an LGBTQ nightclub. The shooter was angry because a couple of months ago he saw two gay men kissing. At least 50 people are dead and at least 53 more are injured. My brother is not safe. My son is not safe. Even if they find their people. Because monsters can find them there, too. My son asked what happened in Orlando because he heard mention of it several times on the news this morning. I had to tell him that a man went into a gay club and killed and shot the people inside. \u201cWhy?\u201d my son asked. \u201cBecause he didn\u2019t like the people inside,\u201d I answered. \u201cThat\u2019s awful? People can just do that?\u201d my son asked with fear in his eyes. I wanted to say no, that people couldn\u2019t just do that. But, the truth is, they can. And I always try to give my kids the truth. \u201cBut, we\u2019re okay,\u201d I said. \u201cThat happened all the way on the other side of the United States.\u201d To my son that\u2019s a world away. To me it\u2019s down the street. Today, as I snuggled with my son watching RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, took him to Target to spend his money on a new doll and, now, as I watch him flip and dance on the trampoline, I\u2019m near tears. I can\u2019t keep him safe. His people can\u2019t keep him safe. The only thing that could make his life a little safer is being cisgender and straight. Being the complete opposite of who he naturally is would keep him safe. As a mother, I\u2019d rather my son be his happy, rainbow self and be unsafe, than miserably pretend to be somebody he\u2019s not and have a better chance of survival. It\u2019s hard to admit that. \u201cHe just needs to find his people, then he\u2019ll be safe,\u201d I continue to think to myself. My worry remains, but so does my hope.
