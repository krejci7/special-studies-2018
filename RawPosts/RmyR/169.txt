July 12 through 14, I will be in Berkeley, California, at the 2013 Gender Spectrum Conference, where I will participate on the following panel: Parent Empowerment Panel: Working with Schools in Service of My Gender Diverse Student Increasingly, children and teens are attending schools and maintaining their gender independent expression and/or identities. In the process, they are often pushing up against schools and systems not necessarily prepared to support them, requiring caregivers to advocate on their child\u2019s behalf. This panel session will include various individuals who have worked with their schools (often collaboratively but sometimes in the face of strong resistance) to ensure their child\u2019s safety and well-being. As families share their stories, participants will hear various lessons learned and strategies implemented for effectively engaging schools to take the necessary steps to meet the needs of gender diverse students. The deadline to register for the 2013 Gender Spectrum Conference is July 8.\u00a0 And, there will be onsite registration at the event. I will be blogging, Facebooking and tweeting live from the conference.\u00a0 So if you can\u2019t attend, follow me as I learn and grow.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never been to the Gender Spectrum Conference but have heard such great things about it.\u00a0 I can\u2019t wait to dive in and share my experiences with you. Next up after Gender Spectrum is BlogHer 2013.\u00a0 This year, the largest conference for women bloggers (men attend to!) will be held July 25 through 27 in Chicago.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be speaking on the following panel: Politics & Activism Roundtable: What You Learn When You Speak Out A series of poignant vignettes from BlogHer community members who have suddenly been thrust into the most unimaginable situations. How they coped, and what they learned about online community and advocacy. Presenters: Adria Richards, C.J.\u2019s Mom, and Mir Kamin I\u2019m also incredibly honored to be one of BlogHer\u2019s 2013 Voices Of The Year. Six weeks + 2,600 submissions + 15 committee members = The 2013 BlogHer Voices of the Year! (Affectionately known as #VOTY.) This year\u2019s VOTY submission process has been a magnificent journey through the hearts and minds of the blogosphere. We are so excited to honor these 100 bloggers \u2014 writers, speakers, and artists, who have pushed us to think more, feel more, share more, and do more. They specifically recognized my \u201cMy Son\u2019s Christmas Dress\u201d post from the holiday season. Because I am a speaker at BlogHer \u201913, my family, friends and fans can get 20 percent off of the conference registration fee.\u00a0 Here\u2019s the registration link\u00a0and\u00a0 promo code (BH13SPKR) in case you are interested.
