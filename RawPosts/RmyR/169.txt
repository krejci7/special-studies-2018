I feel the need to point out that Nikki is adopted, only because I\u2019ve noticed and noted that 75 percent of the families who have contacted me looking for camaraderie, resources, advice, etc. are raising a gender nonconforming child that is not biologically theirs. I wrote about it back in February. * * * Speaking of parents/caregivers contacting me for help, I have two parents looking to connect with other families in their area who are also raising gender nonconforming boys. If there is a gender nonconforming boy in your life who is looking to playdate and you live in Boston or the New Jersey/Philadelphia area please let me know and I\u2019ll make the e-introduction. * * * If you live in the Seattle area, click here for a list of Gender Diversity resources that one of my readers recently sent to me. Gender Diversity provides services and support that help families understand the wide range of naturally occurring gender identities and expressions that exist. Their monthly support groups for parents and guardians of gender nonconforming and transgender children began in 2008, making it one of the longest running and largest network of support groups in the country. Their groups meet at Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, the Polyclinic Madison Center, and a number of other locations throughout the greater Puget Sound area. They have support groups for families with kids ages 11 and under and 12 to 20; fathers only groups; kids play groups and more.\u00a0 I wish we had this in Orange County, California! * * * I have a reader (location unknown) who is looking for resources specifically for parents/caregivers raising gender nonconforming girls.\u00a0 Blogs?\u00a0 Websites?\u00a0 Groups?\u00a0 Anything?\u00a0 Send me suggestions if you have any. * * * And, finally, for pride season, FarFaria (a subscription-based children\u2019s storybook app for the iPad) is releasing four awesome books. FarFaria has always published stories with characters of diverse backgrounds. These stories encourage acceptance of and kindness towards others as a family value. To help parents strengthen this value in their family FarFaria is releasing four new stories in June. Stories like \u201cPatrick\u2019s Pride\u201d (June 6), \u201cHenry the Venus Flytrap\u201d (June 12), \u201cThe Boy with the Pink Socks\u201d (June 20) and \u201cKindness Grows\u201d (June 25) encourage values of acceptance and appreciation of diversity in young readers. C.J. especially likes Patrick\u2019s Pride, which features a lion cub with two moms.\u00a0 Check it out!   ", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
