Here is C.J. in his all-time favorite shirt, which is by Handsome In Pink.\u00a0 It\u2019s a purple number with a pink dirt bike on the front.\u00a0 I also like the \u201cHandsome In Pink\u201d printed on the back.\u00a0  The amazing gals at Handsome In Pink have been kind enough to offer up an item for giveaway to one Raising My Rainbow reader.\u00a0 Lucky you\u2026maybe.\u00a0 And, now, a word from our sponsors\u2026 \u201cHandsome in Pink is a groovy Oakland, Calif., clothing line that started in 2007. Our mission has always been to empower people (babies, kids, & adults) by undressing stereotypes and offering clothes that actually reflect who we are and what we like to do. We believe that colors (such as pink and purple) and active imagery (such as fire trucks, tool belts, and electric guitars) belong to everyone and should be mingling, not dividing up along gender lines. The way we see it, there should be more sharing of clothes amongst girls and boys.\u201d To enter this giveaway, go to their website at www.HandsomeInPink.com and, then, leave a comment at the bottom of this post telling me what item you would want if you won.\u00a0 A winner will be selected randomly by C.J. and announced next Thursday.
