 If C.J. were Oprah and this were his favorite things episode he would give all of you clothes from Handsome In Pink.  But, C.J. isn’t Oprah and he only has one item to giveaway, so you are all going to have to fight for it like Jerry Springer’s audience. Here is C.J. in his all-time favorite shirt, which is by Handsome In Pink.  It’s a purple number with a pink dirt bike on the front.  I also like the “Handsome In Pink” printed on the back.   The amazing gals at Handsome In Pink have been kind enough to offer up an item for giveaway to one Raising My Rainbow reader.  Lucky you…maybe.  And, now, a word from our sponsors… “Handsome in Pink is a groovy Oakland, Calif., clothing line that started in 2007. Our mission has always been to empower people (babies, kids, & adults) by undressing stereotypes and offering clothes that actually reflect who we are and what we like to do. We believe that colors (such as pink and purple) and active imagery (such as fire trucks, tool belts, and electric guitars) belong to everyone and should be mingling, not dividing up along gender lines. The way we see it, there should be more sharing of clothes amongst girls and boys.” To enter this giveaway, go to their website at www.HandsomeInPink.com and, then, leave a comment at the bottom of this post telling me what item you would want if you won.  A winner will be selected randomly by C.J. and announced next Thursday.
