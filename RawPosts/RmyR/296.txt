 I’m reading the It Gets Better book and it has turned me into a rapid-cycling bipolar.  One minute I’m happy and thankful that Dan Savage and Terry Miller had the vision and dedication to make their It Gets Better Project an amazing reality.  The next minute I’m terribly sad and depressed because it shouldn’t have to get better.  It should already be better.  It shouldn’t have to get so bad that kids need to be reminded that it gets better.  I never want my son to feel hopeless.  I never want to be a mother who finds her son dead from a bullying-induced suicide. If you are reading this and you don’t know what the It Gets Better project is, you should. Check it out at ItGetsBetter.org. RaisingMyRainbow reader and It Gets Better contributor Patrick Murphy is a total superstar and sent me a copy of the It Gets Better book to give away to one of my readers.  To enter the giveaway, simply comment on this post.  C.J. will pick a winner next week (which should be interesting), so check back next Thursday to see if you won. If you know of an LGBT teen or have a sneaking suspicion about a certain someone, they need this book.  Their family needs this book.  The local schools and libraries need this book. Buy it from Penguin.com or Amazon.com. You can donate a copy to your local school or library by clicking here. Can’t read?  Get the audiobook here. Can’t read OR hear?  That really sucks.  I’m sorry.
