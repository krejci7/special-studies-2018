If you are reading this and you don\u2019t know what the It Gets Better project is, you should. Check it out at ItGetsBetter.org. RaisingMyRainbow reader and It Gets Better contributor Patrick Murphy is a total superstar and sent me a copy of the It Gets Better book to give away to one of my readers.\u00a0 To enter the giveaway, simply comment on this post.\u00a0 C.J. will pick a winner next week (which should be interesting), so check back next Thursday to see if you won.
