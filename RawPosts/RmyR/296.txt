Well, along came a super-cheap weekend getaway package to Palm Desert and we packed our bags quicker than you can say over-chlorinated public pool with rats in the palm trees.\u00a0 Fairfield Inn by Marriot.\u00a0 Whoop, whoop! You may also know it, as C.J. does, as the place with two beds.\u00a0 Four years of life and never slept in a hotel room with two queen size beds.\u00a0 It blew his mind, really, and we had to allow a good 30 minutes for him to jump from one bed to the other and back again and again and again.\u00a0 While he did that, C.J.\u2019s brother opened and closed the pimping mini-fridge and put my half-full Vitamin Water on the top shelf, then the bottom shelf, then in the door shelf.\u00a0 You\u2019d of thought it was Christmas morning. And, then we were off!\u00a0 A short driving tour of neighboring Palm Springs and C.J. discovered a city after his own heart. \u201cLOOK AT THE RAINBOW FLAG!\u201d he yelled as he hyper-ventilated. \u201cANOTHER ONE!\u201d he gasped. \u201cTHERE\u2019S ANOTHER ONE!\u201d his face turning purple. \u201cDid you teach him that?\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad asked me. \u201cHow would I teach him that?\u201d I replied.\u00a0 \u201cThey don\u2019t exactly let the rainbow flags fly free in the O.C.\u201d \u201cI just find it weird that of all the things to see in a new city, that is what he picks up on.\u00a0 What are the chances?\u201d he said, giving me a doubting look. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s like me being drawn to and liking the Tiffany-green Tiffany & Co. box upon first sight, without even knowing what it stood for.\u00a0 Some passions you just know and feel in your soul,\u201d I reasoned.\u00a0 My husband dropped the subject, as he usually does when I mention Tiffany & Co. In answer to your question, yes, as a matter fact, there was a continental breakfast.\u00a0 C.J. enjoyed a pink breakfast of waffles with strawberries on top and strawberry yogurt. To my boys, nothing compares to continental breakfast.\u00a0 Nothing. We ventured to the Living Desert, which was ah-mazing.\u00a0 C.J.\u2019s Dad paid for the VIP shuttle and we rode around in a golf cart while C.J. waved to other visitors like he was Kate Middleton on her wedding day.\u00a0 Later that day, we took the kids to the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway.\u00a0 They were so excited; C.J.\u2019s brother for the right reasons, C.J. for the wrong reasons. You see, C.J. thought that we said Ariel Tramway, not Aerial Tramway.\u00a0 He thought that he was going to see Ariel (a.k.a The Little Mermaid).\u00a0 He looked all over for her, bless his heart, but couldn\u2019t find her.\u00a0 And, he started crying the saddest quiet tears.\u00a0 What would have been more perfect than a pink breakfast, rainbow flags and The Little Mermaid? He cheered up as the tram ascended the mountain.\u00a0 Or so I\u2019m told, since I didn\u2019t go on the tram. You see, I don\u2019t do well with closed spaces, heights, being at the mercy of someone else and my ears popping due to altitude.\u00a0 Oh, you have your hang-ups too, so please don\u2019t judge.\u00a0 And, yes, I did consider taking a klonopin just to get myself up the damn mountain and experience it with my family, but that would have meant no margarita at Los Casuelas with dinner, so I let it be a cool \u201cboys-only adventure.\u201d After dinner C.J. got the souvenir that has not left his head since our return to reality.\u00a0 A fuzzy Viking hat with long blonde braids attached.\u00a0 He takes the braids out, puts them in ponytails, wants braids again, flips the hair over his shoulder like Cher. \u201cI like my city,\u201d C.J. said as we loaded into the car and started driving home on Sunday. \u201cA RAINBOW FLAG!\u201d he yelled and pointed as we drove away from Palm Springs. \u201cANOTHER ONE!\u201d he screeched in delight, over and over again, until there were none.
