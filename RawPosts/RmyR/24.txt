 Last week, C.J. shared his ideas for the hotel resort he wants to open when he grows up and he asked you to submit name suggestions because he was struggling to find the perfect name. He went through all of your suggestions (more than 100!) repeatedly on Saturday. He made a short list of his four favorite names and carried it in his pocket on Sunday. The final four:  AmazingNest CAYA (Come As You Are) Inn of the Rainbow Pride Palace  Last night he finally decided on a name. Pride Palace! After reading through all of the comments, C.J. would like you to know that his hotel resort will have plenty of vegetarian and vegan meal options, the staff will know sign language and there will be a small library filled with books. There will be cabins and cottages for guests who want less of a hotel resort feel. He is super excited to announce that the hotel resort will also host weddings! He’s giddy that so many people want to stay at his hotel resort and that he already has legal and interior design professionals who have offered to lend an expert helping hand. Thank you all for supporting and encourage my rainbow boy. Xoxo, Lori P.S. Michelle! You won the naming game. Your prize package (a tiny paper airplane, two tiny origami figures, a friendship bracelet and a note) will be headed your way shortly.
