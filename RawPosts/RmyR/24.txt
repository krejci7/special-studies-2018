Can you believe he\u2019s already 14?! Any-who, following are the highlights from our month on Instagram. Click here to view more. If you\u2019re on Instagram, follow me. If you already follow me, thank you! I\u2019m beyond honored to again be named one of BlogHer\u2019s Voices of the Year. BlogHer is the largest annual celebration of women online content creators, social media influencers and media makers. I\u2019ve been named a BlogHer 2017 Voice of the Year in the Short Written Work category for the blog post I published the day after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. Growing up, I instinctively knew that I had to worry about my brother\u2019s safety because he was slightly effeminate when young, people assumed he was gay as a teen, then he came out shortly after high school. All of those things made him a target for bullying, harassment, victimization and violence. I saw him find his people and it eased my worry. The first time he took me to a gay club, I remember thinking, \u201cHe\u2019s found his people. He\u2019s safe here.\u201d When I awoke to news of the shooting in Orlando, I was reminded that my brother is not safe. My son is not safe. Even if they find their people. Because monsters can find them there, too. \u00a0 About a year ago, I dropped CJ off at a girlfriend\u2019s birthday party. An art teacher helped the girls and CJ through a painting class and, then, they enjoyed cupcakes and gift opening. When I returned to pick up CJ, everyone\u2019s paintings were lined up for viewing and admiration. Everyone had followed the teacher\u2019s step-by-step instructions and pained two pink French poodles on either side of the Eiffel Tower. Everyone except CJ. He painted this. Because he can never be the same as everyone else. This painting has been hanging in his bedroom ever since. #nobodyisperfect \u00a0 My son or a resident of Grey Gardens? \u00a0 We took some time off to get away for Spring Break and are just now getting back to our normal routine. Which sucks, but what are you going to do? It can\u2019t be Spring Break forever. CJ used his time on the plane to finish the book Courage to Soar by Simone Biles. He was so inspired that he made me spend the rest of the flight taking pictures of his Barbie doing plane gymnastics. Which means I didn\u2019t get to finish my book. But that\u2019s okay because mothering is all about sacrifices. \u00a0 When I tell other guys and dads that my son is gender nonconforming and possibly transgender and/or gay, the response I get most often is \u201cMan, how do you deal with that? I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d What does that mean? You couldn\u2019t parent a kid like mine? You\u2019d be his first bully and \u201cmake him a man?\u201d To me, that makes you less of a man. Much of the time when I confront such people they immediately begin to backpedal and try to move on. I\u2019m not afraid of this discussion and many don\u2019t choose to argue with me or defend their position. To me, loving a child who is different, a target and seen as vulnerable is my role as a father and decent human being. He\u2019s just as special to me and loved by me as my oldest son, whose most prized possession is a pocketknife, who plays football, likes fart jokes, and is starting to notice girls. I want to love my son, not change him. I\u2019m a father. I signed on for the job with no strings attached, no caveats, no conditions. \u2013 Matt, in a piece he wrote for The Atlantic a while back.  \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
