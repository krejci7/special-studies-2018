I played the part of Sears\u2019s photographer, too.\u00a0 The picture is still in my mind. One big happy family.\u00a0 Poor Aaron.\u00a0 I thought of him one morning last week.\u00a0 I was tying C.J.\u2019s shoes and noticed that he had been quiet while getting dressed for school.\u00a0 C.J. is never quiet while getting dressed; after all, he has big opinions about what he should and shouldn\u2019t wear. \u201cMommy, today when we get to school, can you tell Gigi that I don\u2019t wanna be the Daddy all the time?\u00a0 Sometimes I want to be the Mommy.\u201d \u201cWhat?,\u201d I asked, a little confused. \u201cWhen we play house at\u00a0free time she always makes me be the Daddy and sometimes I wanna be the Mommy.\u201d I stared at C.J. as numerous thoughts ran through my mind:  \u00a0The NERVE of some little girl telling my son that he can\u2019t be a Mommy! Well, at this point it really isn\u2019t possible for him to be the Mommy. What does it matter to Gigi if C.J. wants to be the Mommy, she really is a bossy little thing. Maybe C.J. needs to learn that he does have to be the Daddy because he is the boy and boys are Daddies. How would Gigi\u2019s parents feel about me and my son teaching her a thing or two about gender and identity? Maybe C.J. can be the primary caregiver \u201cDaddy\u201d while the \u201cPapa\u201d is working the 9-to-5 at some hip ad agency or modern design firm.\u00a0 Or, maybe the \u201cPapa\u201d to C.J.\u2019s \u201cDaddy\u201d would be a lawyer or doctor.  C.J. has a group of four or five girls he hangs out with consistently at school.\u00a0 Occasionally another little red-headed boy will join the mix.\u00a0 At free time they like to play house and C.J. is always relegated to the role of Daddy.\u00a0 This, to most, would be the obvious and only choice for him, unless he wanted to be the baby, but he is way too type A for that. We were walking up to his classroom and he started crying, which he has never \u2013 in his illustrious, two-year academic career \u2013 done.\u00a0 They were slow, silent tears, but they were there.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked as I knelt down to his level. \u201cWill you talk to Gigi?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Ms. Sensible and I\u2019ll help you, okay,\u201d I said. His peers filed into the classroom and we hung out on the sidelines.\u00a0 Ms. Sensible could see that C.J. had been crying. \u201cWe\u2019re having a rough morning.\u00a0 Do you have a minute?\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d she said I explained the situation to Ms. Sensible. I explained that, sometimes, my son wants to be a Mommy, not a Daddy, and the girls in the class won\u2019t let him.\u00a0 I explained that I understood both sides. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to handle this.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never done this before,\u201d I admitted to her. \u201cMe neither,\u201d she said to me and we stood quietly. \u201cI\u2019m going to email his therapist and see what she says,\u201d I said. \u201cYeah, do that and let me know what she suggests,\u201d Ms. Sensible said.\u00a0 \u201cFor today, I\u2019ll keep an eye on the situation.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d C.J. looked at us with hope in his eyes.\u00a0 Today, he might get to be a Mommy. I emailed C.J.\u2019s therapist.\u00a0 She\u2019s amazing.\u00a0 She\u2019s cute, hip, sweet and spunky.\u00a0 I think she\u2019s my age.\u00a0 If she weren\u2019t my son\u2019s therapist and there wasn\u2019t the whole doctor/patient thing going on, I think we could hang out and have fun.\u00a0 We would get a mani-pedi while reading gossip magazines and, then, sneak off for a Starbucks and some chocolate.\u00a0 Or, maybe we would meet up for dinner and each say \u201cyeah, I could do a glass of wine\u201d and that glass of wine would turn into two and a half glasses each and we would end up in Nordstrom trying on perfume and giggling uncontrollably at something that amused no one else in the entire store.\u00a0 Maybe we would go to a farmer\u2019s market. But, alas, in the real world, I only see her once a month when C.J. has an appointment.\u00a0 She specializes in gender issues, parenting and children.\u00a0 So, she\u2019s a perfect fit for us and well worth the hour and a half drive each way. Anyway, I emailed C.J.\u2019s therapist and she immediately proved why we adore her.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how she got so smart, but I\u2019m glad she did. She said that we should step back and look at the bigger picture.\u00a0 \u201cC.J.\u2019s friends won\u2019t let him ___________ and it hurts him badly enough that he cries about it.\u201d\u00a0 She told me to encourage C.J. to use his words to express himself to his friends, tell them that they are hurting his feelings and ask them to stop the action that is hurting his feelings. Simple enough, right? We practiced at home. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna always be the Daddy, I wanna be the Mommy sometimes, too.\u00a0 It\u2019s not fair that I always have to be the Daddy,\u201d C.J. told me he was going to say to his girl friends. I picked C.J. up from school. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?,\u201d I asked him. \u201cGigi said no.\u00a0 I can\u2019t be the Mommy.\u00a0 I always have\u2019ta be the Daddy.\u201d I listened and observed.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t seem that upset.\u00a0 The next step is for Ms. Sensible to talk with the girls to discuss the importance of taking everyone\u2019s feelings and opinions into consideration.\u00a0 It\u2019s more a lesson in empathy than gender.\u00a0 We can all use a lesson on empathy every now and then.\u00a0 I thought about looking Aaron up on Facebook to possibly apologize for not asking him if he wanted to be the Mommy, instead of the Daddy.\u00a0 I don\u2019t remember his last name.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s for the best.\u00a0 But, Aaron, if you are reading this, I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0 I never thought to ask if you wanted to be the Mommy.
