(and me).\u00a0 There are a lot of new things.\u00a0 New routines.\u00a0 New classroom.\u00a0 New teacher.\u00a0 New classmates. We\u2019ve found that he self-edits more than ever in the first weeks of school.\u00a0 He tries not to stand out as he gets his bearings.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t wear his socks from the \u201cpink section.\u201d\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t wear his jewelry and accessories.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t take his pink lunchbox with hearts on it. And, just like that, October arrives.\u00a0 That\u2019s when my son can no longer dull his sparkle. Last year it happened on National Coming Out Day.\u00a0 I shit you not. \u201cI did it,\u201d he said as he was getting in the car after school. \u201cYou did what?\u201d I asked.\u00a0 Not at all sure what the answer might be. \u201cI told my friends that I like girl stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat did they say?\u201d \u201cThey said that they already knew and then they ran to the slide to play.\u201d This year, C.J. was selected to be Star of the Week the week of National Coming Out Day.\u00a0 When you\u2019re Star of the Week, the whole week is about you.\u00a0 In kindergarten, C.J. hated being Star of the Week because he didn\u2019t want the focus to be on him; he didn\u2019t want to share himself with the whole class because he was afraid of what some of them might say.\u00a0 Being Star of the Week is hard when you\u2019re a rainbow. First Grade C.J. was relieved to be Star of the Week.\u00a0 He wanted to use it as the chance to come out to his classmates as a boy who like girl stuff and boy stuff.\u00a0 The last three words of his claim aren\u2019t truthful.\u00a0 C.J. does not like \u201cboy stuff.\u201d\u00a0 None of it.\u00a0 I struggle to think of something characteristically \u201cmasculine\u201d that he does like.\u00a0 I would have to offer up that he likes riding his bike (which is Monster High themed) and doing gymnastics (which isn\u2019t typically perceived as the most masculine sport, but it\u2019s the only sport that my son will do).\u00a0 He also likes laughing at farts and making up rhymes and jokes that include the word \u201cpoop.\u201d\u00a0 Is that behavior considered more \u201cmasculine\u201d leaning? But, if it makes him feel better to tell the kids at school that he likes girl stuff and boy stuff, that\u2019s absolutely fine with me. Monday: Star Of The Week Day 1:\u00a0 C.J. had to bring in an \u201cAll About Me\u201d poster.\u00a0 We spent the weekend getting his poster just right.\u00a0 He has very high standards. Favorite Animal:\u00a0 Turtle Favorite Food:\u00a0 Strawberries Favorite Color:\u00a0 Rainbow Favorite Place:\u00a0 Colorado When I grow up, I want to be a:\u00a0 Artist Favorite thing to do is: Play with my friends If I had one wish, I would wish for:\u00a0 I wish that people would understand me and not tease me because my style is different.\u00a0 I wish that colors and toys and clothes could be for everyone \u2013 not \u201cjust for boys\u201d and \u201cjust for girls.\u201d\u00a0 I like boys stuff and girl stuff.  When he dictated his wish to me, I was a mix of sadness and pride.\u00a0 I was sad that his biggest wish is to be able to like what he wants to like and be himself without the negative reactions and judgments of others.\u00a0 And, I was proud that he was brave enough to share all of that with his 28 classmates so that he wouldn\u2019t have to self-edit as much while at school. \u201cWhat did the kids say about your wish?\u201d I asked after school. \u201cSome kids already knew.\u00a0 Some kids didn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0 Some kids laughed at me.\u00a0 But, those are the kids who laugh at everything,\u201d he replied matter-of-factly.\u00a0 He was unfazed by the laughers, so I was too. Tuesday: Star Of The Week Day 2:\u00a0 C.J. had to share one of his most prized possessions with the class.\u00a0 He was going to share one of his favorite books, Roland Humphrey Is Wearing A What?, which is about a gender nonconforming boy who wears girl clothes to school and overcomes teasing. Instead, he decided to earn some major playground cred and envious admirers by showing off two autographed photos.\u00a0 One of the cast of Jessie and one of the cast of Sam & Cat.\u00a0 It worked like magic, just as he knew it would.\u00a0 He can already read a crowd.\u00a0 He was the coolest kid in first grade when he whipped out those autographed photos. Wednesday: Star Of The Week Day 3:\u00a0 He led the class in some math-guessing game. Thursday: Star Of The Week Day 4:\u00a0 Every student in the class wrote him a letter and drew him a picture. Friday: Star Of The Week Day 5:\u00a0 He got to bring home the letters and pictures that his classmates made for him.\u00a0 And, this is what I saw that warmed my heart and spread my smile. \u00a0These are just five of 28. That\u2019s C.J. as an artist when he grows up with one of his girl friends. This is C.J. walking under a rainbow with one of his very best girl friends (and protectors). This is C.J. with one of the boys in his class. C.J. is the one in the rainbow shirt, in case you weren\u2019t sure. This is C.J. on an ice cream date with one of his girl friends. This is C.J. holding up a rainbow for one of his girl friends. This girl wrote \u201cI think you\u2019re amazing\u201d in her letter to him.  Since his turn as Star of the Week, C.J. has started to wear his socks from the \u201cpink section\u201d to school.\u00a0 Now, every day he wears his rainbow BFF necklace that he shares with his friend Twirl.\u00a0 And, he took his pink lunchbox with the hearts on it school for a week.\u00a0 Then he broke the zipper.\u00a0 So, now he takes one in the shape of a sweet owl that is intended for girls, but loved by my son\u2026..the Star of the Week.
