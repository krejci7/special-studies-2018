On Wednesday morning, I appeared on Fox\u2019s Good Day L.A., the top local morning show in Southern California.\u00a0 Here\u2019s my interview.\u00a0 Please take a moment to admire my shoes, which were C.J.-picked-and-approved.  * * * My Good Day L.A. appearance came on the heels of a five-day-long trip to Atlanta to present at the Salon LGBTQ Conference \u2014 the\u00a0first national LGBTQ social media conference. I had a special travel buddy with me on this trip.\u00a0 I took C.J. and he got some quality playtime with his BFF Twirl, who is the son of \u00a0fellow Salon LGBTQ panelist Kelly who blogs at \u00a0It\u2019s a Bold Life. * * * Next up on my appearance schedule is Palm Springs Pride.\u00a0 Who\u2019s going?\u00a0 I\u2019ll be in the Author\u2019s Village on Sunday, November 3, at 1 p.m., to talk about my family\u2019s experiences and sign books. It\u2019s my first Palm Springs Pride and only my second pride ever\u2026.so stop by and make me feel welcome. \u00a0My brother has informed me that many people may not be sober at 1 p.m. on Sunday. \u00a0That\u2019s okay, you can stop by and say \u201chi\u201d even if you are under the influence. \u00a0Just promise not to puke or otherwise soil me in any way. * * * A reader\u00a0sent me the link to an article\u00a0about \u201cNew York-based photographer\u00a0Leland Bobb\u00e9, (who) has put together a fascinating series of portraits that examine the idea of gender fluidity by showing New York City drag queens in half-drag.\u201d C.J. has asked to look the photos every night before bed.\u00a0 He is completely enthralled.\u00a0 He looks at each picture as a whole, then takes a piece of paper and covers up the queen side to see the man side first.\u00a0 Then, he slides the paper to cover the man side and stare at the queen side.\u00a0 Then, he looks at the photo as a whole again.\u00a0 He notices all of the detail\u2026.and he wants colored contact lenses for Christmas. \u201cWith these images my intention is to capture both the male and the alter ego female side of these subjects in one image in order to explore the cross over between males and females and to break down the physical barriers that separate them. This in turn questions the normative ideas about gender and gender fluidity. Through the power of hair and makeup these men are able to completely transform themselves and find their female side while showing their male side simultaneously. These are composed in camera and are not two separate images digitally composed.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Leland Bobb\u00e9 * * * This week Mamalode published a BEAUTIFUL piece written by a mother of a gender nonconforming girl.\u00a0 Read it.\u00a0 I mean it. \u201cMy feral girl steps across gender lines and has become to me her own species. Out on our farm in summer, she runs shirtless in little boy boxer briefs, climbs to the top of our rusty swing set and, to me, she is just Eliza. But when I see her in a room full of other six-year-old girls, I realize, again, she\u2019s different. This is no news flash to her. Eliza cultivates this difference without meaning to\u2026\u201d Read the full piece here:\u00a0 http://mamalode.com/story/detail/half-half * * *   ", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
