I\u2019m kidding.\u00a0 The only reason why I\u2019m even halfway done with my shopping is because I can do it in my jammies from the comfort of my couch and laptop.\u00a0 How did people do it before online shopping? Here are some of my suggestions for gifts and giving, in case you have half your recipients to shop for, too. Donate to GLAAD:\u00a0My friend Jennifer Finney Boylan serves as GLAAD\u2019s national co-chair (she\u2019s the first transgender person to do so, FYI).\u00a0 GLAAD is a nonprofit organization that fights for LGBT equality through media advocacy. Like Jennifer and me, GLAAD believes that the most powerful way to improve the lives of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender adults and children is through the power of stories.\u00a0 And, it\u2019s by amplifying the stories of families like mine on film, in print and online,\u00a0that GLAAD helps to change the world. Through the rest of 2013, the Gill Foundation is matching all donations made to GLAAD. \u00a0\u00a0You can donate in honor of or tribute to someone and that could be a great holiday gift.\u00a0 GLAAD and my family are welcoming donations in tribute of \u201cLori Duron and Family.\u201d\u00a0 To get giving click here:\u00a0 www.glaad.org/donate. \u00a0On that page you\u2019ll be asked to fill out the usual info; there\u2019s also a button marked \u201cMake a Tribute Gift\u201d and if you click there, you\u2019ll see the place to write down the name of the person you are making the donation in tribute of.\u00a0 You can even set it up for them to receive an email letting them know that you have made a donation in their name. * * * Buy My Book:\u00a0Look at the fabulous books that my friends, readers and supporters have created for you to give as gifts to the people you love! pleasure. Raising My Rainbow by ME!

You could consider a holiday gift to help their campers have the best possible experience. $600 covers tuition cost for one camper $350 covers camp\u2019s costs for having one camp volunteer $100 is a big help toward food and supplies camp programs You can donate here: camparanutiq.org/donate. * * * In non-holiday related news:\u00a0 If you live in the UK, there is a network and production company putting together a film about parenting a gender nonconforming son. They are looking for gender nonconforming boys and families who are interested in learning more about the film and possibly participating in it. They assure me that their approach is supportive, not judgmental.\u00a0 They are a well-established, award-winning science and factual independent TV production company with worldwide experience supplying to the main channels in the UK.
