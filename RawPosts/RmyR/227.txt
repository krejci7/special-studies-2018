We have fun and hangout. I don\u2019t think it is right for you to give money to stop my uncle from getting married. People who are gay are humans just like us. They are not different in any way. \u00a0They are just people who want to be in love and get married to people of the same sex.\u00a0 I feel sad for my uncle because he should have the same rights as me. This is just like when black people didn\u2019t have the same rights as white people. They were born the way they were born and should have the same rights as us. This is why I think you should stop all this nonsense.\u00a0 Gay people should be treated with equal rights. I\u2019m going to tell other people that they shouldn\u2019t eat at Chick-Fil-A. I can\u2019t believe you said the things you said, because you say you are a Christian and you are supposed to act rightful and respectful and not say that people aren\u2019t created equal. Especially gays and lesbians. \u00a0I\u2019m a Christian too. When you say mean things, gay people get their feelings hurt and when that happens Jesus wishes he could do something to help them. Like make a miracle. When you get to heaven I think that Jesus will say \u201cyou made the wrong decision, man.\u201d I used to eat at Chick-Fil-A a lot and now I don\u2019t want to eat there until gay people win in the end.\u00a0 Now I\u2019m going to eat at subway. It\u2019s healthier anyway. Sincerely, C.J.\u2019s Brother, Age 9 Orange County, Calif. Former Chick-Fil-A Foothill Ranch Customer   ", "feedtitle": "Page 23 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
