This time, the treasure chest was loaded with fancy parachuting army men and jeweled tiaras.\u00a0 Obviously our dentist has begun to compete with the fancy Orange County pediatric dentist down the street who has a Wii in the lobby, the latest G-rated flicks playing on flat screens over the exam chairs and Bose headphones with pre-programmed iPods for the tweens. \u00a0Guess which toy C.J. selected?\u00a0 The tiara.\u00a0 You know him so well. He lit up when he slipped on that crown and all the trauma and drama of getting his teeth cleaned faded from memory.\u00a0 The receptionist who was booking our next appointment started to laugh at C.J.\u00a0 It was understandable.\u00a0 She looked back at her computer and tried to focus.\u00a0 As her eyes returned to C.J., so did her smile.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just can\u2019t concentrate with him wearing that tiara,\u201d she giggled. \u201cGood thing you don\u2019t live in our house, you\u2019d get nothing done,\u201d I replied with a smile.
