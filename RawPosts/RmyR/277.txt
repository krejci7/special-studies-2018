That I might even be promoted to M.I.L.F status when the kids are old enough to know what the \u201cF\u201d in M.I.L.F stands for. \u00a0After all, it\u2019s secretly \u2014 and sometimes not so secretly \u2014 what most Orange County moms aspire to. So, C.J.\u2019s Dad got us Sirus Radio when we got a new car and stopped living the mini-van dream.\u00a0 Kids Place Live\u00a0is my channel of choice when the kidlets are passengers; it\u2019s Cosmo Radio when I\u2019m riding solo. And, our favorite song on Kids Place Live is Brady Rymer\u2019s \u201cLove Me For Who I Am.\u201d\u00a0 The main line in the song?\u00a0 The main take-away?\u00a0 \u201cPlease don\u2019t try to fix me, love me for who I am.\u201d\u00a0 Sing it Brady!\u00a0 It reminds me so much of C.J.\u00a0  The song was inspired by differently-abled\u00a0kids, but could be an anthem for any kid who is different.\u00a0 NPR says that Brady Rymer\u00a0and his rootsy, funky rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band \u201cmight just be the best-sounding band in children\u2019s music.\u201d\u00a0 C.J. agrees and gives Brady Rymer two little thumbs up\u2026actually he puts his two index fingers up and thinks he\u2019s giving the thumbs up sign, but you get the drift.\u00a0 Enjoy the lyrics!
