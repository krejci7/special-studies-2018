 We like to rock out in the car.  I have been known to dance in the driver’s seat and sing so loud and with such a flair for the dramatic that C.J.’s brother once told me, “Mom, sometimes you embarrass me even when nobody is around.”   And, here I thought I was a “cool” mom. That I might even be promoted to M.I.L.F status when the kids are old enough to know what the “F” in M.I.L.F stands for.  After all, it’s secretly — and sometimes not so secretly — what most Orange County moms aspire to. So, C.J.’s Dad got us Sirus Radio when we got a new car and stopped living the mini-van dream.  Kids Place Live is my channel of choice when the kidlets are passengers; it’s Cosmo Radio when I’m riding solo. And, our favorite song on Kids Place Live is Brady Rymer’s “Love Me For Who I Am.”  The main line in the song?  The main take-away?  “Please don’t try to fix me, love me for who I am.”  Sing it Brady!  It reminds me so much of C.J.   The song was inspired by differently-abled kids, but could be an anthem for any kid who is different.  NPR says that Brady Rymer and his rootsy, funky rock ‘n’ roll band “might just be the best-sounding band in children’s music.”  C.J. agrees and gives Brady Rymer two little thumbs up…actually he puts his two index fingers up and thinks he’s giving the thumbs up sign, but you get the drift.  Enjoy the lyrics!
