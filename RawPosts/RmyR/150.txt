In preparation for this next phase of Chase\u2019s athletic career, we decided that he needs to see tackle football live (not just on TV) so he can fully understand that he will be tackled and expected to tackle someone else.\u00a0 He\u2019s such a kind, gentle, loving soul and I\u2019m afraid that the first time someone knocks him to the ground in an act of aggression it\u2019s going to shock the shit out of him. Matt found out that our high school alma mater was playing a football game five minutes from our house, so one recent Friday night we loaded in the car, grabbed hamburgers for dinner and headed to the stadium for the game. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna watch football.\u00a0 Football is soooooo boring,\u201d C.J. complained, slumping his shoulders and walking with dread through the parking lot. \u201cThere will be cheerleaders\u2026\u201d I said. \u201cI love cheerleaders!\u00a0 Do we have to sit on the grass or is there a place for the audience to sit?\u201d C.J. asked. \u201cWhen you watch sports you\u2019re a fan, not an audience, and you sit in the stands or the bleachers.\u201d\u00a0 C.J. has a lot to learn to about sports, but isn\u2019t the least bit interested in learning it. We walked into the stadium and C.J. saw the cheerleaders instantly.\u00a0 They were standing on boxes with their names written on them. C.J.:\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d Me:\u00a0 \u201cHannah.\u201d C.J.:\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s that one\u2019s name?\u201d Me:\u00a0 \u201cHannah.\u201d C.J.:\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s the brown-haired girl\u2019s name?\u201d Me:\u00a0 \u201cHannah.\u201d C.J.:\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s so many Hannahs!\u00a0 Do you have to be named Hannah to be a cheerleader?\u00a0 Cause my name\u2019s not Hannah.\u201d I agreed.\u00a0 There were a lot of Hannahs.\u00a0 There were a lot of cheerleaders, period.\u00a0 There were a lot of people.\u00a0 We had a hard time finding seats.\u00a0 I looked around.\u00a0 I leaned over to Matt. \u201cI think it\u2019s Homecoming,\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cDid you plan this as a romantic gesture for your high school sweetheart?\u201d\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t.\u00a0 Whatever. C.J. watched the freshman, sophomore, junior varsity, varsity and alumni cheerleaders cheer.\u00a0 By the middle of the second quarter he was getting bored.\u00a0 (So was I.) \u201cEwwww, what is that costume!?\u201d he said while pointing. \u201cThat\u2019s the uniform that the band wears.\u00a0 That girl is in the band,\u201d I replied. \u201cEwwww, that\u2019s so not good.\u00a0 That\u2019s sad,\u201d he said. I quieted him down.\u00a0 But, he was right.\u00a0 The getups had obviously been selected from the Star Trek-themed pages of the band uniform catalogue. \u201cI wanna go home,\u201d he complained. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave yet, there is a halftime show and they are going to crown the Homecoming Queen,\u201d I said. \u201cTHERES GOING TO BE A QUEEN!!!!\u00a0 YOU DIDN\u2019T TELL ME THERE WAS GOING TO BE A QUEEN!!!\u201d he yelled, causing the two rows in front of us to turn and look. \u201cWHERE IS SHE?????\u201d he said stretching his head out and around to look for her. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who the queen is yet.\u00a0 They are going to bring out the princesses and then announce which one was picked to be the queen,\u201d I whispered into his ear. \u201cTHERE ARE PRINCESSES TOO!!!!!\u201d he yelled.\u00a0 Again the rows turned to look at us.\u00a0 He was nearly shaking with excitement. The Dr. Seuss halftime show started. \u00a0Apparently it was Homecoming in Whoville.\u00a0 There were small skits, dance routines and then the five princesses were loaded into a horse-drawn carriage and were making their way on the track around the football field towards us. \u201cHERE THEY COME.\u00a0 THEY\u2019RE COMING!!!!\u201d\u00a0 C.J. was losing his freaking mind. The princesses took to the stage one at a time as their long list of accomplishments was read.\u00a0 One had, like, a 4.75 G.P.A.\u00a0 Is that even possible?\u00a0 I was always stoked to have above a 3.0. Each princess was stationed in front of a gift-wrapped box.\u00a0 Each box contained a helium balloon and whomever\u2019s balloon had a red paper heart attached to it was the queen.\u00a0 Simultaneously, the princesses started to slowly lift the lids off of their boxes. C.J. had is hands clasped together and held up to his heart.\u00a0 He was holding his breath.\u00a0 There were princesses, gift boxes, balloons and hearts.\u00a0 C.J. could not have been more in his element. The girl on the far left won.\u00a0 It was a beauty pageant moment.\u00a0 She brought her hands to her mouth in shock.\u00a0 She had a surprised-Taylor-Swift face.\u00a0 The crown was placed atop her shiny dark hair and a cape was draped on her slender shoulders. \u201cSHE CAN\u2019T WIN!!!!!!\u00a0 SHE DOESN\u2019T HAVE THE BEST DRESS!!!!\u00a0 THE GIRL OVER THERE WITH THE PINK GLITTER DRESS SHOULD BE THE QUEEN!!!!!\u201d C.J. was on his feet pointing firmly to the girl who \u2013 in his humble opinion \u2013 should be the Homecoming Queen.\u00a0 The two rows in front of us turned to look again.\u00a0 I was hoping that a smile would hide my embarrassment. I tried to explain to C.J. that the Homecoming Queen is supposed to win based on her achievements, not her dress.\u00a0 He argued that that was stupid and that it should be based on her dress. \u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d Matt asked me. We started to make our way down the stadium steps. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you all in the gym for the 2013 Homecoming Dance!\u201d the football announcer said over the loud speaker. \u201cYAAAAAAYYYYYYYY!!!!! WE GET TO GO TO A DANCE!!!!!! IS IT TONIGHT?\u00a0 WHAT GYM?\u00a0 LA FITNESS WHERE YOU WORK OUT, MOMMY?\u201d \u201cNo, baby, it\u2019s at the high school gym and it\u2019s only for the teenagers.\u201d \u201cBut that man just invited me and I can wear one of my dresses\u2026\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t go until you\u2019re in high school,\u201d I said exhausted by the endless questions. \u201cI already know what dress I\u2019ll wear,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course you do.\u201d   ", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
