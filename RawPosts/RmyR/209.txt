Mannequin head with human hair that can be heat styled = One of C.J.\u2019s favorite Christmas presents. A friend of mine doesn\u2019t like odd-numbered years because they are typically unlucky for her.\u00a0 I thought back on my odd-numbered years.\u00a0 My odd-numbered years include graduation from high school, graduation from college, getting married, having C.J.\u2019s Brother, having C.J. and starting this blog.\u00a0 If I didn\u2019t want to jinx myself, I\u2019d say that odd-numbered years have always been good to me. Two years ago I started Raising My Rainbow because I had a two-(almost three)-year-old boy who liked \u201cgirl toys\u201d and \u201cgirl clothes.\u201d\u00a0 I was full of questions and anxiety.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know what was going on with my son and his preferences.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know what I was supposed to do as his parent.\u00a0 I had a million questions but no answers.\u00a0 I used humor and writing to cope and started to feel my way down a path I hadn\u2019t ever expected to take. Then, things got emotional as my readers educated me and I realized that the simple act of my son playing with a doll could be a signal of much bigger things to come. \u00a0Was our son a girl born into the body of a boy?\u00a0 Was he transgender, transsexual, effeminate, gay, gender queer, gender fluid, gender creative, gender nonconforming, something else?\u00a0 What do those terms really mean anyway? As parents, my husband and I have asked each other and ourselves questions that we never anticipated.\u00a0 What if our son is gay?\u00a0 What if our son is bullied?\u00a0 What do we do when our third grader threatens suicide because he\u2019s bullied for having a gender nonconforming brother?\u00a0 Ten years from now, will we have two sons or one son and one daughter? Another favorite Christmas gift? A Monster High bike with bag to hold his granola bars and bracelets. During the last two years, we slowly got to the point where we knew the answer to each of the questions above and dozens of others.\u00a0 It\u2019s the same answer, no matter the question: We\u2019ll deal with it.\u00a0 We\u2019ll love, support and provide a safe home for our children no matter what.\u00a0 Realizing that answer gave us power and reassurance. We\u2019ll deal with it.\u00a0 We\u2019ll deal with it.\u00a0 We\u2019ll.\u00a0 Deal.\u00a0 With.\u00a0 It. We began to own our differences.\u00a0 All of us: Me, C.J.\u2019s Dad, C.J.\u2019s Brother and C.J.\u00a0 We began to live free of shame.\u00a0 Then, four months ago, C.J. started kindergarten and stopped owning it.\u00a0 We\u2019ve watched as our diva son who was once brimming with confidence and self-assuredness realized that his peers had less than favorable opinions about what he likes and wears, about how he talks and walks, about how he sits with his legs crossed like a girl and has a wrist that goes limp when not kept in check. There was a time when our gender creative son didn\u2019t care about what other people thought about him, but we did \u2013 big time.\u00a0 We were stuck caring what others would think or say or do.\u00a0 He owned it, but we didn\u2019t.\u00a0 We followed his lead.\u00a0 We caught up.\u00a0 And, when we started owning it and not giving a shit about the reactions and judgments of others, C.J. started noticing and caring and adjusting his behaviors accordingly.\u00a0 It felt like we were two steps behind.\u00a0 We caught up to him.\u00a0 We were all at the same point for a time holding hands.\u00a0 And, then C.J. took a step back, yanking us back with him. Back we went, following his lead.\u00a0 Loving him, not changing him. He\u2019s been rocking his new beanie day and night. When I started this blog I promised myself that I\u2019d write for a year and reassess.\u00a0 I did that and decided to continue writing for another year and reassess.\u00a0 I just spent two weeks doing that.\u00a0 I\u2019ve decided to give it another year.\u00a0 And, I\u2019ll need your help, feedback and support more than ever before as we enter a new phase. I hope that you\u2019ll continue to follow and be a part of our adventures.\u00a0 There\u2019s comfort in knowing that you care and are cheering us on. Let\u2019s make 2013 fabulous! Xoxo, Mom, Dad, Brother and C.J.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 21 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
