The film will be part of a campaign to increase visibility, awareness and acceptance. She\u2019s looking to connect with parents, families, friends and allies who are at various points of the journey and open to the idea of sharing their stories on-camera. She\u2019s also looking for teens, young adults and adults who were gender nonconforming as children to be interviewed as experts. Interested?

This week\u2019s episode is my favorite so far. Neil Patrick Harris, David Burtka, Joe Manganiello\u00a0and Willam Belli star. Enough said.  * * * All you moms out there have got to watch I Do Not Like Shaved Legs and Spanx, a Nick Mom parody of I Do Not Like Green Eggs and Ham. It\u2019s the launch of \u201cmotherfunny\u201d parodies of popular children\u2019s books geared toward moms who\u2019ve seen it all. I can totally relate to this episode because I happen to not like shaved legs and spanx. Have a great weekend,\u00a0 C.J.\u2019s Mom   ", "feedtitle": "Page 21 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
