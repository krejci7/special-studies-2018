Guess who the narrator is? \u00a0Me! I\u2019m grateful that Audible allowed me to narrate the book. It would have been weird to hear someone else owning the words I wrote about my family. \u00a0(I just had to get over hating the sound of my own voice.) Here\u2019s an excerpt from the book before it is released:  Guess who narrated the audiobook\u2019s foreword? \u00a0The one and only David Burtka! \u00a0I\u2019m forever thankful for the support I\u2019ve received from the Burtka Harris family. \u00a0(I like David\u2019s voice much more than my own.) Listen to David read the book\u2019s\u00a0foreword here: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, audible has named Raising My Rainbow an \u201cEditors Select\u201d book for May 2014. \u00a0Here, my editor explains why it was selected: Editors Select, May 2014 \u2013 I have been a fan of Lori Duron and her blog, Raising My Rainbow, for a few years now. When I learned that Audible Studios was producing her book based on her blog, I jumped at the chance to review it. Duron\u2019s book (and blog) shares her and her husband\u2019s funny, heartwarming, and at times heartbreaking experiences in raising a gender nonconforming son. C.J., their youngest son, is a boy who prefers stereotypical girl things \u2013 girl toys, girl activities, girl clothes. I\u2019m not a parent, but the open and honest way that Duron writes about her family, and in particular C.J., is utterly engaging, and provides excellent advice and life lessons for any human being. Narrated by Duron herself, Raising My Rainbow is full of content that never appeared on her blog \u2013 more hilarious C.J. stories, more of her and her husband\u2019s struggles with their parenting decisions, and even a disturbing account of bullying experienced by their older son. This brave memoir teaches that it\u2019s important to fully love the people in your life\u2026no matter what. \u2014Katie, Audible Editor You can pre-order the audiobook now by clicking here . \u00a0(You don\u2019t need to have an Audible.com subscription to purchase\u00a0the book.) \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
