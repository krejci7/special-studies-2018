Because it is not okay for him to peek inside the satchels of strangers, I\u2019ve started easing his curiosity by showing him the pages inside popular magazines that list the contents of celebrities\u2019 bags. He loves those lists so much that he wanted me to create one for him and share it with you. Without further ado, here is what\u2019s inside my son\u2019s purse.  Purse: I made my purse. Well, I didn\u2019t \u201cmake it\u201d make it. I colored in the design. I like this purse cause it holds a lot of stuff and I have a lot of stuff to hold. I can also wear it across my body so my hands are free to hold more stuff. Plastic Show Pony: I got this pony at Disney Princesses On Ice. It\u2019s beautiful and pretty and special. I named it Uni for unicorn. Because it\u2019s like a unicorn, without a horn, so it\u2019s not a unicorn, but I pretend that it is. The Cat In The Hat Book: I keep it in my purse because I really wanted it and last time I found one it was in Spanish and I finally found it in English. And, I really love The Cat In The Hat. \u00a0I can\u2019t read Spanish. Green Finger Pointer: I like green, it\u2019s one of my favorite colors besides red, purple, pink and rainbow. I use it to point when I pretend that I\u2019m playing school and I\u2019m the teacher. It makes pointing easier. Sometimes I pretend to pick my nose with it and it\u2019s green like boogers. \u00a0So, that\u2019s perfect. Tiny Plush Giraffe: Doesn\u2019t he look like a baby toy? Well, he\u2019s way more than that; he\u2019s also a finger puppet! Can you believe that?! \u00a0So, I like it because his tail is fringy and I like his hair. I named him Bobby. Fancy Lady Head Brooch:\u00a0She\u2019s diamond-y. Her favorite thing in the whole wide world is diamonds and if she got $1,008 dollars she would spend it all on diamonds and nothing else. Gingerbread Boy: I made him gender conforming. I like his hair. I gave him green highlights. I like how I made his pants roll up at the bottom. I gave him a HUGE smiley face because he\u2019s always happy like the song \u201cHappy\u201d by Pharrell. I think Pharrell\u2019s hat is crazy-cool. Pink Bag Of Coins: I want to keep them and save them up and buy something from miWorld. I also told Nana that I wanted something from miWorld so possibly she\u2019ll get it for me and I can save my money. (Don\u2019t tell anybody that this is fake money.) Anna from Disney\u2019s\u00a0Frozen:\u00a0I like her because she talks when you push on her boobs and stomach.\u00a0Frozen\u00a0is my favorite movie right now. I like it because two girls save the day and they don\u2019t need a boy. And, I like the dresses that Elsa and Anna wear. $5: I got a dollar. It\u2019s actually five dollars. I earned this money doing chores for my Pa. I keep it in my purse in case I need more dollars and it\u2019s special because it\u2019s the only five-dollar bill I have. It\u2019s my biggest money I ever got. If I did spend it, I would spend it on a time machine so If I didn\u2019t want to go to school I could just skip ahead and skip it. Fancy Skeleton Head:\u00a0It\u2019s a girl, but she has a beard. My daddy gave it to me when he got back from Mexico. It reminds me of Spanish. \u00a0My mom\u2019s skeleton head will look this fancy when she dies and her skin falls off. Harajuku Girl Figurine: Because I like Gwen Stefani and everything Harajuku. They are pretty and super sassy. Brown Chair:\u00a0I keep it because it reminds me of a chair at our house. Fairly Odd Parents Doll: I got it at Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s when I played one game and got 1,000 tickets. Last time I got 100 tickets on the exact same game. You should play that game when you go to Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s. I like his hair. I think it\u2019s cool that he has green hair and I like that he\u2019s a fairy. iTouch: My mommy gave it to me. It\u2019s my first own electronic thing. My favorite apps are Fruit Ninja, Kick the Dummy, McKenna the American Girl doing gymnastics and any app where you make dresses and do makeovers. Lip Gloss: Which I can put on right now (applies gloss). I keep it in my purse so that I can put it on when I need to. Like when I go to school. Sometimes I can wear my mom\u2019s lipstick, but only if I ask. I got this lip gloss at Sephora. I love Sephora. You should go there. They have every makeup ever made. Fake Rat: I use it to scare people. If they try to rob my purse they would see the rat and scream and stop robbing me. Miniature Gumball Machine: It reminds me of love because the gumballs are heart-shaped and I love it and I love love. Rainbow Dash From My Little Pony: It reminds me of my mom\u2019s book called Raising My Rainbow.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
