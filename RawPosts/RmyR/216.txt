Someplace where you\u2019ve never, ever been before,\u201d I said looking at him with a mischievous smile. \u201cYay!\u201d A few minutes later, we stood at the open double doors of the nail salon and he looked at me with a huge grin.\u00a0 He gripped my hand a little tighter in excitement. \u201cIs this the nail store?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes, this is where you go when you want your nails painted really nice and pretty,\u201d I replied. \u201cI always want my nails painted really nice and pretty,\u201d he said to me quietly. \u201cI know.\u201d C.J. picked these colors for his first pedicure because they reminded him of Monster High. He saw the wall racked with a rainbow of colored polishes and ran over to them.\u00a0 I informed the receptionist that we wanted two pedicures.\u00a0 I paused. \u201cC.J., do you want your fingernails and toenails painted or just your toes?\u201d I asked in clarification. \u201cJust my toes, cause when I wear my shoes no one can see them.\u201d \u201cTwo pedicures please,\u201d I said. We were escorted to our huge vibrating Japanese massage chairs and foot baths filled with warm water and suds. C.J. was near giggles watching his feet soak and I was near giggles watching my son get his first professional pedicure. \u00a0The salon was quiet; all eyes were on us \u2014 my son and me on an 11 a.m. pedicure date. \u201cMama, you need to tell them to get the hard stuff off of your tootsies,\u201d he said giving my feet a disgusted look.\u00a0 Rude. The pedicure pros got to work on our feet and a frenzy of chatter and laughter started.\u00a0 I was wishing I were fluent in the language that they were speaking so that I could eavesdrop when I heard the manager walking toward us shaking her head in disapproval.\u00a0 The girl doing my pedicure lightly smacked my foot getting my attention to ask me a question before the manager got much closer. \u201cIs that a boy or a girl?\u201d she asked, pointing at C.J.\u00a0 Luckily, he wasn\u2019t really paying attention to anything other than his toes and couldn\u2019t understand her broken English very well anyway. \u201cHe\u2019s a boy,\u201d I said, looking at my son in his brother\u2019s hand-me-downed blue athletic shorts and a blue shirt with a police car on the front.\u00a0 He was looking surprisingly boyish if you ask me.\u00a0 But, then again, I\u2019m used to seeing him in a skirt, heels, clip-on earrings and lip-gloss. The embarrassed manager said she was sorry and diverted her path towards the back of the salon. \u201cOh, cause I thought it was a girl.\u00a0 But, her and her thought it was a boy.\u00a0 And, her, her and her thought it was a girl.\u00a0 We were taking bets,\u201d my pedicurist said smiling and pointing to the other salon workers as she went along. She was amused and I was shocked.\u00a0 I leaned over towards my feet and towards my nail girl so that she could hear me better, but C.J. couldn\u2019t. \u201cWell, he\u2019s a boy, so I guess her and her are the winners,\u201d I said with un-amused tone and look, pointing to the two salon employees who had correctly guessed that my son was a boy.\u00a0 None of them would make eye contact with me. C.J. was oblivious and I did everything in my power to keep it that way.\u00a0 Our pedicures were done and we walked out of the salon holding hands with toilet paper rolled up and stuck between our freshly polished toes.\u00a0 When I saw C.J. staring at his toes and smiling, I smiled too. C.J.\u2019s first professional pedicure. He added tiny butterfly stickers. A few weeks of begging later, I took him to a different salon for a pedicure.\u00a0 He was selecting a color when his pedicurist approached him. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a color,\u201d she said, grabbing him gently by the shoulders and steering him away from the colors and towards the pedicure chair. I stopped her in her path. \u201cColors are the best part of the pedicure,\u201d I said to her.\u00a0 \u201cAren\u2019t they, C.J.?\u201d C.J. and I selected our colors.\u00a0 Then, C.J. vetoed the purplish-gray color that I had picked for myself and picked another color for me.\u00a0\u00a0 I ended up with a C.J.-approved glittering violet and he chose neon pink for himself. We sat in our massive massage chairs and the pedicures began.\u00a0 I read a People Magazine while he played a fashion design game on my iPhone.\u00a0 The lady doing his nails kept sneaking a glance at the neon pink bottle of polish that he had selected. She was saying something to her coworker who was busy working on my feet.\u00a0 They were going back and forth and looking at the neon pink. \u201cLittle boy, you sure you want pink? Why not get blue to match your pants?\u201d she finally asked C.J. C.J. looked at me. \u201cDo you want pink?\u201d I asked him. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, tell her,\u201d I said. \u201cI want pink,\u201d he said shyly. \u201cHe wants pink,\u201d I said looking at her like there was no room for discussion. C.J. smiled at me. \u201cYou want design on your toes?\u00a0 Maybe turkey for Thanksgiving?\u201d C.J. looked appalled.\u00a0 I can guarantee that my son will never want a turkey painted on his toenails. \u201cI want a flower,\u201d he said. I smiled at him in encouragement and looked at her matter-of-factly. C.J.\u2019s second professional pedicure. I may never be able to get a pedicure alone again. She granted his wish, while talking even more excitedly with her co-worker in the language that I didn\u2019t know.\u00a0 Again, I wished for a moment that I were fluent in the secret language of pedicurists. Then, I decided that I\u2019m glad that I couldn\u2019t understand what they were saying.\u00a0 Because I really don\u2019t care.\u00a0 My son and I were happy, walking to our car with toilet paper worming between our purple and pink toes, walking on our heels with toes pointing up, like that would help the polish dry faster, hand in hand smiling.\u00a0 My son was happy and that\u2019s all that really matters.
