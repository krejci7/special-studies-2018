I got them both to where they needed to be on the morning of September 10 and rushed back home to park myself on the couch under a blanket to catch up on reality TV, while obsessively and repetitively checking email and Facebook on my laptop and Instagram and Pinterest on my phone.\u00a0 Because that, my friends, is how I relax. As I got myself situated on the sofa the silence of the house caught my attention. It was quiet.\u00a0 Really quiet.\u00a0 The sounds of summer were gone.\u00a0 I got halfway through one episode of Teen Mom 3 and I had a bad feeling.\u00a0 What if, at that very moment, someone was trying to dull C.J.\u2019s sparkle?\u00a0 What if he was being teased for his rainbow-leopard-print backpack?\u00a0 What if he was being teased for his pink, heart-covered lunchbox?\u00a0 What if he was being teased for his hair that is growing out?\u00a0 What if?\u00a0 What if?\u00a0 What if?\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t concentrate on mindless TV.\u00a0 Ugh! I thought of that morning.\u00a0 I followed behind Chase as he walked onto campus.\u00a0 He was high-fiving people through the hallways and reinforcing why we call him \u201cThe Mayor.\u201d\u00a0 He knows everybody and is full of a confidence that is more kind and innocent than cocky.\u00a0 He\u2019s just a great, happy, friendly person. Thirty minutes later we were at C.J.\u2019s school and he was holding onto my hand for dear life.\u00a0 The transition from kindergarten to first grade is a big deal.\u00a0 Gone are the half-day of instruction, private playground, protective atmosphere and kids and parents who know C.J. is, well, C.J.\u00a0 \u00a0This year he has to stand in line on the playground with 1,150 other first through sixth graders waiting for the bell to ring.\u00a0 He was overwhelmed.\u00a0 Understandably so. When I picked C.J. up from school, his teacher had the class in a single file line and was dismissing one student at a time.\u00a0 I could see C.J. at the back of the line.\u00a0 He looked up at me and then immediately looked down.\u00a0 He was fighting back tears.\u00a0 I started to do the same. When he got to me, I asked him how his day was. \u201cFine,\u201d he said as we walked.\u00a0 He was lying.\u00a0 We got into the car and the tears spilled down his cheeks. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby?\u201d I asked. \u201cI spent all day afraid that the big kids were going to tease me cause they don\u2019t know that I\u2019m gender nonconforming yet.\u00a0 And, it was the longest day ever.\u00a0 I\u2019m tired.\u00a0 First grade is way too long,\u201d he explained. \u201cWho did you sit with at lunch?\u201d \u201cI sat at the boys\u2019 table and it was so boring.\u201d\u00a0 There are not boys\u2019 tables and girls\u2019 tables at lunch, that\u2019s just naturally how the kids divide. \u201cHow come you didn\u2019t sit with your girl friends?\u201d I asked.\u00a0 C.J. only has girl friends. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want the bigger boys to tease me.\u201d \u201cDid the boys say anything about your lunchbox?\u201d I asked.\u00a0 He\u2019d been not so patiently waiting to use it for weeks. \u201cI didn\u2019t carry it to the lunch tables.\u00a0 I took all of my food out and carried it in my hands to the tables so that nobody would see my lunchbox.\u201d My heart broke as I envisioned him trying to carry a sandwich, juice box, chips, granola bar and sliced fruit to the lunch tables on the other side of campus. We role-played that night during bath time. \u201cWhat if someone said \u2018why do you have a girls lunchbox?\u2019\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019d say because that\u2019s my style and everyone can have their own style,\u201d he replied not missing a beat and sounding like he really believed his own words. \u201cSee!\u00a0 You\u2019re great!\u00a0 That\u2019s what you would say!\u201d I encouraged him. \u201cIt\u2019s harder when it\u2019s really happening,\u201d he said looking down.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t argue with that. I offered to go get him a new lunchbox.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want to.\u00a0 He likes his pink lunchbox.\u00a0 But, the next day he took his lunch in a brown paper bag.\u00a0 And, he has everyday since. That was Tuesday. \u00a0Day One. On Wednesday, Chase came home and said that he needed to talk to me privately. \u201cA kid in my class made a racist remark at the lunch tables and I told him that it wasn\u2019t very nice, especially since there was a person of color at the table.\u00a0 Then the same kid used the word \u2018gay\u2019 in the bad way and I told him not to do that because it\u2019s rude and because my uncle is gay and my brother is gender nonconforming.\u00a0 He said that being gay is sick and bad and wrong.\u00a0 He said that I\u2019m not a good Christian if I like gay people. \u00a0It\u2019s all really been bothering me,\u201d Chase said. He stared at me.\u00a0 I stared back at him, trying to keep my immediate reactions from flying out of my mouth. \u201cWow.\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 So that all happened,\u201d I said as he continued to stare at me.\u00a0 I swear, I cannot get away from gender and sexuality issues.\u00a0 Even when I\u2019m just trying to hide in my house and stare at three screens simultaneously, my kids are out in the world experiencing things that aren\u2019t okay. \u201cWell, baby, above all else, God said to love others and not judge, so you should tell that kid to focus on that.\u00a0 Besides, he made a big assumption that everybody is the same religion.\u00a0 Then, maybe you two should agree to disagree.\u00a0 Not all kids your age have the same opinions and worldviews as you do.\u00a0 A lot of them don\u2019t know about the struggle for LGBTQ equality yet.\u00a0 I bet that kid has never even met a gay person.\u00a0 You\u2019re a little more worldly in that regard.\u201d\u00a0 I was making it all up as I went along. On Thursday, pretty much the exact same conversation took place at lunchtime with two other kids joining in to tell Chase that being gay is sick, bad, wrong and gross and against God, Jesus and the Bible.\u00a0 \u00a0They said that we are a bad family. I emailed the teacher and principal. Then, on Friday, C.J. got was upset that a girl from his class told him that his backpack is for girls. \u201cI told her that it wasn\u2019t, that backpacks are for everybody and that is just my style.\u201d He was proud of himself.\u00a0 He was smiling. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d \u201cShe said I was a liar and that it\u2019s only for girls and I can\u2019t carry it.\u201d \u201cBackpacks are for anyone who has a back and needs a pack,\u201d I said, shaking my head in pure exhaustion. The first four days of school.\u00a0 My youngest is afraid of getting teased at lunch, while my oldest is actually getting teased at lunch.\u00a0 I\u2019ve already had to be in contact with two principals, two teachers and one vice principal.\u00a0 We\u2019ve already been called a bad family.\u00a0 And, I\u2019m still not caught up on my reality television shows.\u00a0 This should be an interesting school year.
