 My Halloween post is up, but not here, at TheAtlantic.com.   “My son C.J. is going to be Alice, of Alice In Wonderland, for Halloween. More specifically, he will be Tim Burton’s Alice because, at nearly seven years old, he’s starting to outgrow his infatuation with the leading ladies of Disney. While Disney represents the sweet innocence and make-believe aspects of early life, my son—even though he’s only in first grade—has found comfort and a sense of camaraderie in the dark, quirky fantasy worlds created by Tim Burton. They are worlds where being different is often celebrated. My son is different. He wants to be celebrated.” Click here to read the full post.  * * * Next up on my appearance schedule is Palm Springs Pride.  It’s this weekend.  Who’s going?  I’ll be in the Author’s Village on Sunday, November 3, at 1 p.m., for a meet and greet and to sign books. It’s my first Palm Springs Pride and only my second pride ever….so stop by and make me feel welcome.  Please.
