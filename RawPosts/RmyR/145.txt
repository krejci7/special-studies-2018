More specifically, he will be Tim Burton\u2019s Alice because, at nearly seven years old, he\u2019s starting to outgrow his infatuation with the leading ladies of Disney. While Disney represents the sweet innocence and make-believe aspects of early life, my son\u2014even though he\u2019s only in first grade\u2014has found comfort and a sense of camaraderie in the dark, quirky fantasy worlds created by Tim Burton. They are worlds where being different is often celebrated. My son is different. He wants to be celebrated.\u201d Click here to read the full post.  * * * Next up on my appearance schedule is Palm Springs Pride.\u00a0 It\u2019s this weekend.\u00a0 Who\u2019s going?\u00a0 I\u2019ll be in the Author\u2019s Village on Sunday, November 3, at 1 p.m., for a meet and greet and to sign books.
