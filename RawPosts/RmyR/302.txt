 Last weekend was the huge, annual neighborhood garage sale hosted by the local real estate agent (you know, that lady with the big hair who sends all the note pads and calendars).  Oh, yeah, it was big doings.  Six streets participated and everybody was out early at 7 a.m. ready to sell their wares and stuff their fanny packs full of riches. My kids love garage sales. To say that one man’s trash is another man’s treasure doesn’t do their excitement for garage sales justice.  They always want to buy other people’s crap and I can’t very well tell them that it’s crap with the owner of said crap standing right there in front of us. And, what did C.J. just HAVE to have?  Out of everything spread on old, gross blankets on the dirty, cracking driveways?  This book. For Better or Best: Understand Your Man by Gary Smalley. I tried to steer him towards something a little more age-appropriate.  He wasn’t having it.  I tried to steer him towards any other book.  Nope, not interested. He can’t read.  Obviously.  So, why does he like this book so much?  He tells me that he likes to look at the numbers; and, by numbers he means words.  The book has gone everywhere with C.J.: to bed, to the bathroom, in the car, to Nana Grab Bag’s house, to Target, everywhere. There’s no telling why kids like certain things, especially C.J.  I guess I should look on the bright side, the back cover explains that after reading the book he will “understand not only the way men think, but also how to move a man’s heart.”
