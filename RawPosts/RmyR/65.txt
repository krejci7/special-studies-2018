Chase tries to plan a \u201cMovie Night Sleepover\u201d once every month or two. Last week, the event included two of his best buddies, a soak in the spa, pizza, a viewing of the movie Elf and video games. When we first discovered that C.J. was gender nonconforming, we\u2019d hide all of the \u201cgirl stuff\u201d in our house when Chase had a friend over. A year or two later we refused to hide the \u201cgirl stuff\u201d because of what that was teaching our boys, so we would ask Chase if his friends who were coming over knew that C.J. was gender nonconforming \u2013 giving Chase the option of telling them beforehand. Now, we don\u2019t bother with any of that. We just answer questions as they come from new guests in our house \u2013 surprisingly, few have any questions. The evening of Chase\u2019s sleepover, his two friends arrived and changed into their trunks to head for the spa. They were putting their clothes in their backpacks and grabbing their towels when C.J. ran down the stairs wearing his favorite swimsuit \u2013 the one covered in rainbows and kittens \u2014 yelling \u201cBoys! Here I come! I\u2019m ready!\u201d Chase\u2019s friends chuckled and Chase looked at me annoyed and worried that I\u2019d let C.J. join them in the spa \u2013 where C.J. likes to wear his huge pink snorkel goggles and play with his Little Mermaid doll. When I informed C.J. that he wasn\u2019t going in the spa, but was going with me to pick up the pizzas instead, he was not thrilled. After they ate a massive amount of pizza, Chase and his friends changed into their loungewear to settle in and watch (talk loudly through) the movie. C.J. promptly ran upstairs and threw on the white, faux-minx robe that he inherited from Nana \u2014 which he likes to put on at night after his warm bath and after applying his leave-in conditioner and throwing his hair up in a French twist. C.J. came flowing into the room like an old-timey movie star in his robe carrying his monster high pillow. He was ready to claim his space on the couch and enjoy his favorite mango green tea in his Frozen cup. Chase\u2019s friends gave the same chuckle and Chase gave the same annoyed looked. \u201cC.J., you aren\u2019t going to watch the movie with the guys,\u201d I said as they all stared. \u201cWhy? It\u2019s not inappropriate for me! I\u2019ve already seen it!\u201d he declared dramatically. Lucky for me (and Chase) I had just purchased Disney\u2019s Inside Out as a surprise for C.J. to watch while we snuggled and ate popcorn in my bed upstairs. After the movie, Chase and his friends retreated to his room to play video games for a bit. Lots of yelling, banging around and falling ensued behind Chase\u2019s closed door. Apparently that\u2019s how middle school boys play video games. C.J. kept sneaking to Chase\u2019s door and I caught him writing notes on his favorite fluorescent pink notepad and pushing them under the door. I could only imagine what he was writing. I told him to stop annoying Chase and his friends and knocked on Chase\u2019s door to retrieve the notes. Even my imagination couldn\u2019t have dreamed up the messages C.J. felt instinctively compelled to send to middle school boys to coax them into interacting with him. Adele lyrics.  \u201cWhat did your friends think of C.J.\u2019s rainbow kitty swimsuit, fancy bathrobe and Adele lyrics last night?\u201d I asked Chase the next day. \u201cNothing. They have annoying little brothers and sisters, too,\u201d Chase said. And that made me happy. C.J. wasn\u2019t annoying because his gender expression is embarrassing to Chase. He\u2019s annoying because all younger siblings are annoying to their older siblings. * * * We\u2019ve been Upworthy-ed!
