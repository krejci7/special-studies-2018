 “Do you have anything for me to do?” C.J. asked me in a moment of boredom. He knows that if he complains that he’s bored I’ll tell him that only boring people can be bored and he’d rather be a lot of things than a boring person. So, in honor of the Thanksgiving holiday, I had him make a list of the things he is thankful for from A to Z. He included some things that Chase should be thankful for and failed to mention that he was thankful for his mom or dad — proving that parenting is a thankless job. Things I Am Thankful For By: C.J., age 8 I am thankful for: Art and Andy Warhol Baby smells (but not bees) Cupcakes and Colorado Doctors and dolls Electricity Flowers (the video game Fallout 4 for Chase) Gogo boots and gummy bears Home (the song Hotline Bling for Chase) iPhones, because I want one Jeggings Knock knock jokes Late nights Mashed potatoes and makeup and me Night-lights Oranges Pinocchio and puzzles Queens (like the Queen of England but I like Princess Kate better) Rainbow Brite Sunsets and smiles Typing sounds mom makes on her computer and trampolines Unicorns Velvet Wishes and water and wigs Texting, because it has an x in it The letter y (It’s cute and I can’t think of anything else) Zebra print
