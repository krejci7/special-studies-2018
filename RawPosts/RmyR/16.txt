Click here for all of the months\u2019 pictures, thoughts and happenings. If you\u2019re on Instagram, follow me. If you already follow me, thanks! C.J. leaves this message wherever he can. Here, he wrote it in chalk on the floor of a busy restaurant that encourages patrons of all ages to draw on the floor. Every time he leaves his \u201cbe yourself\u201d message out in public, part of me thinks that someone who needs the message will happen upon it after we leave. But, most of all, I hope that C.J. always feels pride when it comes to the things that make him different and that he\u2019ll always feel brave enough to be himself. \u00a0 With no summer camp this week, my son has spent a lot of time drawing his favorite superheroes. \u00a0 Serving everyone the \u201cPride Eye.\u201d According to C.J., his \u201cPride Eye\u201d look is inspired by the colors he saw at Pride this year, cotton candy, unicorns, love and happiness. \u00a0 Sometimes, to celebrate the end of a rough week, you find the closest Pride, buy two train tickets, travel two hours and then\u2026you march. \u00a0 \u201cWhat should I do now?,\u201d C.J. asks at least once a day because he knows if he tells me he\u2019s bored I\u2019ll tell him only boring people can be bored. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sew something? The machine is out,\u201d I said the other day. At age 10, he knows his way around the machine just as well as I do. He made this skirt in an afternoon. \u00a0 This week C.J. added contortionist to the list of things he wants to be when he grows up. We encourage and empower young girls. We tell them they can be whatever they want to be when they grow up. Make sure we do the same for boys. C.J.\u2019s list of future professions includes: artist, makeup artist, drag queen, Olympic gymnast, hair stylist, contortionist, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race judge, AGT judge, Cupcake Wars judge. \u00a0 It\u2019s C.J.\u2019s last day of sewing camp. He made lots of friends and lots of drag queens. Here\u2019s his felt Sasha Velour. The employees at our local Joann\u2019s Store were so supportive and encouraging of C.J. \u2013 who was the only boy enrolled in sewing camp. They told him that they see a future for him on Project Runway. They were even more complimentary of Matt, who took C.J. into the store an hour before each day of camp to pick out new fabric, notions and patterns. \u201cIt\u2019s so great to see a dad in here buying fabric for his son and encouraging him to sew. A lot of dads wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d they said to Matt. They\u2019re right and I\u2019m glad they gave Matt the kudos he deserves. He\u2019s the best dad. (But, this also got me thinking, how come I\u2019ve been celebrated for taking Chase shopping at a sporting goods store?) \u00a0 I spoke at Aetna today about raising a gender creative child. The Q&A session that followed was the most emotional I\u2019ve experienced in a while. It was a reminder that you never know what the other people in the room or your co-workers are going through. Be nice to people, listen and practice empathy. \u00a0 This week C.J. is the only boy at sewing camp. He\u2019s also the only one who made a Violet Chachki hand puppet. \u00a0 Yesterday I spent the afternoon speaking at the Orange County Bar Association about raising a gender creative child and provided thoughts and guidance for interacting with children of all gender identities and expressions. What a great group of caring and inquisitive people! \u00a0 C.J.\u2019s perfect summer day includes having his three best girl friends over to jump on the trampoline, swim and do makeup. \u201cLet me show you a trick I learned from drag queens,\u201d I heard him say several times during their makeup session. \u00a0 I was cooking dinner and noticed I was all alone downstairs and the house had grown very quiet. Then, Matt texted me this pic from upstairs. C.J. had been doing makeup all weekend. Just when he thought he was running out of willing faces, he asked Matt. And, Matt said yes. Like he always does. \u00a0 And, yes, I absolutely did immediately come to the defense of women everywhere and make it very clear that women are strong and fierce protectors. It didn\u2019t matter. He still wants a husband instead of a wife. # # #   ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
