In the past, when a family has contacted me asking if I know of anybody in their area to meet up with, I put a call out on my blog and social media.\u00a0 (Are you following me on Facebook and Twitter?\u00a0 You should be.\u00a0 You\u2019re missing important posts like this and thoughts from C.J.).\u00a0 Sometimes my calls are answered by families close to the original family.\u00a0 I get permission from both families to share their email address and first name and, then, I make a e-introduction and tell them to have fun, respect each other\u2019s anonymity and let me know how things go. I\u2019ve done this for families in:  California Canada Georgia Hong Kong Illinois Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Ohio Oregon Philadelphia New Jersey New York Washington  I\u2019m getting more of these requests and I want to help.\u00a0 But, how do I do it?\u00a0 The same way I have been?\u00a0 Set up a separate page on this site?\u00a0 How much work and liability do I assume?\u00a0 How do I manage something that could take on a life of its own?\u00a0 Do you know of anybody already providing this service who I can point interested parties to? I see a void and want to fill it, but how?\u00a0 Your suggestions are greatly appreciated.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
