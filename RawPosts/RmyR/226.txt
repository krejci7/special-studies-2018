 Dear Mr. Dan Cathy, My uncle is gay.  I love my uncle and his boyfriend and all of his friends. We have fun and hangout. I don’t think it is right for you to give money to stop my uncle from getting married. People who are gay are humans just like us. They are not different in any way.  They are just people who want to be in love and get married to people of the same sex.  I feel sad for my uncle because he should have the same rights as me. This is just like when black people didn’t have the same rights as white people. They were born the way they were born and should have the same rights as us. This is why I think you should stop all this nonsense.  Gay people should be treated with equal rights. I’m going to tell other people that they shouldn’t eat at Chick-Fil-A. I can’t believe you said the things you said, because you say you are a Christian and you are supposed to act rightful and respectful and not say that people aren’t created equal. Especially gays and lesbians.  I’m a Christian too. When you say mean things, gay people get their feelings hurt and when that happens Jesus wishes he could do something to help them. Like make a miracle. When you get to heaven I think that Jesus will say “you made the wrong decision, man.” I used to eat at Chick-Fil-A a lot and now I don’t want to eat there until gay people win in the end.  Now I’m going to eat at subway. It’s healthier anyway. Sincerely, C.J.’s Brother, Age 9 Orange County, Calif. Former Chick-Fil-A Foothill Ranch Customer
