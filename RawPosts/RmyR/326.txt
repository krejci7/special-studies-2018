Any-who, Nana Grab Bags is happy to accommodate and fulfill Pa\u2019s fantasies of an over-the-top birthday because she is obsessed with holidays, fanfare and all things celebratory. A 63rdbirthday and what does Pa get?\u00a0 Dinner at Red Robin, a carousel ride, a homemade cake, Paul Frank themed party supplies and goody bags for everyone. Yes, goody bags. And, in those goody bags, among other things?\u00a0 Toe rings.\u00a0 Yes, ladies and gentlemen, toe rings for Pa\u2019s 63rdbirthday.\u00a0 Flower-shaped, bedazzled toe rings. Why must Nana Grab Bags do this to me?\u00a0 Why must she buy trinkets under the ruse that I might like them when really she knows C.J. will go bananas for them?\u00a0 Because boy did he. Next thing you know, Nana Grab Bags is calling the family to gather round for a rousing rendition of Happy Birthday to Pa and C.J. hollers\u2026. \u201cJus\u2019 a mimute, I\u2019s gotta put my toe rings on.\u201d The music stops.\u00a0 Macho, Mexican-American, born-again-Christian Pa takes a deep breath and steadies himself on the counter.\u00a0 We all wait in awkward silence for C.J. to get his toe rings on.\u00a0 And, then, we break into song.  \u00a0  C.J. hearts his new toe rings and is secretly praying for sandal weather. \u00a0    ", "feedtitle": "Page 33 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
