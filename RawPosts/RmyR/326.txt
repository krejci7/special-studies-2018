 My last blog post made me – again – consider this question….. If homosexuality could be detected during pregnancy through routine blood work or standard ultrasound, what percentage of people would want to know?  What percentage of people would abort? I’d want to know because lord knows I’m a planner.  I was the first to want to go to Organic Gender in Riverview, Florida to find C.J.s gender.  I generally don’t like surprises, unless they are lavish gifts being showered on me with no strings attached (I also don’t like strings attached).  Other than that, I always want to know what’s coming my way.  I need a plan of attack.  Constantly. That’s what’s so hard about raising C.J. — because I want to know right now if he is gay.  And, I can’t know that now and I most likely have more than a decade of not knowing.  It will be years before I have answers to some of my most important questions I have about him.  Do I need to preregister him at the performing arts high school?  Do I need to look into homeschooling or online coursework to protect him from bullies? Should he graduate early from high school to head to the Paul Mitchell Schools or audition for The Groundlings?  Should I be putting my preschooler on the waitlist at Parsons The New School for Design? I’m neurotic.  I know. That’s one of the many, many fabulous things about C.J., he’s teaching me to be more patient than I’m generally programmed to be. And, so is this blog.  Thanks to the more than 1,000 people who have read my words so far.  RaisingMyRainbow is on Facebook now (look at C.J.’s Mom getting all social media on you).  Find me.  Like me.  Muah.
