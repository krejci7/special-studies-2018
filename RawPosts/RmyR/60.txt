C.J.! At the very top of his birthday wish list are:  All of the mannequins from the front window of the Dior store at South Coast Plaza. A pink diamond pendant necklace from Tiffany. MAC lip pencil in \u201cTease Me\u201d pink. MAC lip pencil in \u201cHip N Happy\u201d pink. Hand-painted, eerily-lifelike baby dolls.

Oh how things change and evolve with the passing of time and\u00a0 personal growth. Matt and I can\u2019t wait for C.J.\u2019s \u201cMake My Birthday A Masterpiece\u201d rainbow art party, when all of his best girl friends will gather around the table for an art lesson and rainbow cupcakes.
