FYI, C.J. really wants this for Christmas. In case you were wondering what to get him. Pardon me for being a bit of a flakey, unorganized blogger during this holiday season.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been very busy managing C.J.\u2019s Christmas expectations.\u00a0 You see, when he was finished composing it, his wish list was two pages long, front and back, single-spaced with half-inch margins.\u00a0 He was under the impression that everything that he put on his list would appear under the tree on Christmas morning.\u00a0 I had to explain how a wish list differed from an order form.\u00a0 I felt like Scrooge. Anyway, let\u2019s get down to business\u2026 Things that caught my attention recently: Move over Toemaggedon!\u00a0 It\u2019s time for Shoemaggedon!\u00a0 Yay! Photograph Of Little Boy Wearing Pink Shoes To Preschool Sparks Heated Blogosphere Debate, Huffington Post, 12/11/12 \u201cA viral photograph of a young boy who opted to wear pink shoes on his first day of preschool has sparked intense debate in the blogosphere.\u201d Read what one disapproving blogger wrote about the mother who dared to let her son wear (gasp!) pink zebra-print shoes to school. \u00a0 My son wears these shoes..and leg warmers, Tinkerbell socks, jean skirt, infinity scarf.. Mom Who Let Son Wear Pink Shoes to Preschool Was Asking for Controversy, TheStir.com, 12/10/12 \u00a0 \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but feel kind of bad for the poor kid.\u00a0 Because\u2026(he) wound up with people whispering behind his back and making nasty remarks about him. And for those exact reasons\u2026I wouldn\u2019t let my own son wear a pair of pink shoes to school. Because at only 6 years old and being in the first grade, I\u2019m just not sure it\u2019s fair to subject him to being bullied or treated unfairly all because most people associate pink with girls and blue with boys.\u201d\u00a0 The author of that blog post would hate my way of parenting.\u00a0 For sure.\u00a0 That\u2019s okay, unlike that blogger, I would never ask my children to hide their likes just because they might be disliked by others.\u00a0 The \u201che\u2019s got to man up\u201d and \u201cwell, he\u2019s gotta learn sometime\u201d and \u201cwhat did he expect?\u201d attitudes of years bygone are harmful to the child who\u2019s different.\u00a0 I hope more people start to realize that. They.\u00a0 Are.\u00a0 Just.\u00a0 Shoes.\u00a0 And, you know what?\u00a0 There are kids in this world with no shoes at all. C.J. on his way to a holiday play. Sometimes it catches me off guard when he looks so masculine. Not last blog post but the one before, I announced a giveaway and called for entries.\u00a0 The winner gets THE ADVENTURES OF TULIP, BIRTHDAY WISH FAIRY and BACKWARDS DAY \u2014 two children\u2019s books written for gender-independent kids and families. And the winner is\u2026.Emily (who commented on 11/22 at 4:04 a.m.).\u00a0 Hi Emily, I\u2019ll email you, check your inbox. The final post of the year will be up next week! Cheers, C.J.\u2019s Mom \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 22 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
