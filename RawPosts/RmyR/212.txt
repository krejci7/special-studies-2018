If there was ever a day in history where people who love and advocate for children should come together and shout from the tops of mountains to \u201clet kids be kids\u201d it would be today. If there was ever a day to step back and look with wonder at our children for the joyfully imaginative way they approach their lives it would be today. If there was ever a day to stop and say we only have today, what a gift I have in my son or daughter, I will not let anyone or anything stand in the way of what makes them happy it would be today. I don\u2019t mean to co-op one tragedy to pontificate about another. I only mean to suggest that life is fragile, unpredictable and beautiful. To wring hands and gnash teeth over pink zebra striped flats is such a waste. Such a terrible, painful waste. Tomorrow morning 20 moms and dads will wake up with out little feet to put in shoes. I don\u2019t know what to be more broken about\u2026the senseless deaths of 20 beautiful children or scandalous flats on a beautiful little boy! God bless you and your family! Auntie Mip This was a comment I received in response to my last blog post and the Newton school shootings. \u00a0I was planning on writing similar thoughts to post, but I feel like this Raising My Rainbow commenter said it better than I would have. C.J. is in kindergarten and I can\u2019t stop picturing him and his classmates when I think about the tragedy that happened in Newton. \u00a0Some people spend so much time and negative energy \u00a0judging him and us because he likes to play with \u201cgirl toys,\u201d wear \u201cgirl clothes\u201d and be treated like a girl. \u00a0But, you know what? \u00a0He is here, he is happy and he is healthy. \u00a0The parents of the 20 children (and the adults) killed yesterday can not say the same. \u00a0People would rather trade parenting places me over the parents of the Newton school shooting victims without thought. It should puts things into perspective for people. \u00a0I hope it does. \u00a0As I put him to bed last night I whispered into C.J.\u2019s ear, as I do every night, \u201cI love you no matter what.\u201d \u00a0I hugged him a little longer and thanked the universe that he was still breathing in his room\u2026in his Disney Princess nightgown, cradling his Barbie. \u00a0      ", "feedtitle": "Page 22 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
