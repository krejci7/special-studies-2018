Among the many things that I am grateful for are this blog and its readers.\u00a0 C.J.\u2019s Brother is thankful for his family, his house and his video games. C.J. is thankful for his dolls, his grandma and grandpa, his other grandma and grandpa and lights so he doesn\u2019t fall down in the dark\u2026especially when he is wearing high heels. C.J.\u2019s sassy turkey.We are also thankful for the families with gender nonconforming and LGBTQ kids who we have had the pleasure of getting to know over the last two years. I\u2019ve had a few families contact me recently asking for help in finding gender nonconforming families in their area.\u00a0 So, if your child is gender nonconforming or LGBTQ and you live in Western Massachusetts or the greater Seattle area of Washington, please email me at raisingmyrainbow@gmail.com so that I can set you up on a potential playdate. I want to start helping more families connect, so if you are looking for another gender nonconforming family in your area, please email me with your location so that I can get to work.\u00a0 This could be fun; I just have to figure out how to do it in a way that is safe and secure for everybody.\u00a0 My wheels are turning. Now, it\u2019s time for a giveaway!\u00a0 I recently read two children\u2019s books that were written for gender-independent kids and families that some of you may enjoy. THE ADVENTURES OF TULIP, BIRTHDAY WISH FAIRY follows title-character Tulip as he deals with the birthday wishes of all the nine-year-olds in North America. Tulip receives a wish from a child known as David who wishes to live as Daniela. He doesn\u2019t understand how to help, so he seeks the wise counsel of the Wish Fairy Captain and learns some new Wish Fairy Skills (while also introducing the concept of trans-identified children in a friendly, sympathetic way). BACKWARDS DAY, set on the planet Tenalp, introduces us to a world where there are seventeen seasons, including one where bubblegum falls from the sky for three days and a single day when everything \u2013 everything everywhere \u2013 is backwards. Andrea looks eagerly forward to Backwards Day every year, so she can turn into a boy for the day. But one year she doesn\u2019t turn along with everyone else. She\u2019s miserable. The very next day, however, she turns into a boy \u2013 and stays that way! To enter to win one copy of each book, leave a comment at the end of this post letting me know which gender or LGBTQ organization(s) you are most thankful for.\u00a0 A winner will be selected randomly by C.J. And, finally, I try to stay on topic here, as much as I struggle to do so in real life.\u00a0 But, allow me to digress for a moment.\u00a0 I was recently sent a link to Neil Patrick Harris\u2019s new web series titled \u201cNeil\u2019s Puppet Dreams.\u201d\u00a0 Neil Patrick Harris and The Jim Henson Company together?\u00a0 Please, what could be better?\u00a0 This is going to be huge.\u00a0 Watch it\u2026.but not with the kids around.  \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 22 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
