It\u2019s been a while! C.J. had a case of pneumonia (bless his heart)\u00a0that WOULD.\u00a0 NOT.\u00a0 GO.\u00a0 AWAY.\u00a0 Several trips to the hospital and several rounds of different medications and he finally kicked the thing right as Grandma and Grandpa Colorado arrived (bless their hearts)\u00a0to watch the kids for a week while Matt and I vacationed in Panama (bless our hearts). So, that\u2019s where I\u2019ve been and, now, I\u2019m back. Following are the things that have caught and held my attention recently. Enjoy! \u00a0More soon\u2026 * * * As many of you know, one of my badass besties is Sarah at NerdyApple.com. Her oldest child goes to school with a boy named Morgan who celebrated his 17th birthday one week ago by wearing a shrug, lace gloves and fashion belt to school. Well, the administrators at his school didn\u2019t respond well (to put it mildly) and, now, Morgan and his family have inspired the #clothinghasnogender movement.\u00a0 Read more here. \u00a0Morgan, if you or your mom read this, you should contact Sarah cause she\u2019s awesome and her and her family will stand by you until the end. * * * Meet the New Generation of Gender-Creative Kids, TIME.com Lindsay Morris photographs a rural retreat where kids are free to be themselves. These pictures make me smile. * * * Transgender Students Learn To Navigate School Halls, NPR.org I love this piece written with such heart by a high schooler about her classmate and friend who is transgender. Bravo to the author, her friend and open-minded, open-hearted high school students everywhere. * * * \u2018Sanctuary Palm Springs\u2019 to create haven for LGBT youth, DesertSun.com A Palm Springs couple is set to open a foster home for LGBT youth. Nearly 20 percent of foster youth in their area identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. They\u2019ve found themselves homeless after coming out to family or being bullied at school. About 26 percent of LGBT youth say their biggest problems are not feeling accepted by family, trouble at school or bullying and a fear to be out, according to the Human Rights Campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re calling this not a group home but an LGBT family home. Because many people, when they come out as LGBT, they lose their family,\u201d the couple said.\u00a0The home will operate as a nonprofit and\u00a0provide basic necessities such as food, clothing and medical care, along with\u00a0mentoring, career advice and life coaching, a range of artistic activities, therapy with local professionals and enough responsibilities to become self-sufficient. * * * It\u2019s time to start thinking about summer camp!\u00a0 If you have a transgender or gender nonconforming child, check out Camp Aranu\u2019tiq.\u00a0 If your family has LGBTQ parents, consider attending Harbor Camps LGBTQ Family Camp.
