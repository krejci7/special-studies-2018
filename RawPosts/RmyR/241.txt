It\u2019s the first professional development curriculum course of its kind for education professionals and CSUF is the only university to offer a course like this for credit (read: taking this course may up a teacher\u2019s salary).\u00a0 Better yet?\u00a0 It\u2019s headed up by Karyl Ketchum.\u00a0 Google her.\u00a0 Ketchum is an anti-bullying superhero who I\u2019ve seen at work firsthand.\u00a0 Girlfriend is fierce.\u00a0 Trust. Know a teacher, school administrator, staff member, district official or school board member in California?\u00a0 If so, please, please, please have them check out this course that they can easily take over summer vacay and be ready to start implementing by the 2012/2013 school year.\u00a0 The fate of kids like C.J. may depend on it. http://extension.fullerton.edu/bullying/ 2.)\u00a0Thanks to Raising My Rainbow super-fan Tina who, after reading last week\u2019s post, sent me a link to the most fabulous free Disney paper dolls.\u00a0 The doll is Kate Middleton and her options for clothing are all infamous gowns worn by Disney Princesses.\u00a0 C.J. played with Kate and her Disney dresses long enough for me to make dinner and do the laundry uninterrupted\u2026that\u2019s like two weeks in mom-years. \u201cKate Middleton\u2019s dress designer is a royally guarded secret, but just imagine if she could walk down the aisle in a dress designed by Disney! Your tea party guests will have a ball fitting Kate into the Disney Princess\u2019 famed frocks, from Cinderella\u2019s wedding gown to Aurora\u2019s twirling pink confection.\u201d http://family.go.com/printables/article-1001999-princess-kate-paper-doll-t/?cmp=SMC-FB_Fcom_%5Bkate_printables%5D_%5Bdisney%5D_%5BFamily.com 3.)\u00a0People ask me for resources for raising gender creative kids a lot.\u00a0 I usually have to send a sloppy list of sites and books and articles that have helped me along the way.\u00a0 Then, this popped into my inbox: http://libguides.bankstreet.edu/transchildren It\u2019s a research guide that has been created at Bank Street College Library titled \u201cResources for Families of Gender Variant and Transgender Children.\u201d\u00a0 Little did they know that they just made my life a little easier.\u00a0 Stop by and check it out.\u00a0 It\u2019s a work in progress and they are open to suggestions and feedback. 4.) \u00a0After my post about those stupid Twitter homophobes, I learned about\u00a0anotetomykid.com.\u00a0 A Note to My Kid gives the LGBTQ community, their parents, family and friends the opportunity to share their unconditional love with one another through open letters and it reminds members of the LGBTQ community that there is a lot of love and support out there.\u00a0 Check it out, I did and got so involved reading that I was nearly late to pick up C.J. from school. 5.) \u00a0Some people are still pissed that I don\u2019t show any of our faces on the blog.\u00a0 Some people are so used to it that they have forgotten that we actually have faces.\u00a0 At any rate, if you want to follow \u2013 through photos \u2014 a family raising a gender creative child you should check out www.hesparkles.wordpress.com.\u00a0 The mom is an amazing photographer.\u00a0 That\u2019s another reason why I don\u2019t include more/better photos.\u00a0 I know a good photo when I see it, I just can\u2019t take one.\u00a0 If I want to produce a reasonably-eye-pleasing-photograph I have to use Hipstamatic on my phone.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t even ventured into the Instagram world yet, much to Uncle Uncle\u2019s embarrassment.\u00a0 I digress, cheers to Noah and his mom.\u00a0 We love boys who sparkle. 6.)\u00a0What I\u2019m reading this week (or read recently and the weeks are blending together): A Teen\u2019s Brave Response to \u201cI\u2019m Christian, Unless You\u2019re Gay\u201d on Single Dad Laughing A Father\u2019s Reaction to His Very Young Gay Son on Huffington Post 7.)\u00a0Bravo to you if you just read all of that.\u00a0 With all of that \u201cbusiness\u201d out of the way, a new post is coming soon.
