Yesterday afternoon she arrived at our house with two Easter baskets overflowing with ridiculousness, one for C.J. and one for his brother.\u00a0 C.J.\u2019s basket had more chocolate than the city of Hershey, Penn.; colored bubbles that, I\u2019ve been warned, stain; a Little Mermaid kite; toys for summer; and a Ken doll.\u00a0 How could she. Handsome Ken doll comes casually dressed in jeans, pink plaid shirt and a grey tee. When C.J. caught a glimpse of the familiarly-shaped pink box buried in the basket, he got excited.\u00a0 His excitement was premature.\u00a0 He pulled the box out and his smile quickly turned into a hard straight line.\u00a0 \u201cNana, what is \u2018dis?\u201d he asked with attitude and his head cocked, knowing full well what \u201cit\u201d was. \u201cThat\u2019s Ken,\u201d said Nana, exuberant as always. \u201cI don\u2019t like Ken. I like Barbie,\u201d C.J. insisted. Poor Nana Grab Bags.\u00a0 She tried.\u00a0 She tried to see if C.J. could like a Ken doll as much as he likes Barbie.\u00a0 If maybe Ken could be a gateway drug into the dirty world of boy toys, much like Barbie was a gateway drug into the fabulous world of girl toys.\u00a0 Not that Nana Grab Bags really cares.\u00a0 Well, C.J. was offended. C.J. continued to look at Ken with confusion and disgust.\u00a0 I would have the same reaction if someone gave me an auto part, chess set or computer manual.\u00a0 I encouraged C.J. to be thankful, but he was so flabbergasted by the gift choice that he couldn\u2019t play nice.\u00a0 Kids are so lucky that they don\u2019t have to pretend.\u00a0 According to C.J., the gift sucked and he couldn\u2019t help but let Nana know it. It wasn\u2019t just any Ken doll.\u00a0 It was Shaving Fun Ken.\u00a0 \u201cGirls can help Ken doll \"shave\" his facial hair!\u201d -- Mattel To add insult to injury, Nana Grab Bags bought Shaving Fun Ken two additional outfits; a pink tuxedo and an outfit for the beach.\u00a0 \u201cI thought you would have fun changing his clothes,\u201d she explained.\u00a0 C.J. said nothing; he just shook his head no. \u00a0C.J. loves to dress his Barbies and Disney Princesses, how could he refuse to dress and undress Ken? We all tried to stifle our laughter and smiles.\u00a0 It really was cute.\u00a0 C.J.\u2019s attitude is cute on a four-year-old.\u00a0 If you\u2019re older than four, don\u2019t try this at home, unless you\u2019re with your Nana.\u00a0 A good Nana will forgive just about anything, especially on Easter.
