He had eyed the ensemble at Target weeks ago and asked to wear it for Christmas Eve so he could take \u201cfancy pictures by the fireplace and the tree. I told him no.\u00a0 Not because the outfit was made for girls and he is a boy, but because had I bought it then he would have wanted to wear it immediately and often and when we finally sat down to Christmas Eve dinner it would have been thrashed. He talked about his \u201cChristmas outfit\u201d nonstop and asked everyday if it was time to go buy it. Today was the day.\u00a0 We got home and both ran up the stairs to my bedroom with its mirrored closets.\u00a0\u00a0 I sat on the floor removing price tags while he tore off his \u201cschool clothes,\u201d which he wears as a disguise when out in society so that people will think he is all boy.\u00a0 He wears \u201cschool clothes\u201d so that he won\u2019t get teased, have to sit by himself at the lunch tables and so he will get invites to birthday parties.\u00a0 More than anything he wants to be thought of as \u201cnormal.\u201d\u00a0 But, he\u2019s not. He closed his eyes as I put on the black bubble skirt covered in sequins, the red long sleeved t-shirt that says \u201cJOY\u201d on it in glitter and the black sequined vest.\u00a0 I spun him to the mirror.\u00a0 He opened his eyes, took himself in and then thanked me. My first reaction was to smile.\u00a0 He reminded me of when I was a little girl and wanted a show stopping dress for the holidays.\u00a0 My dresses were made of scratchy fabric that made noise when I moved.\u00a0 I wore white socks with lace trim and stiff, shiny Mary Janes.\u00a0 I learned at an early age that beauty is pain. My son looked sassy and beautiful.\u00a0 He looked natural, happy and truly comfortable for the first time that day.\u00a0 Then I felt pain.\u00a0 If the rest of the world could be more empathetic, accepting, welcoming and kind, my son could be this happy and comfortable all of the time \u2014 because then my son could be a boy who dresses like a girl and not have to think twice about it.\u00a0 The world isn\u2019t like that. Other people can\u2019t see the beauty in my son in a dress.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t always seen the beauty either.\u00a0 Two and a half years ago this scene from my life wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t have bought girl clothes for my son.\u00a0 Never.\u00a0 Ever.\u00a0 Back then, I felt uneasy when he played with Barbies. \u00a0When he tried to dress feminine, I\u2019d hand him his brother\u2019s masculine hand-me-downs and tell him to put them on.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t give him choices because I knew that his choices would be pink with sparkles and rhinestones.\u00a0 His choices would smell like the raspberry vanilla body spray he snuck from my bathroom and hid under his bed. Then I realized that my actions were telling him \u201cyou can\u2019t be you because I want you to be what society wants you to be.\u201d My husband and I changed the way we were parenting.\u00a0 There was something unique about our son that we could choose to support or destroy.\u00a0 We had to follow his lead.\u00a0 He led us to the pink aisles at Target; and, that\u2019s not a dangerous, harmful, unhealthy place for a boy to be. My son\u2019s Christmas dress is hanging in his closet.\u00a0 He checks on it before and after school and a few other times each day.\u00a0 On Christmas Eve, a dozen members of our family will gather around the table in honor of religious beliefs and to celebrate the passing of one year and the start of another.\u00a0 It will be the first holiday that my son will join us at the table dressed as a girl.\u00a0 We won\u2019t care.\u00a0 We will tell him that he is beautiful, inside and out.\u00a0 And, we\u2019ll mean it. Apparently C.J. thinks that two Barbies are better than three wise men. *This is my last blog post of the year.\u00a0 Holiday wishes and greetings to all of you! \u00a0Let\u2019s catch up in a few weeks.\u00a0 xoxo, C.J.\u2019s Mom\u00a0    ", "feedtitle": "Page 21 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
