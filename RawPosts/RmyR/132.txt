My youngest son is six years old and his life is divided into two parts: before Barbie and after Barbie. During the first two and a half years of his life, C.J. was largely underwhelmed buy the clothes and toys passed down from his older brother.\u00a0 Nothing seemed to excite him, until he discovered a new Barbie in the back of my closet.\u00a0 He insisted on opening the box and playing with her.\u00a0 By his third birthday he could name every Disney Princess and her movie of origin.\u00a0 Shortly thereafter he started dressing like a girl at home.\u00a0 \u00a0When he was old enough to explain himself, he told us that he is a boy who only likes girl things and wants to be treated like a girl. I wanted information about raising a child like mine \u2013 a little boy who was a girl at heart, with a penchant for pink, sparkles and everything fabulous \u2013 but couldn\u2019t find any.\u00a0 I searched for blogs.\u00a0 Nothing.\u00a0 I searched popular parenting sites.\u00a0 Nothing.\u00a0 I conducted countless, random Google searches.\u00a0 Nothing. I complained about the lack of information to my friends.\u00a0 They all agreed that I couldn\u2019t possibly be the only person cyber-searching and that I should start my own blog. After months of procrastination, I did it.\u00a0 RaisingMyRainbow.com went live in January 2011. My readers quickly educated me; they are the ones who taught me that my son is gender nonconforming.\u00a0 That was back when I had no idea what I was doing or what I was writing about.\u00a0 Now that I know a little more, I try to help the people who contact me with questions or concerns about raising a child who shuns traditional gender norms. Here are the things that I most often tell them: Chill out and give it some time.\u00a0 My husband and I have been there, in that early, panicked rush to figure out what was going on with our son and if he was going through a phase or if his behaviors had some deeper meaning.\u00a0 The only way to tell if something is a phase is to wait it out and patiently observe it.\u00a0 If the behaviors go on for an extended period of time your child may be gender nonconforming.\u00a0 My son has definitely taught me patience. Search out resources and funnel your energy into getting educated.\u00a0 Learn the distinct differences between sex, gender and sexuality.\u00a0 Sex is what\u2019s in your underwear that determines if you are male or female.\u00a0 Gender is what\u2019s in your brain that tells you if you are male or female.\u00a0 And sexuality is what\u2019s in your heart that tells you who you are attracted to.\u00a0 Read Diane Ehrensaft\u2019s Gender Born, Gender Made and my book Raising My Rainbow. \u00a0PFLAG and Gender Spectrum are amazing organizations and resources for families like ours.\u00a0 Support is out there, I promise. Ask yourself some tough questions and make decisions.\u00a0 \u00a0Is your job to love your child or change him? \u00a0Is your child free to be who he was created to be?\u00a0 Is there room for shame in childhood?\u00a0 Who are you working to make feel comfortable, your child or everyone else? \u00a0Will you be his first bully? This isn\u2019t about you so don\u2019t take it personal.\u00a0\u00a0 According to Gender Spectrum, significant gender variance or a transgender identity occurs in as many as one of every 500 births \u2013 making it more common than childhood diabetes. \u00a0A few months after C.J. found Barbie, I found the following quote: \u201cYou have to go the way your blood beats. If you don\u2019t live the only life you have, you won\u2019t live some other life, you won\u2019t live any life at all.\u201d\u00a0 I want my son to live a life.\u00a0 I have to let him go the way his blood beats. Gather a stellar supporting cast.\u00a0 Like any family raising a child with special or unique needs, you\u2019ll benefit from help.\u00a0 We\u2019d be lost without our family, friends, pediatrician, therapist and child advocate.\u00a0 Children like C.J. have the highest rate of suicide attempts in the world and are much more likely to suffer from major depressions, substance abuse and unsafe sexual behaviors.\u00a0 To raise a healthy gender nonconforming child, it\u2019s going to take more than one or two people. Don\u2019t forget the siblings. \u00a0Diane Ehrensaft recently said, \u201cIt takes a family to launch a gender nonconforming child, but that\u2019s not necessarily what a sibling wants to do or how they want to spend their time.\u00a0 Are we asking siblings to step outside their comfort zone and/or do too much?\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0Siblings have their own anxieties, confusions and vulnerabilities.\u00a0 They need empathy and support, too. Know your child\u2019s rights at school and know that their siblings are a protected as well.\u00a0\u00a0 We always expected that C.J. would be bullied and teased for his gender nonconformity, but we didn\u2019t anticipate that his older brother would have to endure it first.\u00a0 The Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Welcoming Schools program has a wealth of information, as does Gender Spectrum.\u00a0 Get yourself really familiar with Title IX and your state\u2019s safe school laws. Show your child examples of other kids like him.\u00a0 \u00a0We are lucky enough to be a part of a gender nonconforming playgroup.\u00a0 Every month or so, my son gets to play with a group of boys just like him.\u00a0 Not everyone is that lucky.\u00a0 Before we had our playgroup, we read lots of books about kids who are gender nonconforming or different from the norms of society.\u00a0 Our favorites are The Boy Who Cried Fabulous, A Fire Engine for Ruthie and anything else by Leslea Newman.\u00a0 We also love My Princess Boy by Cheryl Kilodavis and Roland Humphrey is Wearing a What? by Eileen Kiernan-Johnson.\u00a0 \u00a0Todd Parr books are great, too. Enjoy the path less traveled.\u00a0 You\u2019re not weird, you\u2019re different and if everybody were the same this world would be a very boring place.\u00a0 Paint nails, braid hair, tap dance, smile big. \u00a0We watch everybody stressing out to keep up with the Joneses as our son sketches a dress he wants to sew for himself.\u00a0 Then he takes a bath with strawberry scented soap and spritzes himself with raspberry-vanilla body spray before putting on his nightgown. Diane Ehrensaft has said, \u201cGender creative children are blessed with the ability to hold on to the concept \u2014 that we all had one time in our lives \u2014 that we were free to be anything we wanted \u2013 boy, girl, maybe both.\u201d Or son continues to hold on to the concept and he has retaught it to us as well.
