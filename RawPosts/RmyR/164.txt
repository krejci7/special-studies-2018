Change is difficult, or at least it is for me.\u00a0 I hate it when a website changes on me.\u00a0 Never fear, the functionality of the blog is largely the same and I\u2019m still working to make some updates.\u00a0\u00a0 I admit, I\u2019m no web designer or coder, so please bear with me. I\u2019ve also freshened up my Facebook and Twitter pages.\u00a0 I hope you like it all.\u00a0 My book\u2019s September 3 release date is getting closer and this is all part of the preparation process. * * * This week, instead of reading a post written by me, you have to read a post written by one of my best friends.\u00a0 I met her through my blog and she has an amazing gender creative son of her own. \u00a0After years of near-constant emails and texts, we met.\u00a0 And, so did her son Twirl and C.J.\u00a0 It was one of the best weekend\u2019s that we\u2019ve had in a long, long time.\u00a0 Read what happened here.  So if you follow along with Lori\u2019s blog Raising my Rainbow you know exactly who C.J. is. If you don\u2019t,\u00a0go there and follow. About 2 years ago a group of moms on the internet (think SuperFriends) all started writing to each other with a common bond: advocacy for our children. These women have become my best friends. Lori\u2019s son C.J. and my son Twirl lead very similar lives. As Cory and I would talk to Twirl about other boys like him I started showing him pics of C.J. Lori had sent me, as well as the ones on her blog. He instantly wanted to play with him. I had to explain how it wasn\u2019t possible at the moment because they actually live across the country. But, I said, you could send him an email and say hi, so that\u2019s just how the friendship started. C.J. and Twirl would send each other emails through our accounts with the cutest 3 sentence emails you have ever read. They talked about the things they loved to do, dressing up, fashion shows, favorite characters. They invited each other to do things like birthday parties but always ending with, \u201d but I know you can\u2019t since you don\u2019 t live here\u201d. One day Cory and I were talking about how some day we just had to get them together. And then one day I just texted Lori and said we are doing it, when can we come visit\u2026 * * * I have been nominated as one of Southern California\u2019s Top 25 Bloggers by Circle of Moms.
