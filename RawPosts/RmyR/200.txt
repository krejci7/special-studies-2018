Raising My Rainbow has been selected as a finalist in the 2013 Parents Blog Awards in the category of \u201cMost Likely to Inspire You to Change the World.\u201d Voting is super simple.\u00a0\u00a0Just click here\u00a0and select my blog under the\u00a0\u201cMost Likely to Inspire You to Change the World\u201d category. \u00a0You can vote once a day until Feb. 24. I would love to win this honor because\u00a0Parents Magazine\u00a0is one of the leading (if not the leading) parenting magazine in the U.S. and exposure to my blog would no doubt help some of their millions of readers better understand gender; consider their expectations for their child when it comes to gender, sex and sexuality; and hopefully encourage them to educate cisgender children to be more empathetic and kind towards LGBTQ children. A special thanks to the person or people who nominated me!\u00a0 I\u2019m flattered and grateful. * * * Last week may have been C.J.\u2019s birthday, but I\u2019m the one who received the most amazing gift! KidzCanDesign is a company that converts a child\u2019s work of art into custom, high quality, sterling silver jewelry.\u00a0 They took one of C.J.\u2019s self-portraits and turned it into a necklace that I will treasure forever. The self-portrait that they used was drawn by C.J. right as kindergarten started in September, right before he drew himself as a boy for the first time ever.\u00a0 So, the art is special to me and always will be.\u00a0 I can\u2019t get enough of this necklace. Check out KidzCanDesign and if you choose to order something use the promo code RAINBOW for 35 percent off of your order and free U.S. shipping. \u00a0You can also like them at Facebook/KidzCanDesign. * * * Finally, you all HAVE to watch this video. \u00a0The content, the way it is presented, artist iO Tillett Wright\u2019s delivery, intelligence, compassion\u2026.I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\u00a0 I\u2019m fascinated by iO Tillett Wright\u2019s gender nonconforming childhood. \u201cI grew up in a very sheltered environment. I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s \u2026 Where I come from, if you weren\u2019t a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind, you were the weirdo.\u201d \u201ciO Tillett Wright thanks her parents for not asking her to define herself as a child. Her experience of growing up without having check boxes like \u201cfemale,\u201d \u201cmale,\u201d \u201cgay\u201d or straight\u201d thoroughly infuses her art.\u201d    ", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
