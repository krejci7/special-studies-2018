I\u2019m not one of those mommy bloggers who uses a fancy DSLR camera with a snazzy homemade strap cover to capture vivid, crisp pictures of our daily, quirky lives. I take photos with my phone. And sometimes when I have an extra moment or two in between laundry, dishes, homework and RHBH, I use my $2.99 Photoshop app to gussy them up for your viewing pleasure. All that being the case, I have to make an effort to get frame-worthy pictures taken of my boys at least once a year. I usually try to use some random local photographer at the suggestion of some random local friend.\u00a0 Said photographer tries to do something \u201cartistic\u201d or \u201cphotojournalistic\u201d to \u201ccapture the moments in life to treasure forever\u201d or something like that.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done it barefoot on the beach in Laguna and dressed in layers on train tracks in San Juan Capistrano \u2013 just like every other family in South Orange County. A few weeks ago I received a coupon from the local portrait studio advertising a Children\u2019s Portrait Sale \u2014 a photo session, 8\u00d710, two 3x5s and eight wallets for $39.95.\u00a0 They said it was a $222 value.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t necessarily believe them, but I booked a studio session anyway. I put the boys in coordinating outfits and off we went to the first appointment on a Saturday morning. We were greeted by a photographer who looked to be in her mid-twenties.\u00a0 She had pale porcelain skin and jet black hair that she wore in the same style as Dora The Explorer.\u00a0 She had matte red lips and a high-pitched voice. She walked us the studio and got the boys situated under the hot, bright lights and spacey looking reflectors.\u00a0 The boys were all straight-faced. \u201cAm I going to have to make you smile?\u201d she teased, putting her hands on her hips. She got out a tennis ball with a silly face drawn on it and held it above the camera.\u00a0 The boys smiled slightly, but it felt forced. \u201cOkay, now picture your dad wearing a dress!\u201d she exclaimed. Holy shit!\u00a0 Where did that come from?\u00a0 Did she really just say that?\u00a0 What the hell just happened? The eyes of both boys darted right to mine.\u00a0 The forced smiles flew away instantly.\u00a0 In our family we don\u2019t joke about gender presentation. It\u2019s not funny.\u00a0 I never realized how much my boys have picked up on that until that moment in the photographer\u2019s studio.\u00a0 I stared at my boys and they stared at me. The photographer, realizing that her joke had left her audience unamused, pulled another funny quip out of her arsenal.\u00a0 It must have worked, because she managed to get a few good shots of the boys together. Then it was time for the individual shots.\u00a0 C.J.\u2019s Brother was up first. \u201cNow, picture your brother wearing a dress,\u201d she said with a giggle. \u201cI don\u2019t have to picture that.\u00a0 I see it everyday.\u00a0 I saw it this morning,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Brother shot back making unwavering eye contact with her. C.J was staring nervously at me and wringing his fingers. I was speechless.\u00a0 I was pissed at the photographer for making fun of gender presentation and being so presumptuous. \u00a0I was proud of C.J.\u2019s Brother for taking a stand.\u00a0 I was worried that the scene would bother C.J.\u00a0 I was upset with myself for not paying attention during high school photography class so that I wouldn\u2019t have to submit my kids to this kind of awkwardness.\u00a0 I wish I could take my own damn pictures. The photographer moved on to another of her one-liners and snapped away.\u00a0 There was a tension in the room.\u00a0 You can see it in the individual pictures of the boys.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t order any of those. \u201cYou both looked very handsome in the pictures,\u201d I said to the boys during lunch that afternoon. \u201cThanks,\u201d they said in unison as they colored their kids\u2019 menus. \u201cThat lady wasn\u2019t very funny,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Brother said without looking up. \u201cNo, she wasn\u2019t.\u00a0 Some people have different senses of humor,\u201d I said, choosing my words wisely.\u00a0 \u201cI think you handled the situation perfectly.\u201d \u201cThanks, so did you,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Brother said with a sly smile, eyes focused as he connected the dots on his menu to reveal a hamburger. I smiled.\u00a0 We all handled that situation pretty well.\u00a0 A lot of times, because of C.J.\u2019s gender nonconformity, I never know how things will happen and what our reactions will be.\u00a0 More and more, over the course of the past three years, I\u2019ve gotten comfortable with trusting that it\u2019s all going to turn out okay.
