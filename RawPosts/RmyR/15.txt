The adults are typically stressed, confused, lonely and scared. I get it. I\u2019ve been there. Ages four and five were the toughest for us in terms of parenting a gender expansive child. I tell families that it gets better once the child can communicate his/her thoughts and feelings. Like, now, with C.J. being 10 years old and getting ready to start fifth grade, if I have a question about him, I can ask him and he can answer. I asked C.J. what he remembers thinking and feeling when he was four and five years old and I wrote it all down. I\u2019m hoping that sharing C.J.\u2019s memories below might help families currently wondering and/or struggling. xoxo, Lori (By: C.J., age 10, August 2017) When I was two years old I kind of liked cars and knights and stuff because that\u2019s all the toys we had. When I got closer to three years old, I started to like pink, purple and princesses. By the time I was four years old, I liked everything girl stuff. I really liked the way girls\u2019 hair and dresses moved. In preschool and kindergarten, I got the hint that I wasn\u2019t like other boys my age. They would wear superhero stuff and I would wear clothes that were more feminine. I even wore Little Mermaid pajamas on pajama day and a Monster High costume on Halloween. At that time I don\u2019t think I really cared what other kids thought about me. When you\u2019re in preschool and kindergarten and you\u2019re different, the other kids don\u2019t really care as much. My mom says I used to ask every morning if I was going to get bullied at school, but I don\u2019t remember that. My mom says it\u2019s good to forget stuff sometimes. Back when I was four and five years old, I used to tell my parents that I wanted to be a girl. I never said I was a girl. I just said I wanted to be a girl. Because then I could like all of the stuff and hobbies and clothes that I liked and nobody would care or give me a hard time about it. I used to draw myself as a girl. This summer, I went through my drawings from kindergarten and in all of them I had long ponytails and dresses on. It surprised me when I saw that. When I saw those drawings, it made me realize how fast people can forget things they did. I\u2019m going into fifth grade now and that was just back in kindergarten. I guess I do remember wanting to be a girl if I think about it really hard, but I don\u2019t want to be a girl anymore. I want to be me. Just me. I\u2019m a gender creative boy. I\u2019m a boy who likes girl stuff. I don\u2019t even like calling it girl stuff and boy stuff. There shouldn\u2019t be girl stuff and boy stuff; it\u2019s all just stuff. Sometimes I don\u2019t feel safe at school and other times I do feel safe. I don\u2019t feel safe at school when I\u2019m in the bathroom or when the fire alarms go off. I also don\u2019t like being alone. I don\u2019t feel safe in the bathroom because the boys just pee everywhere and they aren\u2019t as neat and tidy as the girls. I\u2019m more neat and tidy like the girls. I always go in the stalls, even if I\u2019m going pee. That makes me feel more secure. I feel like I\u2019m a different type of boy. But I\u2019m a boy for sure. I like both male and female pronouns. I don\u2019t really care which ones people use when they talk about me. I feel like pronouns are no big deal. Pronouns are not important to me, rainbows are important to me. My mom says different things are important to different people. People who are LGBTQ are important. That\u2019s a fact. People who are different are very important because they are people, but not everybody sees them that way. My mom and dad used to sometimes think I was transgender \u2013 a girl born in a boy\u2019s body. They even thought about letting me transition to being a girl when I was littler. That doesn\u2019t bother me because I know I\u2019d be a boy now. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible that I\u2019m transgender because I really like how I am. I\u2019m happy with myself. My mom and dad tell me that some parents with kids who are four and five years old are really stressed out because they have gender creative kids and they don\u2019t know what to do. I would tell those parents to just relax and let your kid be who they are. And, let them know that you love them no matter what. That\u2019s what my parents tell me. If I could talk to myself when I was four years old, I would tell myself \u201cdon\u2019t transition, because you are going to like who you are when you\u2019re older. You can like girl stuff without being a girl. You can just be you.\u201d But if a kid is transgender, their parents need to let their kid decide who they are and follow their kid\u2019s lead. If your kid is transgender, let them transition. Let them be who they are. Sometimes it\u2019s hard being a transgender kid or gender creative kid because you\u2019ve got to take a lot of time to figure things out. I think overall parents need to do a lot of relaxing.
