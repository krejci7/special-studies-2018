I got so many things for Christmas. And I love them all. But here are my favorites. LED Sneakers: They light up and you can change the colors. You can also make the lights flash or change colors on their own. The other day we went out shopping and four people stopped me to tell me they liked my shoes. Today we went to the library and two people told me they liked my shoes. That\u2019s six people.  Rainbow light: I turn it on at nighttime and use it as a nightlight. When I look at the rainbow when I\u2019m falling asleep I feel like a fabulous leprechaun. Origami: I\u2019m a master origami-er now. My mom bought me a beginner\u2019s origami book and I\u2019m almost done with it. My favorite thing to make is a swan. I didn\u2019t even ask for origami stuff but my mom knew I would like it. I had no idea I was so good at origami-ing.  Makeup: My Uncle Michael got me a for-real makeup case with makeup in it. He got me makeup brushes that feel so good on my face. I tickle myself with them. The makeup he got me is totally makeup for professionals. I\u2019m not a professional yet, but I will be soon. I even got pink eyelashes and mascara. My mom says she wants to borrow the lipstick and eye shadow he got me because it\u2019s from a brand called Urban Decay. Dress: My new drag dress is very colorful. It\u2019s short in the front and long in the back and glittery. When I put on the dress, I feel like I\u2019m a drag queen being a unicorn.  LEGO Friends Amusement Park: It came with a rollercoaster, a Ferris wheel and a spin-y thing. It had 1,124 pieces and I built the whole thing on Christmas Day all by myself. My mom says it was supposed to take me all of Christmas Break to build it and keep me busy. I was very proud of myself when I finished it. Flex Seal: I\u2019ve been wanting Flex Seal so bad so that I can make anything I want out of rubber. I\u2019m going to make a rubber cup and a rubber bowl.  Bath Stuff: I love to take baths. I got soap in the shape of little roses. And bath bombs. And bath confetti. When I take a bath I read People magazine and let the conditioner sit in my hair for a little while so that I don\u2019t have tons of knots.
