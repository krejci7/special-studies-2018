It\u2019s been six years since I launched this blog. My gender nonconforming son was three at the time. He was newly potty trained, loved the Disney Princesses and had a limited vocabulary. Now, he\u2019s a nine-year-old fourth grader who loves drag queens, Andy Warhol and who talks nonstop. If I listed all of the lessons I\u2019ve learned during the last six years, it might take me another six years. The biggest lesson I\u2019ve learned? To stop worrying. I used to worry so much. As much as you all read my worry, you\u2019ll never know how much worry truly engulfed my heart and mind. I worried about what other people would think about C.J.\u2019s gender expression and identity. I worried about what they would say to and about him. How they would react to him. How he would be treated at school. What his future would look like. What we would do if he identified as trans. What we would do if he came out as gay. I worried about my obsessive worrying. Sometimes I\u2019d catch myself not worrying and then start worrying about what I was forgetting to worry about. Then, our gender therapist helped me manage the worry. Whenever I shared a worry with her, she would say \u201cAnd then what would happen?\u201d My answer was always \u201cWe\u2019d deal with it.\u201d For example\u2026. Me: I\u2019m worried the kids at school will make fun of C.J. for wearing girl clothes. Therapist: And, then what would happen? Me: We\u2019d deal with it. More often than not it took many more \u201cAnd, then what would happens\u201d for me to get to the \u201cWe\u2019d deal with it.\u201d But, I always got there. Always. (If your answer isn\u2019t \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d If your answer has something to do with being embarrassed by your child, loving them less, resenting them or wanting them to change, you need help. I don\u2019t say it in a dismissive way. I say it earnestly. Please, seek help. From a supportive friend, a therapist, PFLAG, an online community, books, blogs, anywhere safe and trusted.) So, if I\u2019d always deal with a worry when/if it became a reality, then why was I wasting my time and stressing myself out worrying about it prematurely? Worry doesn\u2019t prevent things from happening; it just prevents you from enjoying the good things that are actually happening. When I stopped worrying, I started enjoying the colorfulness of my unique son. That\u2019s when life got happy. The beginning of this parenting journey and this blog was fueled by worry, wine and chocolate. My busiest blogging hours were in the dark of night \u2013 with the kids in bed, Matt at work and worry as my bedfellow. That\u2019s not my life anymore. Thank God. I don\u2019t spend my days defensively traveling ahead of C.J. making sure the path is clear, safe and prepared for his rainbow arrival. I\u2019m done with that exhausting rigamaro. I no longer live life ahead of my son; I live life with my son. I\u2019m no longer hyper vigilant. I\u2019m informative and matter-of-fact. I\u2019m not angry about the way things are, I\u2019m eager to change them for the better. I\u2019m sure of the things I need to know and do to address the challenges that come our way because of C.J. I\u2019m sure of the resources available to us and how to learn what I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure of my son, myself and \u2013 most importantly \u2014 my parenting. Surety erases worry. Confidence is calming. My son feels my surety and it\u2019s good for him. In turn, it\u2019s given him confidence and calm. He\u2019s sure of who he is, his style, the village he belongs to and the family that has his back no matter what. He knows that the answer to \u201cwhat happens if\u2026.\u201d is always \u201cwe\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d While I try to live in a place that is worry-free, it\u2019s a place that\u2019s certainly worry-adjacent. I can cross the city line to worry-ville in no time. I just try not to unless it\u2019s truly justified. I don\u2019t worry. I work. So that when something happens and I have to react, I\u2019m prepared.\u00a0I want to be prepared, not paralyzed with worry and fear. Now, I make the worry propel me into action. I\u2019m worried about 2017. I\u2019m worried about our future under the reign of the president-elect. But, I\u2019m focused on spending more time acting and less time worrying. Action is productive, worrying is not. The more I let go of worry, the harder it got to write. I don\u2019t see blog posts as we live our lives, like I did six years ago. I don\u2019t see his gender creativity as much. I don\u2019t see his purse entering the room first. I don\u2019t see his runway walk being practiced down the grocery store aisles. I don\u2019t see his French braid and lip-gloss when I drop him off at school. I don\u2019t see those things, I just see him.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
