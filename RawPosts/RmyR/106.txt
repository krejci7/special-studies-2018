This was all my friend Marie\u2019s doing.\u00a0She knows that C.J. often has mixed feelings about his underwear. He no longer wants to wear girls\u2019 underwear, but also finds boys\u2019 underwear to be very\u00a0boring.\u00a0So, Marie bought a package of white Hanes boys\u2019 brief and let C.J. tie-dye them. They are now his favorite. Marie is my favorite.  \u00a0 These Shoes:\u00a0He can\u2019t get enough of these shoes.\u00a0I\u2019ve told him he can\u2019t wear them to school when it starts.\u00a0He didn\u2019t like me saying that.\u00a0 The end.  \u00a0 Dreamcatchers:\u00a0C.J. has always been my good sleeper. When we brought him home from the hospital, he consistently slept five consecutive\u00a0hours at night. His doctor wanted me to wake him after four hours to feed him so he wouldn\u2019t starve to death. I didn\u2019t and he\u2019s still alive.\u00a0He\u2019s never been one to have bad dreams. On the contrary, he reports that his dreams have been known to feature cotton candy, cats and Kesha.\u00a0One night we were watching the\u00a0Twilight\u00a0movie\u00a0New Moon\u00a0in which\u00a0Jacob gives Bella a dreamcatcher and explains what it does.\u00a0C.J. was hooked. He bought himself a pink dream catcher and put it on his headboard. He\u2019s just like Bella Swan.\u00a0On vacation this summer, among his souvenirs were a dreamcatcher bracelet and another (much, much larger) dreamcatcher for his bed. When asked if the dreamcatchers keep his bad dreams away he said, \u201cYeah, I think so.\u00a0But I don\u2019t know why they are called night-mirrors, my dreams never have mirrors in them.\u201d  \u00a0 Wigs:\u00a0Read my last blog post to see just how in to wigs C.J. is. Plus, over the summer, a drag queen\u00a0taught C.J. how to put\u00a0a wig on\u00a0\u201cthe right way.\u201d He puts his thumbs up, rests the base of his thumbs against his forehead, when I put the wig up to his forehead, he hooks it with his thumbs and keeps them there as I pull the wig down in the back. Then, and only then, does he release his thumbs. He\u2019s perfected this technique and looks forward to using it for many years to come.  \u00a0 Puppets:\u00a0At present moment, C.J. wants to be a puppeteer when he grows up. He got his favorite puppet as another vacation souvenir and rarely goes anyplace without her.\u00a0 Her name has been Lucy, then Bucket, then Harry, then Lucy, then Caroline.\u00a0 She is currently nameless.\u00a0 She is a cheerleader, which makes C.J. kind of want to be a cheerleader, but he wants to be a puppeteer more.  \u00a0 SO SO\u00a0Happy Back-To-School Backpack:\u00a0C.J. loves everything that the SO SO Happy brand has to offer. (I mean, I do too, they make cool stuff, embrace individuality, build self-confidence, inspire positivity and acceptance among all beings).\u00a0He can\u2019t wait to rock this backpack on the first day of school.\u00a0 He\u2019d like you to know that \u201cyou can also wear it as a \u2018frontpack\u2019 to look like you are carrying the happy monster like a baby and that always makes people smile.
