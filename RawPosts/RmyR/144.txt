He stopped wanting makeup and then nail polish. \u00a0Then he would ask for a blue balloon instead of a pink or purple. \u00a0 I asked him what his favorite color was and he\u2019d say \u201cPink, but I want a blue balloon.\u201d \u00a0Now, a year later, he told me his favorite color isn\u2019t pink any more. \u00a0\u201cWhat is it now?\u201d I asked. \u00a0\u201cAqua.\u201d He also wanted a Band-Aid recently for a hangnail he had. \u00a0In the Band-Aid drawer I found mostly princess Band-Aids and he said he didn\u2019t want one of those. \u00a0I found a cheap plain hospital Band-Aid and he put it on. \u00a010 minutes later, he was back, because the cheap plastic Band-Aid was already falling off. \u00a0I said, all I have is the princess ones. \u00a0He said ok and put one on with no problem. \u00a0Everyone I know with other boys (including myself with two older boys) says that their son (and my older two) would rather BLEED OUT AND DIE at age 10 than wear a princess Band-Aid, and in this case, there was no blood, just an annoying hangnail. \u00a0This makes me believe that he hasn\u2019t changed; he\u2019s trying to conform. Since your CJ is first experiencing the pressure of society, this problem that I have now may soon be yours, so I really want your help and support. \u00a0What to do? \u00a0On the one hand, there is always a chance that with the advent of testosterone, which does start entering the picture years before puberty, maybe things are evening out and preferences are subtly changing. \u00a0Could be. \u00a0We are new at this; we do all know that some princess boys become straight men who might love opera or acting or just a fluid, free creative life. \u00a0So we just let our sons BE, as we always have. On the other hand, these changes are also coming at a time where peer acceptance becomes paramount (even as we olders and wisers know it shouldn\u2019t, every kid has to go through it). \u00a0Which makes me question how in like a month my son went from preferring girl style toys and wearing manicures daily to \u2026 Well, not. \u00a0Right after he admitted he\u2019d been teased. \u00a0And yes, he\u2019d heard all the stuff your CJ is hearing now: \u201care you a girl or a boy,\u201d \u201cyou can\u2019t have that because it\u2019s for girls,\u201d and all the other BS. \u00a0And back then, he would just say \u201cbecause I want to.\u201d But maybe at 9 it\u2019s harder to resist or put up with than at 6, where there is still a magical sheen over the world. \u00a0With all our acceptance, MAYBE THEY ARE STILL CRAWLING INTO THAT OLD CLOSET. If there is any way to get the question out into the public, especially to adult gay men (my son definitely is not transgender according to the psychological questionnaire; he ID\u2019s male), maybe you can do this. \u00a0You can use anything I\u2019ve written if it helps you. \u00a0I\u2019d love a blog post where you query the world, what can parents do when at some point there are signs the boy is entering a self imposed closet, even in 2013? \u00a0What would have helped you, the adult gay male? \u00a0How can they be themselves, even at this age? At four and six and eight, having parents and family who accept you is enough. \u00a0What if it isn\u2019t enough, at 9 or 10 or 11? \u00a0Your son is already \u201ccloseted\u201d with his lunch. \u00a0Just one year ago, my son was wearing a Gymboree girl\u2019s cardigan because it had cupcakes on it. \u00a0Now he\u2019s in a navy hoodie. \u00a0I don\u2019t care what he wears; I only care that he is happy within his skin. I just wish that being himself were enough to make my son happy. Thanks so much for reading, A fan from California\u201d   ", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
