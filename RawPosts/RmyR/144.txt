 I’m pinching myself.  Again. Publishers Weekly has named Raising My Rainbow one of their Best Books of 2013 in the lifestyle category! Chosen from the nearly 9,000 reviews, PW’s 101 Best Books of 2013 span all the adult genres — nonfiction; fiction; poetry; religion; mysteries and thrillers; cookbooks and lifestyle; health; parenting; crafts and hobbies; comics and graphic novels; science fiction, fantasy and horror; and romance and erotica. See the full list here. This year’s selection “rewards the famous as well as the undiscovered,” according to PW v-p and reviews editor Louisa Ermelino. She added that PW “avoids popularity contests, aiming instead for a wide-reaching spectrum of books.” Thank you, thank you, thank you to all of you who have purchased my book and shared it with others.  I’m humbled, honored and, frankly, a little giddy. * * * This weekend I was at Palm Springs Pride meeting readers, signing books, giving hugs, taking photos and sweating because I decided to wear jeans in the desert.  It was so nice meeting all of you who stopped by the Author’s Village. This month, I’ll be out and about.  I want to meet you! November 13:  PFLAG Long Beach November 20: PFLAG Los Angeles
