Six months prior, C.J. decided that he wanted to have his birthday at a wig store. I thought for sure he\u2019d change his mind, because he does that a lot. But, he repeatedly mentioned it and by November, I knew that I had to try to make it happen. So, I enlisted the help of my brother, Michael, who lives in West Hollywood, and gave him a list of things that C.J. wanted to do in celebration of his eighth birthday.  Go shopping for toys Go to lunch Try on wigs See the rainbow sidewalks (which I told him existed in West Hollywood) Eat pink cupcakes  On the morning of C.J.\u2019s birthday party day, we woke up and drove 30 minutes to my best friend Marie\u2019s house to pick up her and her two daughters (the dads stayed home to work). Her daughter Grace is four weeks older than C.J. and they are besties through and through. If you need proof, you can read their matching shirts that say \u201cI heart my bestie.\u201d Marie\u2019s daughter Kate is one of Chase\u2019s best friends despite her being three years older than he is. They share a love of bacon, Modern Family and making each other laugh. We took the kids to the Toys R Us near Marie\u2019s house to check \u201cgo shopping for toys\u201d off of C.J.\u2019s birthday party to-do list. C.J. selected some Shopkins, a Monster High pen and a Ballerina marionette.  An hour later, we were in West Hollywood greeting Uncle Michael and six of his closest friends at The Abbey \u2013 which has twice been voted the best gay bar in the world and was Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s favorite pub. Rest assured that at noon on a Saturday, the crowd was tame and family friendly. We were escorted to a secluded table on the patio and C.J. promptly handed out pink mardi gras beads to his guests (no flashing required). Because they were sitting across from me and next to each other, Uncle Michael helped C.J. decide what to eat. Imagine my surprise when C.J. ordered Nutella crepes for lunch. After lunch, the 13 of us (three straight females, six gay men and four children \u2013 for the sake of setting the scene) walked in parade fashion up Santa Monica Blvd. to the crosswalks painted rainbow. We crossed the street taking pictures all the way. Then, we turned around and crossed again. Then again. Then again. People took pictures of us taking pictures of ourselves.   We paraded back to our car and drove to the wig store of Uncle Michael\u2019s choosing. Though they didn\u2019t seem excited to see us rush into their store initially, the staff of three joined our party when they realized that we were celebrating a unique boy who likes wigs and falls more than just about anything else. Every member of the group chose one wig to try on. When C.J. fell in love with a fall that matched his one-of-a-kind hair color perfectly, I bought it for him and he wore it out of the store and the rest of the day.     At a neighboring toy and costume store, C.J. carefully deliberated which souvenir Oscar to award himself. Eventually, he bypassed the awards for \u201cBest Diva\u201d and \u201cDrama Queen\u201d for a win in the \u201cBest Son\u201d category. \u201cBecause don\u2019t you think I\u2019m a better son than diva and drama queen?\u201d he asked me looking for reassurance. I agreed. Back at Uncle Michael\u2019s place, we ate pink cupcakes, opened presents and sang along to popular Disney tunes that were blasting. C.J. fell asleep on the way home \u2014 as he always does after a long, fun day in West Hollywood. \u201cThat was the best birthday party! I\u2019m going to tell everybody at school that they should have their birthday parties at West Hollywood,\u201d C.J. said next day. West Hollywood, if you see an influx of children\u2019s birthday parties in the coming months and years, remember who started the trend.   * * * A huge, heartfelt thank you to everyone who attended the West Hollywood Wig Out Birthday Spectacular and made the day beyond special for C.J. Your acceptance and love for our family is profound and it\u2019s quietly letting our kids and their friends know that it\u2019s okay to unabashedly be themselves.
