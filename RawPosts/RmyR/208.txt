On his way upstairs to pack for his trip to see his new cousin.  Crap.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t have to turn around to know what he was pointing at.\u00a0 He had seen the shopping bags I had stashed in the back of the car and covered with a beach towel. You see, we have welcomed a new member into our extended family.\u00a0 C.J.\u2019s Dad\u2019s brother and his wife had their second child and it is a girl.\u00a0 They waited to learn the sex of the baby until the birth.\u00a0 A few days after they called to say that a baby girl had been born, I dropped C.J. off at school and spent two hours shopping for my new niece. I\u2019m the last person who should be enforcing traditional gender norms.\u00a0 I\u2019m the last person who should be buying $100 worth of pink clothes, blankets and burp clothes.\u00a0 I should know better than to buy a teething ring that looks like a giant engagement ring and rattle that looks like a luxury handbag.\u00a0 But, I did it. \u00a0I did it all and I\u2019m not taking it back. She\u2019s the first girl in the family, there are no \u201cgirl\u201d hand-me-downs for her, she needs clothes and when she\u2019s a toddler I will buy her tools, the best router table when she\u2019s older and cars and dinosaurs and encourage her to excel in math and science. \u00a0I will be her auntie who will tell her that she can be anything that she wants to be: president, astronaut, athlete, firefighter. But, for now, she can\u2019t hold her head up, sleep through the night or see more than a few feet from her face and I want to see her in pink with ridiculously sized flowers and bows in her hair.\u00a0 I would paint her nails if I could.\u00a0 Where you might have previously thought me to be a model citizen in the land of gender nonconformity, I had a niece and briefly became the queen of enforcing gender norms.\u00a0 You are more than welcome to leave an admonishing comment below.\u00a0 I was bad.\u00a0 Real bad. But, I knew that I couldn\u2019t be that person in front of my children.\u00a0 So I went shopping in secret, in private, while C.J. was at school and then hid the evidence to pack and ship later on the sly. \u201cWhat is all that pink stuff?\u00a0 Is it for me?!\u201d C.J. asked again. \u201cIt\u2019s presents for Baby Sarah,\u201d I said, knowing that it wasn\u2019t going to be a short conversation. Playing with Grandma Colorado\u2019s dogs at his cousins\u2019 house. We had told him about the arrival of Baby Sarah the night before at bedtime.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t exactly eager to tell him that there was a full-fledged girl in the family, but I had to after being reprimanded by Grandma Colorado for not spreading the good news. How would my gender nonconforming son react upon learning that the role of \u201cmost feminine child/grandchild in the family\u201d that he had been occupying for nearly four years had been snatched from him by a baby? \u201cHow come she isn\u2019t just getting hand me downs?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause she is a girl and our family doesn\u2019t have any baby girl hand me downs.\u201d \u201cShe can have my baby girl clothes hand me downs?\u201d he offered. \u201cBaby, you only wore baby boy clothes.\u201d I realized that my son probably can\u2019t remember a time in his life when he wore exclusively boy clothes. \u201cHow come you made me wear only boy clothes?\u201d he asked slightly disgusted. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t know that you liked girl stuff,\u201d I answered honestly. \u201cHow come you didn\u2019t know that?\u201d \u201cBecause you weren\u2019t old enough to tell me or show me.\u201d His sad face crushed me.\u00a0 He was wondering why I didn\u2019t know my own child, my baby. \u00a0How could I have been so wrong about my child?\u00a0 Because I was full of assumptions and expectations \u2014 none of which included my son being anything other than heteronormative. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby,\u201d I said to C.J.\u00a0 A blanket statement to cover so much. When was the last time you awoke to a fairy scaling the fireplace in your bedroom? We saw Baby Sarah a few weeks later and I worried how C.J. would feel about the newest member of our family who is everything he wants to be.\u00a0 I secretly prayed that Grandma and Grandpa Colorado wouldn\u2019t go on and on about finally having a girl in the family after generations of only boys.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know how that would make C.J. feel. Thankfully they didn\u2019t say anything to the effect. And, when C.J. got a chance to hold Baby Sarah he looked up at me and smiled that award-worthy smile of his.\u00a0 He gently adjusted her pink hat and kissed her cheek.\u00a0 I hope that the two of them become great friends\u2026in pink or blue or whatever hue.
