I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting to feel so much love.\u00a0 Sure I felt some hate, but I\u2019ve gotten really good at ignoring it.\u00a0 I also heard from the people who continue to believe that my blog and family are a work of fiction.\u00a0 That, to me, is laughable.\u00a0 I wish I had time to dream up fiction!\u00a0 I could do that instead of making three square-ish meals a day, doing laundry, working full-time or shuttling kids to-and-fro and back again.\u00a0 Fiction must be fun!\u00a0 If this were all a game, it would be a very tedious one to play \u2013 and I don\u2019t have time for games other than Candyland, Sight Word Bingo and \u201cMom, can you find my sock/shoe/homework/iPad/manners\u201d.\u00a0 Wish I did; but I don\u2019t. So, thanks to all of you who wrote to me and to those of you who found a way on your own to pre-order my book.\u00a0 I want you, my readers, to be the first to know about two other important supporters of mine, because you are in very cool company. I have received support from David Burtka and Neil Patrick Harris \u2013 who have done me the enormous honor of writing the foreword for my book.\u00a0 I still can\u2019t believe it\u2019s true. I think that David and Neil, as parents and members of the LGBTQ community, are the perfect people to introduce my book and our family to readers and the world.\u00a0 When you read their foreword, you\u2019ll get a sense of them as the awesome parents I\u2019ve seen them to be and you\u2019ll learn a thing or two about the always captivating Harper and Gideon.\u00a0 It\u2019s a rare opportunity for readers to get a glimpse into the lives of this new nuclear family. I\u2019m beyond honored that David and Neil see the importance of this book for kids, parents, educators and the LGBTQ community. C.J. doesn\u2019t know David and Neil as celebrities; he knows them only as Harper and Gideon\u2019s dads \u2014 the ones who don\u2019t care how gender creative he chooses to be in their presence.\u00a0 He sees the four of them and sees a family; a fun, normal family that has two dads who cook their own pizzas and sometimes randomly break out in song and dance. \u00a0He can be perfectly pink in their rainbow presence.\u00a0 That\u2019s all that matters to him. I see David and Neil as a gracious couple that I will forever be indebted to.\u00a0 When two guys have everything how do you thank them for doing a favor as massive as introducing you and your book to the world?\u00a0 If you have any ideas, let me know. * * * Although my book\u2019s pre-order pages are not totally complete aesthetically, they work functionally and you can now pre-order Raising My Rainbow: Adventures in Raising A Fabulous, Gender Creative Son (Foreword by Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka).\u00a0 How do you prefer it?
