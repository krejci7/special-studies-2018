Months ago we had a family date night.\u00a0 The four of us went out for Chinese food and, then, I needed to walk next door to the grocery store to buy toilet paper. \u00a0Fun date night, right? I wasn\u2019t familiar with that particular store and I couldn\u2019t find the toilet paper.\u00a0 I was walking around looking for a needle in the haystack with C.J.\u2019s Brother\u2019s help while C.J. and his Dad were whispering and conspiring about convincing me to buy something great for dessert while we were there.\u00a0 C.J. wanted cupcakes.\u00a0 C.J. always wants cupcakes.\u00a0 My argument that a fortune cookie is dessert wasn\u2019t going to hold up, I could tell. \u201cMom, why don\u2019t you just buy these lady toilet papers and let\u2019s go,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Brother yelled at me.\u00a0 He was standing next to an enormous display of on-sale tampons.\u00a0 He was holding a mega box with a tampon for every flow over his head; like a champion racecar driver holding up a gold cup. \u201cNo, baby, I need to find the toilet paper,\u201d I said, trying to ignore the scene. \u201cMooooooommmmmmm, just buy this lady toilet paper.\u00a0 We want to go,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Brother said louder, with a hint of nagging.\u00a0 Tampons still hoisted high. A woman nearby was stifling laughter.\u00a0 By this time, C.J.\u2019s Dad saw what was happening.\u00a0 He quickly went over to C.J.\u2019s Brother, took the box of tampons out of his hands, sat it back on the display, smiled at the lady witness, put his arm around our oldest son and distracted him.\u00a0 I found the toilet paper. \u201cI don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t just buy that lady toilet paper that I found for you,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Brother said.\u00a0 His feelings were a little hurt. \u201cBecause, baby, that isn\u2019t exactly lady toilet paper and, besides, we all need toilet paper,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, then what are those things anyway?\u00a0 I see them in your bathroom.\u201d I looked at my husband and he looked it me.\u00a0 I explained what tampons are and what they are for as we paid for our toilet paper and cupcakes and walked back to the car. C.J.\u2019s Brother cried all the way home.\u00a0 He cried for all the ladies who have ever had their period and for all of the girls he knows who will get their period one day.\u00a0 He ran down the list. \u201cDo you get a period?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cDid Nana?\u201d \u201cYeah, when she was younger.\u201d \u201cWhat about Saige?\u201d \u201cNot yet, but one day she will.\u201d \u201cThis is just so horrible.\u00a0 I feel so sad for all of you girls,\u201d he said through his tears. He slept on the news and woke up with more questions.\u00a0 Kids at school had been talking and he had had some puberty and sex-type questions in the past. \u00a0We had the big, super-detailed sex talk with him. As we ended our discussion he looked at his dad and me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll ever look at you two the same again.\u201d\u00a0 With that, he walked out of our room and I went to Game Stop to buy him the video game he had been coveting.\u00a0 I felt like he deserved a gift for having his world rocked.\u00a0 And, I wanted him to have something to get his mind off of his dad and me having sex. A few days later C.J.\u2019s Brother was in my bedroom talking to me as I got ready for the day when he mentioned that one of his buddies and a girl from their class were dating.\u00a0 I asked if he was attracted to anyone at school.\u00a0 When I talk to my kids about their current or future attractions, I never assume that they are gay or straight. \u201cMom, I\u2019m straight.\u00a0 It\u2019s time you faced the facts,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat?\u201d I was shocked by his directness. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 You always leave it open, like I could be gay.\u00a0 But, I\u2019m not,\u201d he said. I walked over to the bed where he was. \u201cOkay, but you know that if you were gay or are gay that is totally cool, too, right?\u201d I said. \u201cYes, of course, but I\u2019m not.\u201d \u201cOkay, but if your feelings change\u2026.\u201d \u201cMOM!\u00a0 I\u2019m straight!\u201d he said with firmness, a smile and a shake of his head. I called my brother. \u201cC.J.\u2019s Brother came out.\u00a0 He says he\u2019s straight,\u201d I told Uncle Uncle. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018he says he\u2019s straight\u2019?\u201d Uncle Uncle said. \u201cWell, things could change\u2026.\u201d I said. \u201cBabe, he just came out to you.\u00a0 He told you that he is straight.\u00a0 You have to listen to him and work from that for now and acknowledge it and believe it.\u00a0 That\u2019s it.\u00a0 He\u2019s straight.\u00a0 You have to honor that \u2013 just like you would if C.J. told you that he was gay. \u00a0Both of your kids know that you love them and support them and accept them whether they are gay or straight.\u00a0 But, when they tell you like that you have to believe them.\u201d My brother was right.\u00a0 I want my kids to know that their sexuality would never change the way I feel about them.\u00a0 They can be anywhere on the spectrum of sexuality and still have my unconditional love, acceptance and support.\u00a0 But, when they stake a claim on the spectrum like C.J.\u2019s Brother did, they have to know that I hear them and believe them. So, my oldest son is going into the fifth grade at the school for gifted students.\u00a0 He has his sights set on becoming a doctor (although, probably not a gynecologist, given how menstruation brings him to tears).\u00a0 He starts a new season of flag football next month.\u00a0 And, he is straight.\u00a0 I am the proud mother of a straight son.
