I needed\u00a0 to take a moment to gather myself.\u00a0 I\u2019ve admired her for more than a decade. I remember being on bedrest during my first pregnancy and watching Oprah interview Boylan as her book She\u2019s Not There was being released.\u00a0 I rushed to get the book and read it in a matter of days.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always preferred non-fiction to fiction and her story was one that I hadn\u2019t read before. What strikes me now, is that, even as I read it with a child growing in my belly, I didn\u2019t consider the possibility that my child(ren) could be transgender.\u00a0 When my second son, C.J., started playing with girl things and wearing girl clothes I thought about Boylan and I found that old copy of She\u2019s Not There on my bookshelf.\u00a0 I remembered how, long before C.J. came along, she taught me lessons on the fluidity and flexibility of gender and how sometimes a person\u2019s sex and gender don\u2019t align. A few months ago I devoured her latest book, Stuck in the Middle With You.\u00a0 Boylan \u2014 \u00a0like all people who approach life with an open heart and open mind \u2014 makes me feel safe because I know that she would appreciate and protect my son and my family.\u00a0 Those kinds of people aren\u2019t always easy to find.\u00a0 Boylan and her family understand the complexities of gender and that is comforting to me, it makes me not feel so alone and also gives me hope. In Stuck in the Middle With You, Boylan writes that as a man gender was something that she fought against.\u00a0 I see that in my son, too. \u00a0Boylan\u2019s open approach to gender and her bravery in educating readers makes the world a safer, more understanding world for people like my son. There\u2019s this quote that I love:\u00a0 \u201cYou have to go the way your blood beats. If you don\u2019t live the only life you have, you won\u2019t live some other life, you won\u2019t live any life at all.\u201d\u00a0 I hope that stories like ours and Boylan\u2019s help people to understand that and believe it. Thank you, Jenny.
