Recently, I\u2019ve noticed something else that these families have in common: the gender nonconforming child is adopted.\u00a0 Six out of the last eight families to have a parent contact me are raising a gender nonconforming child that is not biologically theirs. As I think back, before I started noticing the trend and keeping track, I can remember several other families who contacted me and who \u2014 while sharing with me a little about their gender nonconforming child \u2014 mentioned that s/he was adopted. Do adoptive parents need more help as they raise a gender nonconforming child?\u00a0 Or, are they just more likely to seek out help?\u00a0 Am I not hearing from biological parents raising their gender nonconforming child because they have it totally handled and don\u2019t need a thing? I hadn\u2019t mentioned this trend to anyone until I brought it up to a new mom friend of mine who I met through the blog and who is raising an adopted gender nonconforming boy. She thought about it for a while and then gave the most beautiful possible explanation. She believes that the universe places adopted families together.\u00a0 Maybe the universe or some higher power knew that she would be a great mom for a gender nonconforming son and so it gave her one. I nodded my head in agreement.\u00a0 I knew what she meant.\u00a0 I feel like the universe gave me C.J. on purpose.\u00a0 I\u2019m the best mother for him; I can feel it in my heart.\u00a0 I was meant to be C.J.\u2019s mother. We talked about it.\u00a0 And, she pointed out that most adoptive parents have to go through quite a lot to have a child; in most cases it\u2019s more of a process than biological parents have to go through.\u00a0 Maybe the intense longing to have a child, the legal process and the challenges that can go along with the adoption process readies a parent to be more accepting of absolutely whatever comes their way.\u00a0 Are adoptive parents more accustomed to seeking out help and resources? Because the child is not biologically theirs, can they better separate themselves from the child and the traditional expectations that go along with parenting a child that is half theirs and half their partner\u2019s?\u00a0 If so, does that better prepare them to avoid a mourning a process, see a challenge and address it?\u00a0 Adoptive parents have no idea what they are going to get. They start with no expectations because they don\u2019t know what to expect. They know that the child isn\u2019t going to be a mini-me, so are they more willing to let the child be who they were created to be \u2013 knowing that they signed up to deal with whatever they were given? Then, I noticed another trend.\u00a0 More than half of the families who have contacted me have mentioned that their gender nonconforming child is also a little behind in school, is at risk for repeating a grade level or has already repeated a school year. It feels like yet another special need families like ours must deal with.\u00a0 For C.J. for example, I feel like his slow academic progression can in part be attributed to his being focused on gender differences and worrying about whether kids will notice his different gender presentation.\u00a0 When you are worried if other kids will notice and tease you about liking girl stuff, learning addition and subtraction isn\u2019t going to seem important.\u00a0 Learning uppercase and lowercase letters doesn\u2019t feel like a survival skill.\u00a0 Blending in when needed and honoring your true self when safe to do so, do feel like survival skills.\u00a0 I can understand that. Also, if you\u2019re a boy who likes cradling a doll in the kitchen during free time in the classroom you seem a little younger and immature.\u00a0 Five- and six-year-old gender conforming boys have matured and moved past that.\u00a0 They have moved on to throwing sand at each other on the playground and tackling each other during games of full-contact tag. For parents who are living with all of these things \u2014 raising a child who is gender nonconforming, adopted and sixth months to two years academically behind their same-age peers \u2014 the challenges just seem to keep compounding.\u00a0 I have to believe it\u2019s because the universe knew what it was doing.\u00a0 It gave the unique challenges to parents who are strong, smart and loving enough to handle them and never accept defeat.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a scientific explanation, but it\u2019s the one that makes the most sense to me. * * * Raising My Rainbow has been selected as a finalist in the 2013 Parents Blog Awards in the category of \u201cMost Likely to Inspire You to Change the World.\u201d Voting is super simple.\u00a0\u00a0Just click here\u00a0and select my blog under the\u00a0\u201cMost Likely to Inspire You to Change the World\u201d category. \u00a0You can vote once a day until Feb. 24.
