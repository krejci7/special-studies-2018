Well, C.J.\u2019s Dad is right here, right beside me.\u00a0 And, he\u2019s wherever C.J. needs him to be \u2013 whether it\u2019s behind him, beside him, ahead of him or carrying him.\u00a0 He\u2019s never been anywhere but where our family has needed him to be.\u00a0 Every wife and child should be so lucky. I love you, baby.\u00a0 Happy Birthday! * * * C.J.\u2019s hair is practically a trending topic.\u00a0 So, here\u2019s the story on C.J.\u2019s hair for all of those who are interested.\u00a0 It\u2019s cut short in what the majority of society would consider to be a \u201cboy\u2019s haircut.\u201d\u00a0 Why do I have it cut that way?\u00a0 Because that\u2019s how C.J. wants it. This time last year he wanted to grow it out \u201clike a girl.\u201d\u00a0 So we did.\u00a0 A week before kindergarten started in September he asked to \u201ccut it short like a boy.\u201d\u00a0 So we did.\u00a0 This week he asked to \u201cgrow it out like a girl.\u201d\u00a0 So we are.\u00a0 As always, we are just along for the ride.\u00a0 Stay tuned and send some detangler! * * * Happy Valentine\u2019s Day from C.J. and his family.\u00a0 He went with Monster High Valentines again this year. \u00a0Be yourself, be unique, be a monster, be my Valentine. * * * Raising My Rainbow has been selected as a finalist in the 2013 Parents Blog Awards in the category of \u201cMost Likely to Inspire You to Change the World.\u201d Voting is super simple.\u00a0\u00a0Just click here\u00a0and select my blog under the\u00a0\u201cMost Likely to Inspire You to Change the World\u201d category. \u00a0You can vote once a day until Feb. 24. I would love to win this honor because\u00a0Parents Magazine\u00a0is one of the leading (if not the leading) parenting magazine in the U.S. and exposure to my blog would no doubt help some of their millions of readers better understand gender; consider their expectations for their child when it comes to gender, sex and sexuality; and hopefully encourage them to educate cisgender children to be more empathetic and kind towards LGBTQ children. A special thanks to the person or people who nominated me!\u00a0 I\u2019m flattered and grateful.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
