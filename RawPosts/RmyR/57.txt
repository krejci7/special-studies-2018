On Giuliana Rancic: I\u2019d wear that to a fancy Easter dinner. On Mindy Kaling: It looks like she was a blueberry and then she got run over right up her middle and the blueberries squeezed out her armpits. On Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes: Are they married? They should be. On Alicia Vikander: Hello lemons! Now THAT looks like the Oscars! On Sofia Vergara: It looks like a curtain that a grandma would have and a little too much of her boobs are out. But I love her earrings. On Priyanka Chopra: That is way too much see through. Her belt looks like a lock for a diary. Olivia Wilde (Photo cred: VALERIE MACON/AFP/Getty Images) On Olivia Wilde: She\u2019s not a dog so she doesn\u2019t need a collar. And she\u2019s not Miley Cyrus so she doesn\u2019t need that top. The bottom looks like a cupcake wrapper. On Saoirse Ronan: I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it, except the earrings. On Naomi Watts: That\u2019s my favorite so far! She looks like a mermaid. Favorite. On Olivia Munn: I like it. It looks like she is wearing a side cape. Are Forevermark diamonds from Forever 21? On Jennifer Jason Lee: It looks like an old timey hat. Is she drunk or something? On Rooney Mara: Too much lace. She has lots of hair; she should have a big bun, not a tiny bun. Brie Larson (Photo cred: Getty/Jeff Kravitz) On Brie Larson: I LOVE IT! I don\u2019t even have any words! I LOVE IT! On Heidi Klum: She can do better than that. It\u2019s like Cinderella got in a fight with her stepsisters and they ripped off her sleeve and her boob line. On Bryan Cranston: Snooze. On Chrissy Teigen: Too bad someone squirted hot sauce all over her. On Ashley Graham: She did her boobs all wrong. She needs to fix it a lot. She did it all wrong. All wrong. On Cate Blanchett: That looks nice with her skin color. How does she get her skin to look like that? On Jared Leto: He\u2019s the funnest boy! Jared Leto (Photo cred: E!)
