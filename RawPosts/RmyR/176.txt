My son is not blue he is pink. He twirls. He sparkles. He captivates. \u00a0 My son is not blue he is pink. He skips in his dress. Wears his nightgown to bed. Paints his nails with a steady hand. \u00a0 My son is not blue he is pink. He dreams of being a grown up. The girl on top of the wedding cake and a daddy who is more like a mommy. \u00a0 I grew up with a boy who was not blue but was pink. Who loved Wonder Woman. Who turned into a rainbow. Who watches his nephew and smiles. \u00a0 A pink mom married to blue dad raising two boys \u2014 one blue and one pink. Boys who can be any color of their choice. Love the person of their choice. Live the life of their choice. \u00a0 Because when you are a family with a boy who is not blue \u2014 but is pink, you learn to not care what other people think. \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
