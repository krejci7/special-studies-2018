 Stop everything you’re doing and set your DVR to record The Hub’s new series titled SheZow!.  It premieres tomorrow, June 1, at 12:30 p.m. EDT/9:30 a.m. PDT. Learn more about the series here.  “Twelve-year-old Guy is an extreme dude who inherits the power ring of his deceased aunt – the amazing superhero SheZow! The ring gives him villain-battling super powers, but was meant to be worn by a girl and the result is absolutely she-larious! A lovable yet mischievous tween who hates responsibility, Guy Hamdon is suddenly forced to save the world as the legendary female superhero SheZow. Trapped inside a crazy female superhero costume with big hair, high heeled go-go boots and she-mazing superpowers like mega strength and she-riffic speed, Guy “plays” the part of heroine on his way to becoming a super man. Once Guy Hamdon utters the magic words, ‘You go girl!’ he becomes SheZow…and it’s ‘No more Mister Nice Girl!’” * * * After you’ve set your DVR to record SheZow!, stop everything  you’re doing and check out the new photography project by one of my readers, Parisa Taghizadeh. View the amazing photos here.  “BOY is a series of portraits of my son who enjoys “dress-up.” Although the project seems to be about a boy’s love for princesses and fairies, it’s more an inquiry into what little boys are allowed to be before the world changes them and molds them into some notion of what it means to be a man in our society.” Seriously people, the photos moved me.  I could see C.J. in them.  They are beautiful and captivating, but more than that they show the perfect innocence that boys like C.J. sparkle because of.  I can’t stop looking at the photos. * * * After you’ve checked out Parisa’s photos, stop everything you’re doing and go straight to Facebook and “Like” Millions of Moms for Love. “We will not stand silently while groups like One Million Moms or the American Family Foundation spread their anti-gay message. We believe every human being has the right to love who he or she was born to love and not suffer discrimination because of it!” This group and its founder reinforce that you should never underestimate the power of a mother.  Learn more in this article about Millions Moms for Love by GLAAD. * * * Other things that have interested me this week: A recent USA Today story about a family raising a gender variant child: http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/28/gender-boy-girl-school/2366811/ A recent CNN post about sex/gender stereotyping kids: http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/28/opinion/perry-gender-children
