Some of my readers aren\u2019t on Instagram and have asked me to share posts here as well. So, following are highlights from March. Click here to view every post. If you\u2019re on Instagram, follow me. If you already follow me, ignore this post. Or not. It\u2019s up to you.  \u201cTo be gender nonconforming is to risk being killed, but on a daily basis it more likely means being harassed, confused and misunderstood in the community or maltreated by mental health professionals. . . . There is no doubt that these children are among the ranks of minority individuals in our society who must anticipate bigotry and antipathy from those who either do not understand, are ill-informed, govern their thinking with myth rather than reality or . . . project hatred onto those who are different from themselves. At the same time, gender creative children diverge from almost all other minority children in that they have an additional mark against them: they may face aspersion from their very own family, loved ones who are supposed to be their protectors.\u201d Diane Ehrensaft in her book Gender Born, Gender Made. The statistics for kids like CJ are scary. Compared to his straight cisgender peers, he is prone to the highest rates of depression, addiction, unsafe sexual behaviors and suicide rates. The most important thing families can do to improve those statistics is simple. Love and support the child no matter what. \u201cI love you no matter what.\u201d Matt and I say it to both of our boys. Our love for them isn\u2019t conditional. No matter who they are, who they love and what other people say, we love them no matter what. \u201cWe studied Mary Cassatt at school today and did art like she did. My art teacher said we could make a boy hat or girl hat for our person. I rolled my eyes at her on the inside because she is an artist and she should know that there is no such thing as boys\u2019 hats and girls\u2019 hats. This is me. I\u2019m in a shirt and bow tie because people always dressed fancy in those days. And I gave myself a hat that the art teacher said was a girls\u2019 hat. When she said that I rolled my eyes at her again on the inside.\u201d \u2014 CJ, age 10. Three cheers for loving and supportive grandparents who know that one of their grandsons will want a pink chocolate bunny, instead of a blue one. CJ: Mom! Look! Doesn\u2019t my eye makeup look so much better than yours?! \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude0a Me: Yes! Part of parenting is wanting better for your children, but I\u2019d like my makeup to look that good too. \u201cIt takes a village to healthily launch a gender nonconforming child into adulthood. But that\u2019s not always how the siblings want to spend their time.\u201d \u2014 Diane Ehrensaft, PhD. There are some struggles and challenges that come with being the sibling of an LGBTQ person. Chase and I have that in common. At nearly 14 years old, Chase is source of constant wonder to me. He loves video games, he taught himself to play the guitar, he listens to classic rock, his hobby is photography and he has mad skills in the kitchen. While CJ reminds me of my brother, Chase is like no one I\u2019ve ever met. I\u2019ve never witnessed a cisgender straight boy become a man. Chase is the very best brother that CJ could have. He is kind, loving, supportive and protective. He also calls CJ out on his shit, doesn\u2019t treat him special and holds him accountable. Sometimes that\u2019s exactly what CJ needs. Serving Florida retiree goes to lunch with her gurls, eats Cobb salad and is home by 2 pm realness. \u201cLook, Mom! I made gender nonconforming cups. The boy cup is wearing a dress and the girl cup is wearing a jersey.\u201d \u2014 CJ, age 10 Kids (all people, actually) look for themselves in other people and things. CJ notices anything that is a fellow redhead \u2014 from Ariel to orangutans. He also notices anything that is gender nonconforming. And, if given the chance, he\u2019ll make things gender nonconforming. \u00a0 Much to CJ\u2019s displeasure, I\u2019ve been monopolizing the sewing machine lately. He\u2019s kept himself busy making food out of felt, which he can sew by hand. \u201cShould I use a whip stitch or a back stitch?\u201d he asks me. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d I ask. (Clockwise from top: doughnut, pop tarts, carrot, egg, toast) \u201cWhat should I do now?\u201d He asks. He knows better than to say \u201cI\u2019m bored,\u201d he knows I\u2019ll say \u201cOnly boring people can be bored.\u201d He doesn\u2019t much like electronics or technology. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just play on the iPad and chill for a minute. Nope. He always wants to be creating and crafting. Today he is making felt finger puppets. Most 10-year-old boys read and follow Lego instructions, my boy reads and follows sewing patterns. Oh, and he\u2019s pissed that this pattern says to make pants for a boy puppet and a skirt for girl puppets. \u201cBoys can wear skirts and girls can wear pants!\u201d he declared. \u201cI\u2019m going to put my boy in a skirt!\u201d Take that pattern maker! When your son\u2019s messy bun is better than yours and you want to hate him for it but you love him too damn much. Like most gender nonconforming boys, CJ\u2019s closest friends have always been girls. His girl friends are funny, smart, colorful, loyal, kind, accepting, supportive and fiercely protective. And, they write him notes like this: You are the peanut to my butter. Twinkle in my eye. Shake to my bake. Blue to my sky. Sprinkles to my sundae. Flip to my flop. Jewel on my crown. Milk to my shake. Beat of my heart. But, most of all, MY BEST FRIEND. I\u2019d walk through a fire for you! Well, not fire because it\u2019s dangerous\u2026but a super humid room. But not too humid, because my hair\u2026. \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
