Minus the dress. \u201cYou look like one of those Mormon Duggars,\u201d Uncle Uncle said to me as we lunched recently and I contemplated cutting my overgrown hair. \u201cThey\u2019re not Mormon,\u201d I replied, taking a bite of chips and guac. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d he said.\u00a0 (Oh no he didn\u2019t!) \u201cHow come Kim Kardashian and Angelina Jolie can have long hair, but I can\u2019t?\u201d I asked defensively, thinking that my argument was solid. \u201cShack up with Brad Pitt and we\u2019ll talk,\u201d Uncle Uncle said to me, his favorite sister, with a smile. A couple months\u00a0later Uncle Uncle\u00a0came for a visit and we were watching C.J. play with his Strawberry Shortcake dolls.\u00a0 I could tell that Uncle Uncle was deep in thought.\u00a0 I waited for it.\u00a0 I knew some incredible insight was coming. Picture this hairstyle, with red hair, on a four-year-old effeminate boy. That's C.J.! \u201cC.J. has the same haircut as Liza Minnelli,\u201d he said thoughtfully.\u00a0 \u201cYou know that old lady short do.\u201d He was right and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Haircuts are a tricky thing for C.J.\u00a0 He usually wants his hair long like Rapunzel.\u00a0 Which is just fine, except that the minute his bangs are long enough to get in his eyes he gets annoyed and goes crazy, often times wagging full-on war, swatting them out of the way and, then, crumbling to the ground in defeat.\u00a0 He decided that he wants shorter bangs and longer hair on the sides and the back.\u00a0 I have a hard time being okay with that because he would look too much like the mascot for Dutch Boy Paint.\u00a0 C.J. often describes this haircut when asked how he wants his hair. It\u2019s an age-old problem; wanting beautiful long locks but not being patient enough for the growing out and styling process. Whoopsie! C.J.'s Mom cuts bangs like this. A few days ago, I decided to cut C.J.\u2019s bangs myself because they were falling in his eyes and ruining his life.\u00a0 The good news?\u00a0 He no longer looked like Liza Minnelli.\u00a0 The bad news?\u00a0 He looked more like Jim Carrey\u2019s character from Dumb and Dumber.\u00a0 Just when I thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse, it did.\u00a0 I was over the long waits and service at our usual Cool Cuts 4 Kids, so I decided to take C.J. and pop into Hair Masters, which is right next to our grocery store. We walked in.\u00a0 C.J. was wearing a green hoodie, jeans and white sneakers.\u00a0 He was carrying a plush Rapunzel doll, but otherwise looked all boy.\u00a0 The stylist took us to her station.\u00a0 \u201cWhat kind of cut does the pretty girl want,\u201d she asked, running her long acrylics through C.J.\u2019s super-thick red hair.\u00a0 I ignored her because I simply thought that she misspoke.\u00a0 She referred to C.J. as a girl again and I corrected her.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s a boy,\u201d I said with a look and tone that questioned her intelligence. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I saw the doll and\u2026.,\u201d she trailed off.\u00a0 Sadly enough, I\u2019m getting used to people apologizing and trailing off. C.J.'s favorite part of getting is hair cut? The styling cape. Duh. Two more times she referred to my son as a girl.\u00a0 Was she crazy?\u00a0 Did she just not care?\u00a0 Was I overreacting?\u00a0 I corrected her each time she made the mistake. She proceeded to give him the worst haircut of his life.\u00a0 She sprayed water in his face, scared him with the blow dryer and told him that he needed to concentrate on what he was doing.\u00a0 Now, last time you got a haircut, did you have to concentrate on what you were doing?\u00a0 I sure didn\u2019t. \u201cIf you tell HIM what you are going to do before you do it, this might go a little smoother,\u201d I said to her as she trimmed his bangs and dropped hair directly into his open eye. This lady was clueless and I was near tears or verbal assault. Finally, the great hair massacre of 2011 was over.\u00a0 \u201cWhat flavor lollipop does she want?\u201d she asked.\u00a0 C.J. looked at me.\u00a0 Apparently we were both fighting back tears. He choose grape and we left. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that lady wasn\u2019t very nice,\u201d I said to C.J. \u201cYeah, she was so in-propriate,\u201d he said as he enjoyed his candy and skipped along. There are no words.... The next day I called to complain to the manager, who really couldn\u2019t be bothered with the details of a customer\u2019s bad experience.\u00a0 She offered to fix the botched job.\u00a0 We went back to the salon, but I\u2019m not sure it was worth it.\u00a0 Apparently they are not, as their name would indicate, masters of hair. If you\u2019ve been following our adventures, you know how important hair is to C.J.\u00a0 Right now, the poor little guy doesn\u2019t like what he sees in the mirror.\u00a0 That makes me sad, because I always want my boys to like what they see in the mirror.\u00a0 I\u2019m trying to help him by getting creative with the styling of his hair.\u00a0 We do the old Justin Beiber\u00a0swoosh to one side and the Robert Pattinson\u00a0bed-head disheveled look.\u00a0 We\u2019ve even, at the suggestion and direction of C.J.\u2019s Brother, tried the Nate Berkus.\u00a0 Those make him feel better.\u00a0 We\u2019ll ride out this phase together until he once again likes what he sees in the mirror\u2026 and, in the meantime, we\u2019ll look for a new stylist.
