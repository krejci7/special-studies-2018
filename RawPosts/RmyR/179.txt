As a child, I remember playing with her rainbow-colored, plastic-headed pins and produce-inspired pincushion.\u00a0 I\u2019d imagine that they were tiny gum balls clinging to a giant red tomato with a strawberry repelling down the side to safety. My grandmother would have let me help with the actual sewing, but it just wasn\u2019t my thing.\u00a0 Her talents, creativity and never-ending patience were lost on me; but C.J. would have loved her. My mother, Nana Grab Bags, loves to sew and her and C.J. have been spending a lot of time in her sewing room lately.\u00a0 They started out using fabric glue and Stitch Witchery on their creations.\u00a0 Now, they have moved on to C.J. draping fabric on himself and Nana Grab Bags pinning it.\u00a0 Then, she carefully removes it and sews it just the way it had been pinned.\u00a0 My son cries as if he\u2019s been assaulted when he gets a small splinter or scrapes his knee playing outside, but if he gets poked or scratched by pins while draping and sewing he doesn\u2019t bat an eye.\u00a0 Instead, he tells me that it\u2019s okay. My mother offers her style suggestions and they discuss design.\u00a0 But, ultimately, it\u2019s C.J. decision and Nana Grab Bags gladly obliges. C.J. recently designed his own dress.\u00a0 Brace yourself, because it\u2019s a lot to take in.\u00a0 All fabric, accouterments and placement were C.J.\u2019s decision. Some of the fabric C.J. selected because \u201cit\u2019s shiny and sassy and drapey.\u201d Clearly. This ribbon reminded C.J. of fairies and fairy tales and Barbie. These fabric rosettes are super sassy fancy flowers according to C.J. He picked this iron-on patch because it reminded him of Monster High. C.J. and Nana started with Mock Smock fabric that comes smocked at the top and pre-finished at the top and bottom. C.J. paired it with pink glitter spandex leggings. Draping the fabric and pinning the flower and fringe. Nana pinning the back per his instructions. Making decisions. Nana tied the back so that it would be no-sew. Teamwork. Strike a pose. Vogue. All smiles.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
