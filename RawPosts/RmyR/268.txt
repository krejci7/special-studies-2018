Of course the driver of the car would come out and catch us touching and photographing his vehicle. “Oh, um, hi,” I said with my sweetest smile. “I’m sorry, but my son loves your car.” “No problem. Do you all want some t-shirts?,” he asked. “YES!,” screamed C.J. The nice man from Lipstick Bail Bonds gave us stickers, air freshners and tank tops.
