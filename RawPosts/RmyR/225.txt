It happened to me last week and my heart is still all warm inside. Popsicle Princesses My son was up in a tree house with a new friend he had met just hours before.\u00a0 C.J. was wearing a dress that had a big, full lilac skirt and a bodice made of black velvet with delicate purple and pink flowers embroidered on it.\u00a0 His new friend, C.K., was wearing the most amazing Cinderella knock-off I have ever seen, complete with gathered tiers and a sweetheart neckline. They were both barefoot with faces stained from their homemade berry popsicles.\u00a0 They sat with their backs to us two moms.\u00a0 They whispered to each other and giggled often.\u00a0 I could have died of happiness at the sight. C.J. and C.K. both have older brothers, who were approaching the base of the tree house.\u00a0 C.J. hopped up, threw open the white shutters and yelled \u201cHey!\u00a0 You boys!\u00a0 Stay out of our garden!\u201d \u201cYeah, stay out of our garden!\u201d C.K. yelled from behind C.J.\u00a0 The white shutters slammed shut and uncontrollable giggles wafted over to the deck where I was sitting. The older brothers looked at us moms and we just shrugged.\u00a0 Yes, I thought, stay out of their garden, stay out of their way, they are having the best day ever. A few weeks earlier, C.K.\u2019s Mom had been looking for play groups in Orange County for gender nonconforming kids (there aren\u2019t any) when she found my blog.\u00a0 What are the chances that we live just seven miles apart? We talked via phone, email, text and scheduled a play date.\u00a0 I told C.J.\u2018s Dad that we were off to play with a boy who likes to play with girl stuff, left the address of our destination and set out with managed expectations.\u00a0 Before I knew it, the front door opened and we walked into a house that is home to no girl, two boys, lots of pink, an enviable dress-up collection and a four-foot-high, multi-floor, all-pink castle.\u00a0 A pink princess tent takes up most of the family room. Monster High Manicures C.K. flitted down the stairs in a pink terrycloth sundress.\u00a0 C.J. looked at me.\u00a0 I knew what he was thinking and I nodded and smiled at him, silently acknowledging that, yes, he owns the same exact dress in turquoise. C.K. is petite, with olive skin, dark hair buzzed for the hot days of summer and the sweetest way about him.\u00a0 There\u2019s an innocence about him that you want to protect and keep intact.\u00a0 Something about him asks politely to be treated delicately; and when you\u2019re with him, you can\u2019t imagine treating him any other way. The four brothers started playing immediately.\u00a0 C.K. had requested via text \u2014 because that\u2019s how kids do it these days \u2014 that C.J. bring some \u201cgirl stuff\u201d to play with.\u00a0 C.J. brought his life-size plush ballerina doll (which was $14.99 at Ralph\u2019s in December and is quite a nappy embarrassment at this point), a Sleeping Beauty Barbie (who also looks like she\u2019s been through the ringer) and Ghoulia Yelps from Monster High (who lost her top sometime ago and usually has her red bowling shorts around her knees, but don\u2019t you know her wedge sneakers are always perfectly in place!).\u00a0 The two boys discussed in great detail My Little Pony, Care Bears and Strawberry Shortcake as the older brothers sprayed each other in the face with the garden hose and chased each other with plastic snakes. C.K.\u2019s Mom and I compared our lives.\u00a0 When did C.K. start liking \u201cgirl stuff?\u201d\u00a0 Age two and a half or three.\u00a0 Same with C.J.\u00a0 Does C.J. like to dance?\u00a0 Oh, yes.\u00a0 C.J. wears a tutu to dance class?!\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Can\u2019t C.K.?\u00a0 No.\u00a0 How sad!\u00a0 We worry about the older brothers.\u00a0 We worry about bullies and we worry about school.\u00a0 Is it jarring now for you to see him in boys clothes?\u00a0 Yes!\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t it feel so much more natural to see them in feminine attire or doing some thing feminine?\u00a0 Yes!\u00a0 We worry about who and when to tell that our son is gender nonconforming.\u00a0 Do you like the term gender nonconforming?\u00a0 How about gender creative?\u00a0 How about gender fluid?\u00a0 How about gender independent?\u00a0 How about gender identity disorder?\u00a0 No! Spending time with this family felt natural and easy.\u00a0 Over the course of our marathon, three-hour playdate (which I assumed would more closely resemble a 5K), C.K. changed once every hour.\u00a0 From pink terrycloth sundress to black leotard with tutu to full-on Cinderella ball gown to close the show.\u00a0 C.J. wanted in on the action; he wanted to slip out of his tie-dyed rainbow shirt and into that lilac and velvet number he spied on C.K.\u2019s miniature garment rack. Ever the gracious host, C.K. showed C.J. to a room where he could change in privacy.\u00a0 When C.J. emerged, all dolled up and glowing, C.K. gasped out loud. \u201cC.J., you look beautiful!\u201d he said in sincere amazement. \u201cThank you,\u201d C.J. said.\u00a0 He was trying to be modest, but he was feeling it, he felt beautiful. Shoe Sharing Sillies C.K. offered C.J. some of his jewels.\u00a0 C.J. slid a heart-shaped, pink-stoned ring onto his finger.\u00a0 C.K. clipped on chandelier earrings and applied some Clinique lipstick.\u00a0 C.J. had serious 99 Cent Store earring envy. \u201cMan, I just can\u2019t stop thinking about those earrings,\u201d C.J. said later, on the way home.\u00a0 He was in the back seat with his legs crossed, right over left, like my mother always told me a lady should sit. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard not to think about something,\u201d I said, as I pictured the two small boys making their way up to that tree house, with that garden that those pesky older brothers wouldn\u2019t stay out of.\u00a0 They were way up high, dressed to the nines and my heart melted for my son in the late afternoon sun. * * * Other things you should be reading this week: Pretty In Pink: An article by an amazing dad of a gender nonconforming son. \u00a0It begs the question I\u2019ve been asking a lot lately\u2026.Does standing up for human decency make a person an activist?
