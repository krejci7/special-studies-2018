 Halloween is a time when Matt and I are reminded of how much we’ve evolved as parents. From three-year-old C.J. wanting to be Snow White and us convincing him to be a skeleton to now – when I steam his dress and watch in awe as he applies makeup using skills he’s acquired watching countless tutorials on YouTube. Our boy is growing and maturing. The past few months he’s been drawn to mid-century design, vintage pinup fashion and 1950’s culture. So, when he saw a 1950’s car hop girl costume, his annual costume hunt quickly came to an end. Of course, because C.J. has to use his creativity and love for all things creepy and quirky whenever he can, his waitress has a backstory. She was murdered with a pair of pink fuzzy dice while delivering an order. Cue the excuse posthumous makeup. Today, Yahoo! Parenting is running a slideshow of C.J.’s Halloween costumes over the years with my commentary about our evolution as parents of a differently gendered child. Check it out!
