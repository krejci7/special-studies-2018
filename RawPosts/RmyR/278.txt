Grandma and Grandpa Colorado: What are you going to San Diego for? Me: Well, we are going to a conference for bloggers, because I started a blog about raising C.J. Them: What\u2019s a blog? Me: It\u2019s like a journal online that other people can read. Them: We\u2019re not on Facebook. Me: It\u2019s not Facebook.\u00a0 It\u2019s like a website where I can write whatever I want. Them:\u00a0On the interweb? Me: Yes, the internet. Them: Are we blocked from seeing it, like Facebook? Me: No it\u2019s not blocked, you can see it. Them: We don\u2019t really go on the internet and we definitely don\u2019t do Facebook. If this is wrong, I don't wanna be right. The subject changes seamlessly to talk of the weather, cinnamon bears being more aggressive than black bears and the neighbor up the street who loved his hunting dog more than his wife. Grandma Colorado: You know, our good friends told us that you were writing inappropriate articles about C.J. online.\u00a0 This must be what they were talking about. My heart sinks into my stomach, which drops to my knees, which start to shake.\u00a0 My face flushes as I feel anger and sadness. Everyday people disagree with my choice to chronicle my adventures in raising C.J. and my skin has grown thick.\u00a0 But, when the criticism comes from closer to home the pain is fresh. Me: Not everybody agrees with my decisions initially, but if they really take the time to read my writings, they usually change their mind.\u00a0 You know, I actually kind of have a lot of people reading my blog and I feel like I\u2019m doing something important. Grandma Colorado: Well, I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I don\u2019t go on Facebook.\u00a0 All I know is we\u2019re going to love C.J. no matter what. Me: Well, that\u2019s all that matters. Silent minutes absorb the evening. Grandma Colorado: I just can\u2019t believe that C.J.\u2019s Dad is so forgiving of C.J. Me: What do you mean? Grandma Colorado: I can\u2019t believe that C.J.\u2019s Dad is so forgiving of C.J\u2026 and you, I guess.\u00a0 Because your brother is gay and C.J. is the way he is. Me: Do you mean forgiving or accepting? Grandma Colorado: Accepting, I guess. I say nothing, because if I open my mouth I\u2019m not sure what will fly out.\u00a0 I\u2019m not, by nature, an insecure person.\u00a0 But, in that moment my mother-in-law, bless her speak-before-you-think heart, hit on one of my biggest insecurities: that C.J. being gender nonconforming, effeminate and possibly gay is my fault. That I should be thankful that my husband is a big enough man to not hold C.J.\u2019s gender creativeness and possible future sexual orientation against me. Me: Well, that just means that you did something right. Later, I talk to my mom about it on the phone. Nana Grab Bags:\u00a0Well, if someone has to be blamed then the blame goes on me because I had Uncle Uncle. She laughs and I try to, too.\u00a0 If fault has to be found, then we are your girls. Later, Grandpa Colorado sneaks up behind me while I\u2019m on his computer. Grandpa Colorado: Can you add your blog to my \u201cfavorites\u201d tab? Me: Sure Nothing more was said, or has been said.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 28 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
