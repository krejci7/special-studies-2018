When the Chick-Fil-A anti-gay controversy broke out during the summer, it was a no-brainer for C.J.\u2019s Dad and I to have a conversation with our sons about the company\u2019s beliefs and decide as a family that we weren\u2019t going to eat there anymore. Our little family took a big stand and let it be known.\u00a0 Most people assumed our anti-Chick-Fil-A stance was based on our love and support of my gay brother.\u00a0 It\u2019s a correct assumption, but a limited one.\u00a0 My husband, my sons and I decided to boycott Chick-Fil-A in love and support of the entire LGBTQ community and, more importantly, because in our house we believe that all people are created equal and deserve to be treated that way.\u00a0 To us, there is no excuse for hate and discrimination, not even the go-to \u201cthe bible told me so\u201d explanation.\u00a0 Call us crazy. We also wanted to use the situation to teach a life lesson: sometime you have to sacrifice in order to stand up for what you believe in.\u00a0 Chick-Fil-A has long been a favorite of C.J. and his Brother.\u00a0 They would miss the food for sure. Our kids agreed with our decision.\u00a0 Our nine-year-old son wrote a letter to Chick-Fil-A president Dan Cathy.\u00a0 Our five-year-old son (who is gender nonconforming) understands that Chick-Fil-A isn\u2019t nice to everybody, that they are mean to some people and that that is not okay. My husband and I made it quite clear to those close to us \u2014 especially those people who, on occasion, feed our kids when we are not around \u2014 that we would not be eating at Chick-Fil-A. That was our decision.\u00a0 If someone we knew didn\u2019t make the same decision, we were disappointed but we didn\u2019t unfriend them.\u00a0 We just asked them to get their fill of those homophobic nuggets, sandwiches and waffle fries when we weren\u2019t around. Sometimes you have to agree to disagree. We\u2019ve learned that sometimes that is easier said than done. Last week, a member of our family had a few moments alone with our oldest son and engaged C.J.\u2019s Brother in a conversation about Chick-Fil-A, which lead to the family member explaining the biblical definition of marriage and what the bible says about homosexuality to our nine-year-old. We.\u00a0 Were.\u00a0 Pissed. We felt like we had been purposefully betrayed and deceived.\u00a0 We felt like our son had been part of talk that was inappropriate because of our beliefs, his age, the topic and the family member\u2019s knowledge that we are LGBTQ allies through and through.\u00a0 And, none of that takes into account that our son\u2019s beloved uncle is gay and his brother has a very high likelihood of being gay or transgender. Once we took a few days and few steps back, we realized that we assume that people in our family\u2019s lives will behave as we expected them to. \u201cThe easiest way to get your expectations unmet is to fail to communicate those expectations to the person who is supposed to meet them,\u201d someone said to me recently. We had never clearly communicated how we expected the adults in our family\u2019s lives to conduct themselves around our children when it came to matters of religion and being LGBTQ. We sat down with the family member and, for the first time, said out-loud what we expect of them and others.\u00a0 Initially, it felt weird to do it.\u00a0 But after we did it, it felt weird that we hadn\u2019t done it earlier. We had never said out-loud to the people in our lives: 1. \u00a0Please do not talk about religion to our children. We believe that God is more about love, kindness and inclusiveness than he is about fear, hate and shame.\u00a0 We believe that he created each person perfectly and without flaw and that, more than anything, he wants each person to be treated that way.\u00a0 And, if judgment is necessary for entrance into heaven?\u00a0 It\u2019s God\u2019s to give, not ours. Whether you agree with our religious views or not, let\u2019s all play it safe and refrain from engaging children in conversations meant to sway them.\u00a0 If you feel like it\u2019s your calling to spread the word of your God or your religion, please don\u2019t spread it onto our children. 2. \u00a0If you have something unkind (at best) or hateful (at worst) to say about the LGBTQ community we have to insist that you do not say it around our children or us.\u00a0 We\u2019ve ended friendships for less and do realize that sometimes family ties are a little trickier to deal with. All that being said, anyone \u2013 family or not \u2013 who teaches our children that their uncle and other LGBTQ people aren\u2019t equal, are sinful and should be excluded from things like civil rights will be eliminated from our lives. 3. \u00a0Because our child is gender nonconforming and has been for more than half of his life, statistically speaking he has about a 75 percent chance of being a member of the LGBTQ community.\u00a0 When our family is around, please conduct yourself as if a member of the LGBTQ community is in your presence. 4. \u00a0Also, because of his gender nonconformity, compared to his peers he has a much higher likelihood of attempting suicide, experiencing major depression, abusing substances, developing addiction and practicing unsafe sex and behaviors. \u00a0We can lower the likelihood of all of those things being in his life if we protect him from bullies.\u00a0 Bullies aren\u2019t just at school; all too often they are in the home.\u00a0 Our home and family has to be a safe, loving and accepting place for him.\u00a0 Always.\u00a0 \u00a0If you can\u2019t help create that kind of environment then you are probably helping to destroy it \u2013 which means you shouldn\u2019t be a part of it at all. Thankfully, our family member listened to our expectations and agreed to meet them in the future. \u00a0We agreed to forgive and try to move forward.\u00a0 We also agreed that Chick-Fil-A wasn\u2019t what almost ruined our family \u2013 that family member\u2019s actions and our failure to communicate our expectations did. * * * Would you allow someone with different religious beliefs to talk to your children about their beliefs and religion without you around?
