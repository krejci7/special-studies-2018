Sons savoring the sunset. But, all of that was when my son was four-years-old and him realizing his sexuality seemed like a thing for the distant future.\u00a0 Then, Amelia (who writes for the Huffington Post\u2019s Gay Voices section and with whom I\u2019ve gotten to know via email) started writing about her son who is seven years old and openly identifies as gay.\u00a0 He came out when he was six.\u00a0 Then, an awesome mom who I met through my blog wrote last week about her son and how he recently declared that he is in love with another boy.\u00a0 He is six.\u00a0 He is in kindergarten.\u00a0 C.J. is almost six.\u00a0 C.J. is in kindergarten. I used to think that we had until middle school (plus or minus a year or two) to learn our son\u2019s sexuality.\u00a0 What if it happens in kindergarten?\u00a0 What if it happens tomorrow? There is a new hesitation in me.\u00a0 If he is LGBTQ, I wanted my son to be out of the closet \u2013 never in it \u2013 with us, his family.\u00a0 I hadn\u2019t factored in how he would handle it with the other seven billion people on earth\u2026at age 6, then 7, then 8, then\u2026.? If my son were to come out to us in the next five to ten years, what do I tell him about being open about his sexuality?\u00a0 That it\u2019s a private matter, which only his family needs to know about? What would I tell him if he were heterosexual?\u00a0 Would I parent him the same? If I encourage him to keep a part of himself a secret, am I pushing him into the closet? Do I explain to him the dangers of being out to certain types of people \u2013 his bullying schoolmates included?\u00a0 Is a child equiped to fully understand that? How do I teach my son that he\u2019s perfectly made, raise him with no shame, encourage him to be the most authentic version of himself\u2026and then tell him to keep quiet about it at school and on the playground? If C.J. is LGBTQ, I\u2019ve always wanted him to be out and free and proud.\u00a0 Knowing that that moment may be closer than we thought, what I really want is for my son to be safe.\u00a0 And, sometimes it feels like he can\u2019t be out and free and proud and safe all at the same time.
