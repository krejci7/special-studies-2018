He\u2019s been called \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s biggest, most famous troll on Twitter,\u201d and now, he\u2019s terrorizing the family of a gender nonconforming child. \u2014 HuffPost  That gender nonconforming child is our son. We are that family. Rather than retreating and/or ignoring the barrage of hate that followed Wood\u2019s tweet, Matt and I chose to speak to HuffPost about what we\u2019ve experienced over the past several days. Click here for the interview. If you choose not to click through or read the entire interview, at least read the following excerpt about the support we\u2019ve received \u2014 because it\u2019s been amazing. People Magazine also did a short interview, click here to read it.  What kind of support have you received? Matt:\u00a0We have received a lot of support from our friends and family. Anybody who knows us knows that we have an awesome support system. It goes to show that you don\u2019t cultivate relationships with quality people for the good times. You do it for the hard times. That\u2019s when true friends step up, support and encourage you. They remind you that you\u2019re doing the right things for your children. I expected my friends and family to be there for us, I wasn\u2019t expecting the outpouring of encouragement and love from the public and celebrities. Lori:\u00a0This incident has shown us that the village we are lucky enough to be a part of will assemble at a moment\u2019s notice to support and protect us. We\u2019ve had close friends and mere acquaintances reach out to us and defend us. They offered to help us in any way they can and have made good on their offers. The LGBTQ community was also swift to be by our side. We\u2019ve been in constant communication with the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) since the tweet. I\u2019ve seen firsthand how quickly and powerfully HRC can mobilize to provide support, a listening ear and sound advice. It\u2019s amazing. PFLAG has also been checking on us throughout the day and offering help. Members of the LGBTQ community who are strangers to us have offered support and encouragement.   And all of the people and organizations that have contacted us have always been \u2013 first and foremost \u2015 concerned for our safety and wellbeing. And, then, there are the celebrities who came to our defense.\u00a0When Neil Patrick Harris replied to Woods\u2019 tweet,\u00a0I was speechless. As a parent, when someone comes to your child\u2019s defense, the positive emotion is overwhelming. With Neil being who he is and having the audience he does, that positive emotion was multiplied. We are so thankful for his tweet and support. When other celebrities started retweeting Neil\u2019s tweet, it felt like this big, powerful, loving, supportive army had assembled in front of us and we could take a moment to catch our breath.
