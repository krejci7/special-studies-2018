Thank you to all of you readers out there who sent me links to news about the \u2013 by now \u2013 infamous J. Crew ads of a mother painting her son\u2019s toenails pink.\u00a0 I love to see images of and know that there are other mothers out there raising sons like mine.\u00a0 I love it.\u00a0 Others don\u2019t. My favorite article about the ad is found here on CafeMom.\u00a0 I\u2019m off to J. Crew to buy C.J. a little something for spring. Don\u2019t ever stop sending me things that you think I should see/read.\u00a0 It takes a village\u2026. P.S. If Beckett ever wants to playdate, C.J. is totally available.\u00a0 If he were to get a \u201cFriends and Family\u201d discount at J. Crew all the better.
