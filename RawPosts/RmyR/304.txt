 First and foremost….Thank you! Thank you to all of you readers out there who sent me links to news about the – by now – infamous J. Crew ads of a mother painting her son’s toenails pink.  I love to see images of and know that there are other mothers out there raising sons like mine.  I love it.  Others don’t. My favorite article about the ad is found here on CafeMom.  I’m off to J. Crew to buy C.J. a little something for spring. Don’t ever stop sending me things that you think I should see/read.  It takes a village…. P.S. If Beckett ever wants to playdate, C.J. is totally available.  If he were to get a “Friends and Family” discount at J. Crew all the better.
