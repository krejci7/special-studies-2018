Last Monday\u2019s post\u00a0summarizing the results of a survey that I conducted about raising homosexual and/or transgender children got people to think and question.\u00a0 A few of the results keep popping into my head.\u00a0 Seven percent of\u00a0people would rather their child be missing his/her left arm than love someone of the same sex.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 I keep thinking it, seven out of 100.\u00a0 Seven armless children. If people had to choose to raise a straight tomboy girl or straight effeminate boy, they chose to raise the girl.\u00a0 Not one person elected to raise a straight effeminate boy.\u00a0 I caught myself looking at C.J. several times this week and thinking, \u201cNobody would choose to raise you.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019d lift my chin up and think, \u201cWell I\u2019m honored and proud to raise you.\u00a0 I\u2019d choose you.\u201d\u00a0 I want to look into his four-year-old hazel eyes and make him understand that I would choose him, even if nobody else would.\u00a0 Now, Dr. Ablow didnt approve of Becketts pink toenails, but are C.J.s toe rings okay? Then, along came toemagadden; which, of course, all started when J. Crew ran an ad featuring its president and creative director Jenna Lyons and her five-year-old son Beckett.\u00a0 His neon pink toenails made a lot of people see red and made me feel blue. In his Fox News blog, self-proclaimed super-smarty-pants Dr. Keith Ablow made it clear that he doesn\u2019t approve of Ms. Lyons and all of us moms who are set on not changing our kids, but celebrating them, loving them and raising them to be exactly who they were created to be.\u00a0 When it comes to parenting, according to Dr. Smartypants, we\u2019re doing it all wrong.\u00a0 It\u2019s the gay men and transgendered (and even the lesbians, bless you girls!) who tell me that I\u2019m doing what they wish their parents would have done for them as children.\u00a0 It\u2019s all the people who grew up \u201cdifferent\u201d that tell me that raising my \u201cdifferent\u201d child the \u201csame\u201d as everybody else just isn\u2019t going to do.\u00a0 Shame on Dr. Smartypants for making a mother feel small for making her child feel big. Dr. Smartypants As \u201cAmerica\u2019s Psychiatrist\u201d he would serve a greater purpose by making an informed diagnosis and offering helpful treatment.\u00a0 The social commentary he offered in his Fox blog failed to do that.\u00a0 It was rude, judgmental and sarcastic; three things a psychiatrist has no business being while on the clock.\u00a0Be an ass in your free time, please. I found it interesting that, in his blog post, he writes negatively of Facebook.\u00a0 For shits\u00a0and giggles I looked him up on the F-B.\u00a0 The good doc has 3,127 friends!\u00a0 Goes show that my theory is right, never trust an adult with more than 500 Facebook friends; get a fan page. The final blow of the week?\u00a0 Queerty.com, the leading website for LGBT\u00a0news, ceased operating this week.\u00a0 Queerty.com and David Hauslib\u00a0have been so good to me and RaisingMyRainbow.com.\u00a0 They syndicated almost all of my posts, helped me find a larger audience and answered silly question after silly question when I was three mojitos deep at The Abby.\u00a0 Cheers to David and whatever fabulous adventure he conquers next.\u00a0 Cheers, Queerty. Thanks for everything. Who wants to syndicate my content now?   ", "feedtitle": "Page 31 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
