Get your best Texas twang ready, because here are his words exactly. \u201cDirect your son in an unconfusing way. Don\u2019t buy him Barbie dolls or girl\u2019s clothes. You don\u2019t want to do things that seem to support the confusion at this stage of the game. Take the girl things away, and buy him boy toys. Most importantly, support him in what he\u2019s doing, but not in the girl things.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Phil McGraw. \u00a0I want to scream and cry and become defensive and find comfort in chocolate.  \u00a0  You, C.J., need to stop playing with girl toys. 1.) \u201cDirect your son in an unconfusing way. \u00a0Don\u2019t buy him Barbie dolls or girl\u2019s clothes.\u201d  Um, hi, if I took away all of C.J.\u2019s girl toys he would be nothing but confused.\u00a0 There would be no \u201cunconfusing\u201d way to do it or to never buy him girl toys again.\u00a0 Children are not simpletons. C.J. would be confused as to why mommy and daddy won\u2019t let him play with the things that he loves to play with most.\u00a0 He would be confused as to why he can\u2019t play with girl toys, but girls can play with boy toys.\u00a0 He would be confused as to why his big brother gets to select his own toys, but he does not. To me it\u2019s like saying, what you like is not okay.\u00a0 And, that is not okay. C.J. would have every right to be confused.\u00a0 I imagine that it would be like telling me that I should and could only enjoy hobbies and things that I hate.\u00a0 I could go to the supercross, but not the spa.\u00a0 Go to the auto parts stores, but not the mall.\u00a0 Study martial arts, but not celebrity gossip.\u00a0 Drink beer, but not martinis. Furthermore, besides feelings of confusion, C.J. might experience feelings of rejection, abuse of power, extreme jealousy and inadequacy.\u00a0 I\u2019m not willing to subject my son, either one, ever, to those feelings.  \u00a0  According to Dr. Phil, C.J. can no longer play with these.  \u00a0  2.) \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do things that seem to support the confusion at this stage of the game. Take the girl things away, and buy him boy toys.\u201d Right.\u00a0 Take all of the girl toys away.\u00a0 I don\u2019t even want to imagine what that would do to my child.\u00a0 Really, Dr. Phil?\u00a0 Take away all of C.J.\u2019s girl toys?\u00a0 That would leave him with his brother\u2019s old Thomas the Tank Engine trains, a few crappy toys that accompanied Happy Meals, a Nerf gun, a plastic cowboy and Indian set that Pa and Nana Grab Bags brought back from a trip to Dallas and a few other odds and ends that he has no passion for.\u00a0 He plays with none of these toys, but I keep them in his room, mixed in with his girl toys in case the mood to play with boy toys ever strikes.\u00a0 It hasn\u2019t. And, does the Woody doll from Toy Story count?\u00a0 Because it is a boy, but it is also a doll.\u00a0 What about his set of pink Legos?\u00a0 Legos\u00a0are, for the most part, marketed to boys, but pink is a girl\u2019s color and it came with a girl mini-fig and a tiny hairbrush for her and her horse to share (gross).\u00a0 \u00a0What about his Scooby\u00a0Doo character set?\u00a0 Should I toss Daphne and Velma and leave Scooby, Shaggy and Fred? Dr. Phil really needs to be more specific. Also, I\u2019d like to know if he gives the same advice to parents with little girls who want to play with cars, baseballs and super hero action figures.\u00a0 Would he tell a tomboy\u2019s parents that their daughter might grow up to be too strong, too tough, too independent, too masculine, too\u2026.not normal, not okay? Imaginative play is encouraged in our house.\u00a0 No matter the character, no matter the gender.  \u00a0  According to Dr. Phil, C.J. is allowed to play with these. \u00a0   3.) \u201cMost importantly, support him in what he\u2019s doing, but not in the girl things.\u201d Nice.\u00a0 Only support half of your child; you can support all of them if they fall in the range of \u201cnormal.\u201d\u00a0 I should support C.J.\u2019s brother because he is into video games, baseball, skateboarding and fart jokes.\u00a0 But, I shouldn\u2019t support C.J. completely because he likes dolls, playing beauty parlor, doing girly sticker books and walking around in my high heels.\u00a0 Support him, but only half way.\u00a0 Let him know that only certain parts of him are okay.\u00a0 To me this is the worst suggestion of the bunch.\u00a0 We all deserve to be celebrated all the way. Dr. Phil goes on to say that \u201cthis is not a precursor to your son being gay, he\u2019ll know that in time\u2026this is not an indication of his sexual orientation.\u201d Another important Dr. Phil quote? \u201cHomosexuality is not a learned behavior. A sexual orientation is inherited; you are wired that way.\u201d So what does it matter if C.J. plays with girls toys now if his sexual orientation already lay dormant inside of him waiting to blossom in adolescence?\u00a0 What does it matter what a kid plays with?\u00a0 That\u2019s the answer I want.\u00a0 I want a reason.\u00a0 Dr. Phil doesn\u2019t want C.J. to play with girl toys, but why?\u00a0 Why not?\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t say \u2014 and that is dangerous.\u00a0 I\u2019m just supposed to take his word and follow his commandments because he said so?\u00a0 I\u2019m not that kind of girl. And, I don\u2019t understand why he tells guests \u201cJessica and Thomas\u201d about their cross-dressing toddler twins: \u201cGet over it! This isn\u2019t a sex role identification thing, a gender issue or a gay issue.\u201d How come toddlers can cross-dress and their parents need to get over it, but C.J. can\u2019t play with girl toys and I need to take them all away? Dr. Phil, in his latest large article on parenting, advises parents: \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Don\u2019t fight individuality \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do embrace a child\u2019s nuances\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Don\u2019t label the child \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Don\u2019t ignore an issue that matters to your child \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do empower \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Don\u2019t pick wrong battles \u2013\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do consider child\u2019s desires Thanks Dr. Phil, I\u2019m doing these things, but I guess it doesn\u2019t matter when your boy plays with dolls.
