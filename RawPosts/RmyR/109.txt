C.J. and Chase\u2019s last day of school is today, my day job is busier than usual and I\u2019ve been working on a side project that I can\u2019t wait to tell you about some day. Don\u2019t you hate it with people vaguely allude to exciting news and then reveal nothing? Here are some things I can reveal\u2026 Raising My Rainbow is being released today in ITALY!!!! I am not fluent in Italian, so I will not be able to read it. But, if you can, you should. Click here to order it. This weekend I\u2019ll be in Las Vegas for the American Library Association\u2019s Annual Conference, where I will be presented with the 2014 Stonewall Book Award-Israel Fishman Non-Fiction Award. I\u2019m seriously so excited! What should I do while in Vegas? Suggestions welcome! Last but not least, PFLAG national reblogged my Father\u2019s Day post to their A Note To My Kid website. A Note to My Kid is a project of PFLAG National that gives parents, families, friends and allies of the LGBTQ community the opportunity to share their unconditional love, via notes, photos and videos. It\u2019s such a touching project. Check it out and write a note to your kid. More soon, I promise. \u00a0Maybe a photo or two from Vegas?   ", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
