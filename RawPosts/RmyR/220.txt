In the mediums of crayon, colored pencil and marker, our son is a beautiful girl with long red hair, a big puffy ball gown the color of cotton candy and a tiara with a gigantic heart-shaped stone front and center.\u00a0 Sometimes he\u2019s a sassy girl in a jean skirt, black leather jacket and knee-high boots.\u00a0 Sometimes he\u2019s a girl going to school in a hot-pink t-shirt dress and purple high top sneakers with turquoise socks peaking out. It took his dad and me a while to get used to seeing our son\u2019s self-portraits.\u00a0 For a long time there was the urge to correct him, to remind him that he is a boy and his renderings weren\u2019t accurate.\u00a0 We fought that urge until it wasn\u2019t there anymore.\u00a0 Feelings of uneasiness popped up in us here and there when it was time for arts and crafts, especially when there were other people around.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had to remind myself that you never tell an artist that his or her art is bad or wrong \u2014 art can\u2019t be those two things (especially when you are five). Being acutely aware that children who continually, over an extended period of time draw themselves as the opposite sex are more likely to be transgender, we have always wondered if and when the day would come when our boy would draw himself as a boy looking like a boy.\u00a0 We imagined that if it ever happened we would feel a sense of relief and happiness.\u00a0 Then, it happened and we were nothing but sad. C.J. has just started kindergarten and at his school every kindergartner is matched up with a \u201cKinderbuddy,\u201d an older student at the school who will see C.J. on a regular basis throughout the year to read to him, play with him and mentor him.\u00a0 Hopefully they will have a mutually beneficial and special relationship. Because the school tries to match up Kinderbuddies based on sex/gender, C.J.\u2019s Kinderbuddy is a boy.\u00a0 Because C.J.\u2019s sex and gender aren\u2019t in total alignment, that process for matching up Kinderbuddies isn\u2019t exactly ideal. On their first day of meeting, the Kinderbuddies had to sit together and draw a picture of themselves together.\u00a0 That\u2019s when it happened; C.J. drew himself as a boy next to his boy Kinderbuddy. \u201cMommy, I got a Kinderbuddy today.\u00a0 And, he\u2019s so cool!\u00a0 He\u2019s a teenager!\u201d C.J. said after school.\u00a0 By \u201cteenager\u201d he meant \u201csixth grader.\u201d He showed us the picture that they had drawn together.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t recognize our son.\u00a0 We looked at each other in shock. \u201cHey, Buddy\u2026how come you drew yourself as a boy?\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad asked casually. \u201cOh, that\u2019s because I didn\u2019t want my Kinderbuddy to know that I like girl stuff,\u201d C.J. said matter-of-factly. Our hearts sank.\u00a0 We had always thought that things would feel more right, more normal, on the day that C.J. finally drew himself as a boy, but things didn\u2019t.\u00a0 Things felt sad because our son had to do it out of self-preservation.\u00a0 He did it to adapt and conform.\u00a0 He did it to hide his true self.\u00a0 It felt like he had lost some of his innocence. Diane Ehrensaft, an expert on raising gender nonconforming children, once wrote: \u201cGender creative children are blessed with the ability to hold on to the concept \u2014 that we all had one time in our lives \u2014 that we were free to be anything we wanted \u2013 boy, girl, maybe both.\u201d With that drawing, it felt like our son was losing his grip on the concept that he is free to be anything he wants to be.\u00a0 Was he losing his grip?\u00a0 Or, was he tightening his grip on the concept and exercising control over when it could be on display and when it couldn\u2019t? C.J. didn\u2019t want to hang his Kinderbuddy drawing on the fridge or his bedroom door for all to see like he usually wants to do with his art.\u00a0 He wanted to throw it away. \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cCause that\u2019s not really me,\u201d he said as he sat in the sun at our dining room table, drawing himself with a side ponytail, purple shirt with a pink heart on it and an orange skirt.
