Here it is with the lip gloss closed.  And, here it is with the caf\u00e9 mocha-flavored lip gloss exposed.  I pointed out to Nana Grab Bags that the lip gloss girl looks like she is taking a crap and my son rubs said crap on his face. This is what C.J. looks like with the lip gloss on.  C.J.\u2019s Dad came home from work and saw C.J. and followed me out of earshot into the kitchen.  \u201cHas C.J. been eating shit sandwiches?\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s his new lip gloss. It\u2019s caf\u00e9 mocha flavored. My mom bought it for him,\u201d I explained. He walked out of the room shaking his head and passed C.J. who flashed him his best brown smile. * * *  Have 13 minutes and 14 seconds to spare this weekend? Watch this video. The lives of little boys like C.J. depend on it.    ", "feedtitle": "Page 27 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
