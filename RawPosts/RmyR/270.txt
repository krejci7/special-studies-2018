All Posts Lip Gloss Nana Grab Bags 
 Nana Grab Bags bought C.J. a new lip gloss on a necklace; which is his fav-o-rite accessory this season. Here it is with the lip gloss closed.  And, here it is with the café mocha-flavored lip gloss exposed.  I pointed out to Nana Grab Bags that the lip gloss girl looks like she is taking a crap and my son rubs said crap on his face. This is what C.J. looks like with the lip gloss on.  C.J.’s Dad came home from work and saw C.J. and followed me out of earshot into the kitchen.  “Has C.J. been eating shit sandwiches?” “No, it’s his new lip gloss. It’s café mocha flavored. My mom bought it for him,” I explained. He walked out of the room shaking his head and passed C.J. who flashed him his best brown smile. * * *  Have 13 minutes and 14 seconds to spare this weekend? Watch this video. The lives of little boys like C.J. depend on it.
