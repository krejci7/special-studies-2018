The thought both excited and terrified me. I pushed it to the back of my mind as I graduated, landed a corporate job, got married, and got pregnant. My first son made me a mother ten years ago. My second son will make me an author on September 3, 2013. My professor had been right. I had a book in me; I just couldn\u2019t know what the topic would be until I started raising a boy who is a girl at heart. My six-year-old son C.J. is gender variant or gender nonconforming or gender creative or has gender identity disorder, whichever you prefer. As C.J. simply explains it, he is \u201ca boy who only likes girl stuff and wants to be treated like a girl.\u201d While my older son is a typical boy who has turned me into a Lego engineer, video gamer, and football mom, my youngest son is a unique boy who has turned me into a princess stalker, hairstyle guinea pig, and Rachel Zoe of the Barbie world. Two and a half years ago, I started an anonymous blog called Raising My Rainbow. The first blog to chronicle the adventures in raising a fabulous, gender creative son, I started it to sort through my emotions and to connect with other parents of gender creative kids and former gender creative kids themselves. I blogged twice a week, my work became syndicated by one of the leading LGBTQ news sites, readers in more than 170 countries tuned in, and gender studies students and faculty at more than fifty college and universities have asked for more. Now, in less than three months (one week as of today!), I\u2019ll be sharing our lives with a broader audience with the release of my blog-inspired book, Raising My Rainbow. I\u2019ll also come out of the blogging closet and identify myself. The book gives a glimpse into our lives to show people that we aren\u2019t weird\u2014we\u2019re just different. And different isn\u2019t bad. Different can and does happen to anybody. Your neighbor. Your coworker. Your friend. Your enemy. You. Raising My Rainbow is about expectations. You don\u2019t always get what you expect when you are expecting. You expect your child\u2019s sex and gender to align. Sometimes they don\u2019t. You expect your male child to like traditionally male things and be physically and emotionally attracted to a woman. Sometimes that doesn\u2019t happen. The book is also about empathy. It took a while to realize that what we want most from other people is empathy. We don\u2019t need people to fully understand gender, sex, and sexuality; we need them to have an open heart and an open mind. Finally, the book is about the evolution of a family. Though we didn\u2019t know it at first, when our son grabbed that first Barbie we set out on a journey of change. No one in our family is the same person he or she was four years ago. Now, I wouldn\u2019t change this experience for anything in the world. Shamefully, I couldn\u2019t always say that. I recently met with that favorite college professor of mine for a glass of wine and to catch up. I wanted to tell her that she had been right. I did have a book in me\u2014but I had to experience life and meet my Barbie-loving, dress-wearing son to know what the topic would be. All my best, always, Lori Duron Pre-order the Raising My Rainbow book! \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 16 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
