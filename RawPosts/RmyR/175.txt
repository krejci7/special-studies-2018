 In honor of LGBT Families Day (June 3, 2013), GLAAD contacted me and asked me to publish something on a topic related to LGBT families.  Instead of a blog post, I wrote the following poem. My son is not blue he is pink. He twirls. He sparkles. He captivates.   My son is not blue he is pink. He skips in his dress. Wears his nightgown to bed. Paints his nails with a steady hand.   My son is not blue he is pink. He dreams of being a grown up. The girl on top of the wedding cake and a daddy who is more like a mommy.   I grew up with a boy who was not blue but was pink. Who loved Wonder Woman. Who turned into a rainbow. Who watches his nephew and smiles.   A pink mom married to blue dad raising two boys — one blue and one pink. Boys who can be any color of their choice. Love the person of their choice. Live the life of their choice.   Because when you are a family with a boy who is not blue — but is pink, you learn to not care what other people think.
