I hear from a lot of you who say that when it comes to parenting I\u2019m doing it right.\u00a0 And, I never ever hesitate to let someone know if I think that they are doing it right. Well, read this for an example of a father who is doing it wrong \u2014 if you ask me.\u00a0 It starts with his son wanting a sketch pad and him calling it a \u201cgay ass notebook.\u201d\u00a0 It gets worse from there.\u00a0 Charming. * * * \u201cOver the past few decades, we\u2019ve made a lot of changes in the English language to make it more gender neutral. We say \u201cpolice officer\u201d instead of \u201cpoliceman\u201d and \u201cpeople\u201d instead of \u201cmankind\u201d\u2026But there\u2019s one thing we can\u2019t seem to get right: pronouns. We know that if you say, \u201cEvery child has his monkey,\u201d it excludes girls. So instead we might say, \u201cEvery child has their monkey,\u201d even though it\u2019s not grammatically correct. And \u201cEvery child has his or her monkey,\u201d is just clunky.\u201d When it comes to pronouns, C.J. prefers his masculine\u2026even though when it comes to clothes and playthings, C.J. prefers his feminine.

Washington gave his Atlanta address; the United States expanded the effects of the Monroe Doctrine in South America; and Oscar Wilde was tried and convicted for gross indecency under Britain\u2019s recently passed law that made sex between males a criminal offense. When news of Wilde\u2019s conviction went out over telegraphs worldwide, it threw a small Nevada town into chaos. This is the story of what happened when the lives of its citizens were impacted the Wilde news. It is a chronicle of hatred and prejudice with all its unintended and devastating consequences, and how love and friendship bring strength and healing.\u201d I loved the characters.\u00a0 I wanted to sit around and talk books with partners Mildred and Edra and their friends Gus and Charley.\u00a0 I wanted C.J. to play with Mabel.\u00a0 I despised bully Josie.
