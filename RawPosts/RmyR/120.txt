 C.J. recently celebrated his 100th day of first grade.  On that day, he had to fill in the blanks about what his life will be like when he is 100 years old.  He also had to draw a picture.  When I Am 100, By C.J. When I’m 100, it will be excellent!  First, I will go to sleep. Then, I will wear a sweater. Finally, I will say I love my kids. I think it will be excellent when I’m 100! Can we all take a moment to admire his fancy red cropped cardigan with ruffles and sassy pose (and blush and mascara)?
