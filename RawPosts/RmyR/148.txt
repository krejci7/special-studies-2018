   Atlanta…I’m coming for you.  This Wednesday through Sunday, I’ll be in town for Salon LGBTQ, the first national LGBTQ social media conference.   Friday, Oct. 18, at 2:15 p.m.: I’ll be part of a panel titled “Raising (and Writing About) the Next Generation of LGBTQ Kids.”  My co-panelists and fellow fierce mamas are none other than the super astounding Amelia (Huffington Post), Sarah Manley (Nerdy Apple) and Kelly Byrom (It’s a Bold Life). Charis Books will be there selling books and I’ll be signing.  Will I see you there? * * * In my post last week, I wrote about our family attending a high school football game to show Chase tackle football up close and personal because he has been begging to make the switch from flag football to full-contact football. I wrote plenty about C.J.’s reactions to the game – which ended up being the school’s Homecoming Game — but I didn’t write about Chase’s reactions. And, you called me on it.  And, it touched my heart because it reminded me that you care about BOTH of my children equally.  Sometimes I foolishly think that your focus is more on C.J.  Mine isn’t – of course – I love both of my kids with all of my heart no matter what. Any-who, Chase has decided that perhaps tackle football can wait a season or two.  😉  So, flag football it is for at least another six months to one year.  This mom is happy with his decision and doing a touchdown, end-zone-dance in her head because the longer I can keep him out of physical-harm’s way the better.   I’m not sure that I’ll ever be ready for Chase to start tackle football…not unless they let me get suited up and block him as he blocks for the runner guy with the ball (Whatever position that is called.  Receiver?  Running back?  Ball carrier?  Mr. Fastypants Runnerman?).
