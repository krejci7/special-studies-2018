Charis Books\u00a0will be there selling books and I\u2019ll be signing. \u00a0Will I see you there? * * * In my post last week, I wrote about our family attending a high school football game to show Chase tackle football up close and personal because he has been begging to make the switch from flag football to full-contact football. I wrote plenty about C.J.\u2019s reactions to the game \u2013 which ended up being the school\u2019s Homecoming Game \u2014 but I didn\u2019t write about Chase\u2019s reactions. And, you called me on it.\u00a0 And, it touched my heart because it reminded me that you care about BOTH of my children equally.\u00a0 Sometimes I foolishly think that your focus is more on C.J.\u00a0 Mine isn\u2019t \u2013 of course \u2013 I love both of my kids with all of my heart no matter what. Any-who, Chase has decided that perhaps tackle football can wait a season or two.\u00a0 \ud83d\ude09\u00a0 So, flag football it is for at least another six months to one year.\u00a0 This mom is happy with his decision and doing a touchdown, end-zone-dance in her head because the longer I can keep him out of physical-harm\u2019s way the better.\u00a0 \u00a0I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ll ever be ready for Chase to start tackle football\u2026not unless they let me get suited up and block him as he blocks for the runner guy with the ball (Whatever position that is called.\u00a0 Receiver?\u00a0 Running back?\u00a0 Ball carrier?\u00a0 Mr. Fastypants Runnerman?). \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
