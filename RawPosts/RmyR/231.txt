My two sons on graduation day. C.J.\u2019s last days of the school year were so themed that Walt Disney might have learned a thing or two.\u00a0 The culmination was a Hawaiian-themed graduation ceremony featuring \u00a0 a multi-song performance by the graduates, the crossing of the stage to accept diplomas and a potluck BBQ that offered no less than three different types of salad. When C.J. learned that graduation was a themed event, he immediately threw himself into planning his outfit.\u00a0 Duh. He went searching through his dress-up bins looking for his grass skirt that I brought back from Hawaii last summer.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t find it.\u00a0 Maybe because it had morphed into a tangled, grassy mess with at least one piece of gum in it and it ended up in the trash.\u00a0 Maybe. \u201cBut I NEED a grass skirt for my Hawaii graduation.\u00a0 I NEED to look like a hula girl,\u201d C.J. informed me. I, in turn, emailed Ms. Sensible to let her know that my son would be wearing at least some portion of a hula girl\u00a0 get-up to the graduation ceremony.\u00a0 We were going out of pre-k with a bang. I let him look for the long-gone grass skirt for two days, because it kept him busy.\u00a0 And because I would never admit to purging it. Ms. Sensible replied to my hi-my-son-wants-to-wear-a-skirt-to-graduation email.\u00a0 She let me know that a few of the girls in class planned on wearing grass skirts to graduation and that C.J. should feel free to do the same if he wanted to. We set off to Party City to replace the lost/trashed/missing grass skirt.\u00a0 As luck would have it, they were just setting up three aisles of luau party supplies that will remain intact until they are converted to the costume aisles for Halloween. C.J. in between his two best girl friends. C.J. had his pick of the litter.\u00a0 There were\u00a0grass skirts in a variety of colors: rainbow, pink, orange, green, brown, natural, blue and yellow.\u00a0 I saw the rainbow colored\u00a0skirt and knew that that would be the one C.J. would pick.\u00a0 I\u2019d stand there and let him go through the decision-making process.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t decide and he couldn\u2019t decide and he couldn\u2019t decide. \u201cI thought you\u2019d want the rainbow one for sure,\u201d I said. \u201cI think I want the blue one,\u201d he said after some more consideration. I was speechless, C.J. has never, ever, picked a blue anything.\u00a0 I was afraid he was picking it because, if he was going to wear a skirt for all of his classmates and their families to see he felt like it would be safer to wear a boy-colored one. \u201cBaby, it\u2019s up to you if you want to wear a grass skirt or not.\u00a0 It\u2019s your choice.\u00a0 And, you can pick any color you want,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cI want the blue one.\u00a0 I like the blue one.\u201d \u201cAre you sure?\u00a0 Once we buy it that\u2019s it, no going back, no changing your mind,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u00a0 I want the blue skirt.\u201d \u201cAlright then, let\u2019s go pay for it.\u201d We got home and he immediately put the skirt on.\u00a0 He moved throughout the house all evening very carefully, so that he wouldn\u2019t get his grass tangled.\u00a0 Before he went to bed that night, he laid out his outfit for the next day\u2019s graduation ceremony.\u00a0 Light blue and cream plaid shirt, khaki shorts, brown sandals, blue and green grass skirt, rainbow lei and a fake corsage for each wrist \u2014 one blue and one red.\u00a0 He put extra leave-in conditioner in his hair because he is convinced that the berry-smelling spray makes his hair grow longer and prettier faster.\u00a0 He got in bed early and didn\u2019t fall asleep until after 11 p.m.\u00a0 Tomorrow he would be a graduate. The next day, as we walked to his classroom, C.J. was beaming.\u00a0 He was the only one wearing a grass skirt; none of the girls in class had \u2014 as they said they would \u2014 worn a grass skirt.\u00a0 I was worried that C.J. would want to take his skirt off, that he wouldn\u2019t want to be the only one in a grass skirt.\u00a0 On the contrary, being the only one in a grass skirt and making his girl friends a little envious made him feel even more fabulous.\u00a0 As far as he was concerned he was the star of the graduation. \u201cI like your hula-girl skirt, C.J.,\u201d Molly said.\u00a0 \u201cMy mom wouldn\u2019t let me wear mine.\u00a0 You\u2019re lucky your mom let you wear yours.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d C.J. said. As I watched C.J. on the stage, I was one proud mama. \u201cLook at the little boy in the skirt!\u201d a woman said behind me and I heard a few laughs. C.J. getting his diploma. Yep, that was my son, up on the stage in a skirt for the world to see singing \u201cI\u2019ll Be Going to Kindergarten Next Year\u201d to the tune of \u201cShe\u2019ll Be Coming \u2018Round the Mountain.\u201d\u00a0 People could laugh and point all they wanted.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t care.\u00a0 Not today. After the graduation ceremony, I was in line for the potluck lunch when Ms. Sensible approached me. \u201cI just wanted to say that it was a such a pleasure having C.J. in my class this year,\u201d she said. \u201cOh my gosh, are you kidding me?\u00a0 I was going to thank you for being so amazing.\u00a0 I know that we are high maintenance and you\u2019ve never taught a kid like C.J. and you taught him with an open mind and an open heart and that\u2019s all we ask for,\u201d I gushed. \u201cWell, I really enjoyed C.J. He allowed me to learn something new, I love learning new things.\u00a0 And, I\u2019ve watched him grow so much emotionally, socially and academically.\u00a0 I\u2019m just really proud of him.\u00a0 I hope you\u2019ll stop by to visit me next year when he\u2019s in kindergarten,\u201d she said. \u201cFor sure.\u00a0 Of course,\u201d I replied. Kindergarten.\u00a0 It\u2019s 87 days away and I have no idea what C.J.\u2019s next teacher will be like.\u00a0 I hope that she\u2019ll be a lot like Ms. Sensible, and Ms. Sunshine who came before her.
