 This has been a very crazy week, with C.J. starting first grade and his brother Chase starting fifth grade.  I’m in the middle of writing a post about their first week of school.  Until I finish that, enjoy this: My Advice To Parents Of Girly Boys, Parents.com I welcome a lot of emails into my inbox every day and many of them are from parents or caregivers seeking advice on raising a gender creative child.  This column contains my top seven tips. Lori Duron On Finding Vulnerability And Sincerity Through Writing, Biographile.com If you’ve followed my blog over the last two and a half years, I’m sure you’ve noticed a change in my writing voice.  I had been using wit and sass most of my life to protect myself and appear less vulnerable than I really was. I mistakenly thought that people wouldn’t appreciate the sincere and raw version of me. Most importantly, I didn’t think that I would like that version of myself. I was wrong on both accounts.  Learn how a very special book editor helped me find vulnerability and sincerity through writing. Raising My Rainbow Highlights The Challenges Of Raising A Gender Creative Child, Southern California Public Radio In this 10-minute radio interview, I discuss how public reactions to C.J. make me feel, how bullying led to Chase talking about suicide and C.J.’s future. Thank you to all of you who have purchased my book and helped me to inspire a conversation that raises awareness of, understanding about and acceptance for gender creative kids.  Let’s keep the conversation going – kids like C.J. deserve it.
