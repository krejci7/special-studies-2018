From three-year-old C.J. wanting to be Snow White and us convincing him to be a skeleton to now \u2013 when I steam his dress and watch in awe as he applies makeup using skills he\u2019s acquired watching countless tutorials on YouTube. Our boy is growing and maturing. The past few months he\u2019s been drawn to mid-century design, vintage pinup fashion and 1950\u2019s culture. So, when he saw a 1950\u2019s car hop girl costume, his annual costume hunt quickly came to an end. Of course, because C.J. has to use his creativity and love for all things creepy and quirky whenever he can, his waitress has a backstory. She was murdered with a pair of pink fuzzy dice while delivering an order. Cue the excuse posthumous makeup. Today, Yahoo! Parenting is running a slideshow of C.J.\u2019s Halloween costumes over the years with my commentary about our evolution as parents of a differently gendered child. Check it out!
