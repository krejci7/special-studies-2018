C.J. taught me that this week. C.J. is this week\u2019s \u201cSpecial Bear\u201d in his kindergarten class. It\u2019s supposed to be the highlight of the school year for him. Instead it\u2019s been one panic attack after another. This week is all about C.J. If you knew my son at home, you\u2019d assume he\u2019s made for weeks like this when all eyes are on him. At home he acts as if he\u2019s born to shine, sparkle and steal every scene in this feature film called life. When talking about his future, he\u2019s gotten in the habit of starting every sentence with \u201cWhen I\u2019m famous\u2026\u201d At home, he\u2019s no wallflower. Things are much different at school. This year he works every day to blend in and avoid doing something that will call attention to himself and his gender nonconformity. He\u2019s in constant fear that the wrong classmate will find out that he likes girl stuff. Every day of this week, C.J. is the center of attention. We had the classroom teddy bear with us all weekend. We were supposed to have adventures, take pictures and include them with captions in the class journal for the students to see on Monday. \u201cLet me take your picture with the bear for the journal,\u201d I said on Friday night as C.J. sat eating a bowl of ice cream. \u201cNO! Don\u2019t take my picture! I\u2019m wearing my nightgown! I don\u2019t want them to know I like girl stuff!\u201d \u201cOh, okay. We\u2019ll start taking pictures tomorrow,\u201d I said. Every photo taken with the bear the next day was well thought out and completely staged. At his request, we had to scan C.J. and the background for \u201cgirl clothes\u201d and \u201cgirl toys\u201d before he allowed us to take any pictures of him and that damn bear. We are horrible at noticing our boy dressed as a girl or playing with girl toys now. They used to stick out like a sore thumb. Now they don\u2019t. I gladly handed over the bear and journal to C.J.\u2019s teacher on Monday. Then, I realized that for Tuesday, we had to create a custom 11\u00d714 collage of photos of C.J. and a list of his favorite things. We had a questionnaire to guide us. \u201cWhat are your favorite things to do?\u201d I read off of the questionnaire to C.J. \u201cDancing and cutting my dolls hair and playing with my dolls and drawing me in beautiful dresses,\u201d he said. I started to write down his answer. I had a feeling that he would stop me. But, if he didn\u2019t, if he was fine with giving his classmates the truth, I would be too. \u201cYou can\u2019t write that!\u201d C.J. said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I really like, not what I want the class to know I like. Tell them I like to play on the iPad. But, don\u2019t tell them I play the dressmaker app. Or the makeover app.\u201d \u201cOkay. What\u2019s your favorite movie?\u201d \u201cTangled. But don\u2019t tell them that. Tell them I like Toy Story.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d I said as I wrote. \u201cWhich Toy Story? 1, 2 or 3?\u201d \u201cThree because it has Barbie in it, but don\u2019t tell them that\u2019s why. Just tell them I like three best.\u201d \u201cOkay. What is your favorite TV show?\u201d \u201cJessie and Shake It Up. But don\u2019t tell them that. Tell them I like Kickin\u2019 It or maybe Good Luck Charlie is okay.\u201d The simple questionnaire was an exhausting process. The accompanying poster board had to be covered with C.J.\u2019s favorite photos of himself. C.J. insisted that I only use photos of him \u201clooking and acting like a boy.\u201d I imagine that for the vast majority of parents of boys it\u2019s easy to find a picture of their boy looking and acting like a boy. For me it\u2019s not. I struggled and found nine from the last year. In three of them he\u2019s wearing only the color pink (a polo shirt in three shots and board shorts in one). He allowed me to use those. When we were done with the poster board C.J. said it looked \u201cjust okay.\u201d \u201cWhat could we do to make it look better?\u201d I asked him, wanting him to like it. \u201cMake it pink and rainbow and add glitter,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do that,\u201d I replied. \u201cNo.\u201d Today he had to take his favorite book to school for his teacher read to the class. At first he was afraid that he\u2019d get teased if he took his real favorite book, but he took it anyway and I\u2019m glad he did. He took Perez Hilton\u2019s The Boy With Pink Hair. \u201cHe was born that way-The Boy with Pink Hair\u2026Life is not easy being pink\u2026But when you have a best friend who appreciates your uniqueness and parents who are loving and supportive, you can do just about anything.\u201d \u2014 The Boy With Pink Hair Tomorrow he\u2019s supposed to take his favorite toy to share with the class. He won\u2019g do that. He won\u2019t take his cupcake princess doll, his ballerina nutcracker or one of his Barbies. So he\u2019s taking a snow globe and will pretend that he loves it. On Friday he takes his family to share with the class. His dad, brother and I will stand up there with him in front of the class and support him proudly. No matter what he likes in private or public, we like him just the way he is.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 22 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
