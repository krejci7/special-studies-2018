As I listened, it struck me how much more accepting and nonjudgmental Santas have gotten over the years. When C.J. was little and asked for \u201cgirl toys,\u201d Santa would make a face and/or a small little quip. This Santa just smiled and nodded. Then again, he told the kid in front of us that he was on parole, so maybe he was just happy to be out of jail for the holidays to find some solid seasonal work. The items on the top of C.J.\u2019s wish list are\u2026 pc: American Girl Logan doll by American Girl: This year was the first time (in their 31-year history) that American Girl introduced a boy doll. His name is Logan and he is reportedly a hipster who plays the drums in a band. \u201cBut, you don\u2019t even really play with your American Girl dolls that much anymore,\u201d I said, trying to save myself $115. \u201cI play with them sometimes. And, besides, I have to show American Girl that they did the right thing and should be proud of themselves for finally making an American Boy.\u201d I hope my $115 makes American Girl feel super proud of themselves. pc: Gap Denim jacket from the Gap: I\u2019m in trouble. C.J is starting to care about brand names. He wants a denim jacket and specifically said on his list \u201cit should be from the Gap or Levi\u2019s \u2013 NOT FROM TARGET!!!\u201d Zinger. Those three exclamation points really made me listen up. Little does he know, I consider myself lucky that Gap and Levi\u2019s are the fanciest brands he could think of. All the bath bombs in the world: There\u2019s nothing C.J. loves more than a warm bath after a long day of fifth grade and gymnastics. A former bubble bath aficionado, he now prefers the more effervescent bath bomb. He has requested one for every day of the year until next Christmas. He is not getting that many. A DIY bath bomb kit: Perfect. I\u2019ll get him the kit and he can make his own bath bombs for the year. I\u2019m sure that won\u2019t be a messy project. pc: Target Conair Infiniti Pro Rainbow Curling Iron with a 1-inch barrel: He\u2019s 10 years old. How does he know he wants a 1-inch barrel and not 1.25 or 1.5? Batiste dry shampoo: Don\u2019t ask me. He sees the commercials and is convinced he needs it to refresh his hair in between washes. Sewing basket filled with supplies: \u201cAnd not a toy one for kids, a real legit one!\u201d The softest blanket in the world: I hope the one I got for $8 at Kohl\u2019s on Black Friday works. Fingerling: Who would name a child\u2019s toy a Fingerling? Whoever did was smart, because those things are hard as hell to find. The first two I ordered from China via Amazon never arrived and were hard to get refunded. pc: Amazon \u00a0 As sassy and particular as C.J. can be, I know he\u2019d be happy with any gift I picked for him. He\u2019s full of the Christmas spirit. After all, his sense of wonder isn\u2019t confined to the holidays. It\u2019s a year-round thing. I hope that you and yours have a wonderful next few weeks.
