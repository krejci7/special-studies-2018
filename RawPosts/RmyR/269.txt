I WANT THAT CAR!\u201d C.J. scared the crap out of me. We were out running errands and he let go of my hand in a parking lot and made a mad dash for the car of his dreams.  Why, yes, that is the official car of Lipstick Bail Bonds and he was standing next to it jumping up and down.  \u201cCan we get it? Can we get it? Please! It\u2019s pink and has kisses on it. I want it! Take my picture by it!\u201d People were looking and C.J. was posing like he was on American\u2019s Next Top Model. I took his picture with it like he was meeting Tyra Banks. \u201cHi,\u201d a man said awkwardly from behind me. Of course the driver of the car would come out and catch us touching and photographing his vehicle. \u201cOh, um, hi,\u201d I said with my sweetest smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but my son loves your car.\u201d \u201cNo problem. Do you all want some t-shirts?,\u201d he asked. \u201cYES!,\u201d screamed C.J. The nice man from Lipstick Bail Bonds gave us stickers, air freshners and tank tops. Who knew that bail bondsmen carried so many chotchkies with them. Here is C.J. wearing the tank top that he selected. He\u2019s layered it over a hospital gown and paired it with his rain boots. Naturally. Twelve years from now, he fully expects to see that car in our driveway on his birthday.    ", "feedtitle": "Page 27 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
