At C.J.\u2019s Open House the walls were covered in colorful masterpieces.\u00a0 One lesson was based on The Very Hungry Caterpillar\u00a0by Eric Carle and the accompanying craft was a construction paper caterpillar made of circles in a color-specific pattern.\u00a0 Here\u2019s what the \u201cperfect\u201d caterpillar looked like.  And, here\u2019s what C.J.\u2019s caterpillar looked like.  He said he got \u201cfus-ter-rated\u201d because he wanted to make the caterpillar a girl AND a boy, but he was supposed to be going in a pattern.\u00a0 He also decided to ditch the antennae in favor of long hair.\u00a0 C.J.\u2019s caterpillar was hard to miss. I\u2019m about to go way off topic, so stay with me.\u00a0 There\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wondering for several weeks now.\u00a0 Do you think that it is possible for a homosexual person to not have to come out of the closet.\u00a0 I don\u2019t mean stay closeted for always and ever.\u00a0 I mean never even enter the closet.\u00a0 For instance, I\u2019ve asked my oldest son if he thinks anybody in his class is cute.\u00a0 I\u2019m careful how I phrase it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t ask if he thinks any of the girls are cute.\u00a0 I leave it open so that he can answer honestly.\u00a0 Do you think an LGBT\u00a0youth could grow up and never step foot in the closet (at least with immediate family), thus making the coming out process (with the immediate family) obsolete?\u00a0 Can a family be so okay with homosexuality that, say, a fifth grade boy could tell his mom very comfortably that the boy in class in a Chargers jersey and still outgrowing his baby fat (or Baby Phat, who knows) is totes amazeballs? Please let me know what you think.\u00a0 I\u2019ve asked around and gotten very surprising answers.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 30 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
