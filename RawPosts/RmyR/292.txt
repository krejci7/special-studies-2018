In. My. Eyes. That\u2019ll teach me to watch CNN. Anderson \u201cEye Candy\u201d Cooper\u2019s report on \u201cThe Sissy Boy Experiment\u201d made my heart break. Snapped right into tiny pieces.  \u201cThe Sissy Boy Experiment\u201d was experimental therapy conducted on a five-year-old boy named \u201cKraig\u201d in the 1970s at UCLA in an attempt to make him less effeminate and prevent him from growing into a gay adult. It was government-funded and considered to be a great success; even though the family says that it was disastrous, the boy grew up to be gay and, then, committed suicide, but not on his first attempt. Catch up on the CNN coverage here: http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/06/07/sissy.boy.experiment/index.html For more in-depth coverage of this story, Box Turtle Bulletin has a thorough examination of the impact that this \u201cresearch\u201d had on Kirk Murphy (\u201cKraig\u201d) and his family. http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/ Also on CNN, Ann Coulter declined to answer Piers Morgan when he asked what she would do if she had a gay child. For me, her silence confirms that she shouldn\u2019t have children. But, that\u2019s just me. http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/abraham/detail?entry_id=90553 God, grant me the serenity to be a better mother than Ann Coulter would be and the courage not to send my child to UCLA to be experimented on; and, wisdom, because we are different. Oh, and, watch over Anderson Cooper, too. Amen.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 30 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
