(He\u2019s not the late-80s teen heart throb Chad Allen who I had a massive crush on once upon a Our House with Brenda Walsh and the Oatmeal Man) C.J.\u2019s Chad Alan is a designer, artist, YouTuber and the founder of a movement called B.O.L.D. \u2013 which stands for Boys Openly Liking Dolls.\u00a0 Through B.O.L.D. and his YouTube channel, Chad encourages gender nonconforming kids to be bold, be themselves, stand up for what they believe in and bravely like what they want to like. C.J. found Chad while we were searching YouTube for Monster High content (after he got tired of watching cake decorating videos, which I found made me the dangerous combination of bored and hungry). \u00a0He hasn\u2019t left Chad\u2019s channel in more than two weeks. Chad makes amazing beds and things for the Monster High Ghouls and other dolls.\u00a0 His videos and tutorials also feature pop music. \u2013 which C.J. sometimes dances around to in his room paying no attention to the video\u2019s content. \u00a0Chad and C.J. may be kindred spirits; Chad just doesn\u2019t know it yet. \u00a0When recently asked what he wants to be when he grows up, C.J. replied \u201cChad Alan.\u201d Well, one day last week while I was at work, C.J. and his dad followed Chad\u2019s tutorial for making a stone bed for Rochelle Goyle.  When I got home from work, I was reminded \u2013 yet again \u2013 that Matt is an amazing father and husband.\u00a0 How many men would spend hours making a bed for their son\u2019s doll?\u00a0 I mean, it even required a trip to the craft and fabric store. With the fabric that Matt and C.J. purchased (based on Chad\u2019s tutorial), I spent that evening and the following day sewing with C.J.\u00a0 We made the blanket and four pillows.\u00a0 C.J.\u2019s favorite part of sewing is pushing the foot pedal.\u00a0 He especially likes it when I tell him to go slow and he pushes the pedal hard to make it go fast and then he says, \u201cwhoops, my foot slipped\u201d with an impish grin.  C.J. has been having a rough few weeks at school because he is different and because he likes \u201cgirl things.\u201d\u00a0 Chad Alan and his YouTube channel make C.J. feel like he fits in.\u00a0 Chad makes it cool to be B.O.L.D.\u00a0 And, that makes Chad pretty cool in my son\u2019s eyes and mine. \u00a0Matt thinks he\u2019s pretty cool too, but wishes that he didn\u2019t post a new bed tutorial almost daily. \u00a0How are we supposed to keep up with that?
