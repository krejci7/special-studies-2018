With the adults. Not the child. This week a transgender rights group announced that it has filed a discrimination complaint in Colorado on behalf of a first-grader who was born a boy but identifies and presents as a girl. The girl is recognized by the state as a female and has attended elementary school only as a female. She has always used the girls\u2019 restrooms, until this December when she was told that she had to use either the boys\u2019 bathroom or the unisex bathroom in the school office. I\u2019ve been asked to comment about the legal and civil rights that the little girl has or doesn\u2019t have. I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t live in her state or know her laws. But, I can tell you that I\u2019m sure there are bigger issues in Colorado and the country than where the little girl goes to wash her hands and powder her nose. Adults, the school, the district and the state should focus on those issues and on trying to make this world a better place for everybody, instead of making it a worse place for a first-grader. If you ask me, the school administrators aren\u2019t thinking about their student\u2019s educational, mental or emotional health \u2013 they are thinking about her genitalia.\u00a0 And, that\u2019s disturbing. \u00a0http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/27/us/colorado-transgender-girl-school/index.html * * * These frat boys at Emerson College helped to restore some of my faith in humanity this week, when they announced that they were raising money to fund \u201ctop surgery\u201d for one of their members who is transgender and recently had the surgery declined by his insurance company. \u201cPhi Alpha Tau members, defying the conventional stereotype of a fraternity, launched a campaign on an online fundraising site \u2014 Indiegogo.com \u2014 with a goal of collecting the $8,100 needed for the procedure, scheduled for May.\u201d They raised more than $16,000. \u00a0http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/27/us/massachusetts-fraternity-sex-change/index.html * * * Who wants to go to the 2013 Gender Spectrum Conference in Berkeley, CA, this July?
