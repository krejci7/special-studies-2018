From Oscars.com C.J. was not interested in the crafts; he was interested in the red carpet and the show.\u00a0 It all started when he caught a glimpse of Kristin Chenoweth interviewing people. \u201cIs that the girl from Dance Moms?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not Chloe,\u201d I said laughing. \u201cIs that a girl or a lady?\u201d he asked dumbfounded. \u201cIt\u2019s a lady.\u201d \u201cA real lady?\u201d \u201cYes, a real lady.\u00a0 She\u2019s older than me,\u201d I said, mostly because I like to point out when people are older than me.\u00a0 It makes me feel full of youth and vigor. \u201cShe\u2019s a little real lady with a little girl voice?\u201d he asked still confused. \u201cYeah.\u00a0 You should hear her sing, you would love it.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s that?!\u00a0 I want her hair!\u201d \u201cJessica Chastain,\u201d I said.\u00a0 Her and C.J. have similar color hair. \u201cI\u2019m going to grow my hair out like that,\u201d he decided. \u201cOkay.\u201d\u00a0 This was a different Oscar viewing experience than I was used to.\u00a0 Nana Grab Bags is pretty quiet when we watch together.\u00a0 C.J. is not. From Oscars.com There was Jane Fonda is a shocking yellow dress that I didn\u2019t particularly care for. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a fun color yellow!\u201d C.J. said.\u00a0 My son has a thing for colors that pop. Then, along came Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis with her puppy purse. \u201cIf I ever went to the night when everybody dresses fancy, I would totally have that purse!\u201d\u00a0 He was now referring to the Oscars as \u201cthe night when everybody dresses fancy.\u201d\u00a0 Strange, because I was in sweats. \u201cIs Uncle Uncle going to be on this show?\u201d he asked out of the blue, stealing kettle corn from my bowl. \u201cHe wishes,\u201d I said with a snort. \u201cBut, it\u2019s by his house.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t get invited?\u201d \u201cNope.\u201d Then, came C.J.\u2019s favorite dress of the night, which really confused me because it wasn\u2019t flashy, showy, sparkly or poufy.\u00a0 C.J.\u2019s favorite dress was the one worn by Jamie Foxx\u2019s daughter, even though (as he commented) \u201cit was a little inappropriate around her belly.\u201d \u201cOh.\u00a0 Em.\u00a0 Gee.\u00a0 Mama, that lady is wearing tennis shoes!\u201d \u201cShe made Bradley Cooper, so she can wear whatever shoes she wants,\u201d I said. From Oscars.com Then, he saw Halle Berry\u2019s dress and was in shock. \u201cThat dress is totally inappropriate.\u00a0 You can almost see her boobs.\u00a0 That was not a smart choice.\u201d\u00a0 C.J. has been working on making smart choices for more than a year now.\u00a0 According to C.J., Halle Berry\u2019s dress choice was not smart. \u201cOhhhhh, now that\u2019s my favorite dress!\u201d he said when he saw Anne Hathaway. \u201cI like it because it is pink, but I wish her hair was long like yours mama,\u201d he said smiling up at me and stealing my iced tea.\u00a0 If I cut my hair, I\u2019d break his heart. \u201cMama, what dress is your favorite?\u201d \u201cStacy Keibler\u2019s.\u201d From Oscars.com \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that fun,\u201d he said shaking his head. The show eventually started and soon Charlize Theron was dancing across the stage (though my eyes were on Channing Tatum). \u201cIf she\u2019s going to dance like that, she really should be singing,\u201d C.J. said with his right leg crossed over his left and his arms folded. Seth McFarlane started singing a song about boobs, which elicited giggles from C.J. Jennifer Aniston appeared on stage in a vivid red dress to present an award. \u201cWow, there are a lot of ladies looking sexy tonight!\u201d C.J. exclaimed. \u201cThere sure are,\u201d Nana Grab Bags said in agreeance.\u00a0 I gave them both a look and she just smiled at me and shrugged her shoulders like she couldn\u2019t possibly disagree with him because he was speaking the truth. Brave won for Best Animated Film, which was disappointing to C.J. because he was voting for Wreck It Ralph.\u00a0 Then, he saw Director Mark Andrews get up from his seat to accept the Oscar.\u00a0 Andrews was wearing a kilt. \u201cLook at his skirt!\u00a0 Look at his skirt!\u201d he pointed bouncing up and down on the couch. \u201cWow.\u00a0 That\u2019s a nice skirt!\u201d I admired. \u201cIs he gender nonconforming?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I like his style.\u201d\u00a0 I said. \u201cMe too, I think he looks the prettiest.\u00a0 When I get invited to the night when everybody dresses fancy I\u2019m gonna wear that man\u2019s skirt and that little girl\u2019s dog purse.\u00a0 And, have red hair like that one lady.\u201d There, it\u2019s all settled; C.J. has selected his Oscar outfit.\u00a0 Now he just needs an invite.
