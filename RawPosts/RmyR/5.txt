Due to the extent of the injury, I was forced into early retirement from law enforcement. While my family was happy I was leaving a dangerous career, I had many reservations about being forced into retirement. Yes, the thought of sleeping during nighttime hours was something I had craved for years; but, I knew I would miss the excitement, quick thinking and spontaneous problem solving I did on the job. I became the primary caregiver parent for our two boys while Lori started working more. A few weeks in my new role it became clear that I wouldn\u2019t miss out on excitement, quick thinking and spontaneous problem solving. C.J. would provide it. Chase has always been a very easy child. He\u2019s easy-going, he listens, he rarely argues, he\u2019s not impulsive and he never raises his voice in frustration or to make his point. C.J. however, is a totally different story. This past summer was my first summer home with the boys full time. By August, I couldn\u2019t wait for school to start. These are the kind of pics Matt and C.J. send me at work. I\u2019ve worked through triple-digit Southern California summers on the street in a wool uniform atop a bulletproof vest or locked in sweltering stake out cars with no air conditioning. Those summers weren\u2019t the hardest. Summer 2017 was the hardest because every day I had to match wits with a strong, sassy, opinionated, confident, creative, spontaneous 10-year-old who was bored and adjusting to having dad \u2013 not mom \u2013 home the most. Nothing was easy. If I said black, he said white. If I wanted yogurt, he wanted ice cream. If I wanted the pool, he wanted the beach. Everything was a battle. If I never hear \u201cMom doesn\u2019t do it that way\u2026\u201d again, it will be too soon. He would tell me when I was having a bad hair day and needed to put a hat on or if, worse yet, I was wearing an unflattering outfit. How can swim trunks look \u201cnot swim-y\u201d and a tank top look \u201ctoo arm-y\u201d? While Chase was busy with high school football practices and weight lifting, I was shuttling C.J from art camp to tennis lessons to sewing camp. It was more than 100 damn degrees and I was in and out of the car carrying racquets, sewing baskets and more clay projects than we have space for. Every day, after every camp, C.J. told me how I didn\u2019t pack a snack, I packed the wrong snack or I packed too much snack (how is that even possible). Matt lets C.J. do his makeup to work on his skills. When I was working, I used to envy stay-at-home parents. I pictured parents \u2013 especially moms \u2013 enjoying free time with their kids. During the summer I pictured them lounging by the pool with their mom-friends and their kids, reading magazines, gossiping and maybe sipping on an adult beverage. I assumed they felt kid-free as their children entertained themselves in the pool. During school holidays, I pictured the stay-at-home moms sleeping in, doing a craft stress-free, watching a movie and feeling happy, relaxed and refreshed. I\u2019d been wrong. So wrong. That\u2019s not stay-at-home life; I\u2019m sorry for ever thinking it was. I know better now. Occasionally, I call Lori at work to vent about stay-at-home life. \u201cI have to go. Work is crazy-busy today,\u201d she says to me. That used to be my line. Now it\u2019s hers and it\u2019s hard to hear. I know I can be difficult to deal with. I\u2019m confident and loud. I have difficulty hiding my true emotions. I\u2019m honest to a fault. I can be impulsive. Being a stay-at-home parent, I\u2019ve realized that C.J. is exactly like me. Lori always said so, but I never listened. How could an effeminate little boy who wears skirts and plays with dolls be exactly like me? But, he is, my feminine son is exactly like masculine me. It took me being home with him full-time to see how glaringly obvious it is. Matt took C.J. to the church we were married at. .While spending countless hours with him in the car or at home doing homework and projects, we have grown incredibly close. For a father and son to have such different interests, pursuits and goals, we have the same humor, personality and sarcasm. Since being home with him full-time, I\u2019ve seen his assuredness and confidence grow. He\u2019s become stronger. That\u2019s not to say he\u2019s become more masculine, it\u2019s to say he\u2019s become more confident and unapologetic in his feminine gender expression. He knows he can be exactly who he is and he has all of my love and support. He can sashay into school wearing French braids, carrying his pink emoji lunchbox and he \u2013 and all of his schoolmates \u2013 know that I\u2019ll greet him with a smile and hug when school gets out. Being the primary caregiver parent has changed me, too. I\u2019ve grown. I retired before age 40. Most people say I\u2019m lucky, and I am, but it also takes some adjusting to. I went from being a cop to being the parent responsible for a lot of the emotional care of our children. I\u2019ve traded traditional gender roles with my wife to stay home with our blue teenager and pink boy. Now, I know where things are at the grocery store and in the pantry and my wife doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s my job to know when we\u2019re almost out of toilet paper and what flavor jelly the boys prefer at the moment. And kayaking on the lake by our house. As much as we\u2019ve prided ourselves in ignoring society\u2019s ideas of traditional gender roles, we\u2019ve had some adjusting to do. At times, it\u2019s been challenging for our relationship and my friendships with other guys. Longtime guy friends think it\u2019s weird that I search Pinterest for recipes and know when the local bakery has 50 percent off cupcakes (Tuesdays) and cookies (Thursdays). Our lives have been full of adjustments. The adjustments were hard for a while. The loss of my professional identity. The physical pain of my injury. The role reversal in our marriage. Getting used to being the stay-at-home parent. But, as the four of us always do, we found our way. I\u2019m so proud to be the father of our boys and grateful to be able to be home with them. I realize now more than ever that I missed a lot when I was working. This summer was difficult and challenging and the school year couldn\u2019t come fast enough. Now, I see winter break winking at me from a few weeks away and I look the other way while I can. But, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.   ", "feedtitle": "Raising My Rainbow"}
