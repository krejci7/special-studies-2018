We were in New York to meet the wonderful group of people who are working to make my book a success.\u00a0 They are people who have come to know our family, care about our message and believe wholeheartedly that it needs to be shared with the world. While meeting all of them and finally putting faces to names and voices, I was reminded of how lucky I am and how thankful I am for my blog\u2019s readers. If I completely oversimplify it, this is how my journey to becoming a published author went. I started a blog.\u00a0 Some people read it and liked it.\u00a0 They shared it with others.\u00a0 One reader posted a link to it in the comment section of a hugely popular news and gossip website.\u00a0 An agent saw it, clicked it, liked it, emailed me and helped me get a book deal. Condensed like that, it leaves out a massive amount of excitement, anxiety, struggle, contemplation, thought and wine. We went to New York to meet my agent for the first time.\u00a0 We also met with \u201cmy team.\u201d\u00a0 I have a team.\u00a0 How weird is that?\u00a0 Here we all are.
