The Center School is a progressive, independent day school that offers rigorous education for deep thinkers and creative spirits. Seriously, everything about the school and its community of faculty, staff, students and parents have me enraptured and wishing that C.J. could go to The Center School or a school like it. The school has become a safe haven for gender creative kiddos. As of next year, the school will have four transgender and two gender non-conforming students and a gender creative staff member. How cool is that? Even cooler? They just launched a Raising Rainbows Scholarship in my honor.  The Center School\u2019s\u00a0Raising Rainbows scholarship, established in 2015, provides tuition support for Center School students who are transgender, gender nonconforming, gender creative, or who have family members who are.\u00a0\u00a0 The scholarship was inspired by a beautiful,\u00a0brave Center\u00a0School\u00a0transgender\u00a0student who transitioned when she was in kindergarten. In addition the initiators\u00a0of this fund recognize the wonderful\u00a0Lori Duron and the loving\u00a0story of her gender creative son, as added inspiration.\u00a0\u00a0 Contributions to this fund are fully tax deductible and support students\u2019 academic and social\u00a0journey at The\u00a0Center School, which celebrates each child\u2019s unique path\u00a0in the world. Consider giving and spreading the word. * * *  This John Oliver video is by far my favorite thing on the interwebs this week. It\u2019s well-worth 15 minutes of your time \u2014 or even a few minutes because he pretty much nails it from start to finish. (Thanks to Leslie for tipping me off to this one.) \u201cSome transgender people do undergo hormone therapy or sexual reassignment surgery as part of their transition; some do not. And interestingly, their decision on this matter is, medically speaking, none of your f*cking business,\u201d John Oliver said on HBO\u2019s Last Week Tonight, in re media questioning of transgender interview guests\u2019 body parts. Singled out for shaming: Barbara Walters, Wendy Williams, Katie Couric, Larry King, etc. Oliver\u2019s note to media: \u201cIf you\u2019re still wondering, \u2018What do I call a transgender person, it\u2019s so confusing,\u2019 actually it\u2019s pretty simple \u2013 call them whatever they want to be called.\u201d  * * *  MTV\u2019s True Life series is currently casting for its next season. One episode is titled \u201cI Am GenderQueer\u201d and one is titled \u201cI Have A Transgender Parent.\u201d If either of these topics relate to your life or\u00a0you know someone who would be perfect for the casting. Please email\u00a0truelife@punchedinthehead.com.  * * *  Grief is a real bitch. Thanks for the comments, notes, thoughts and prayers as we adjust to life without Nana Grab Bags. Every days sucks a little less. xoxo, Lori   ", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
