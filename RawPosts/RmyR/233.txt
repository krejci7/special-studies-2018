It was the last week of school and the Orange County Mommy Mafia was out in full force giving each day a theme and a party and a sense of panic that had me constantly feeling like I was forgetting some important detail.\u00a0 They scuttled about campus in their Lululemon yoga pants, clutching their stainless steel commuter mugs filled with the organic coffee they picked up at Trader Joe\u2019s over the weekend while they were loading up on supplies for the class ice cream social, board game mixer, pizza party, beach blanket BBQ, popcorn and movie mid-day madness and bubble blowing farewell ceremony.\u00a0 I watched them all from the comfort of my dirty car, while wearing my work pants that give me a severe muffin top and drinking yesterday\u2019s coffee that I had managed to burn when I reheated it in the microwave. I remember when I was in school and there was only one celebration, it was called the final bell ringing, marking the start of summer.\u00a0 That was the \u201cOfficial Party,\u201d the bell, it lasted five seconds.\u00a0 How times have changed, I didn\u2019t even have time to write a blog post this week because I was busy meeting the demands of The Mafia and trying to keep up with my two sons and the days\u2019 many themes and parties so that I didn\u2019t seem like a clueless, uncaring, uninvolved mom. I have to admit, I burst out in insane laughter when one of the boys\u2019 room mom sent an email reminding us that there was a party the next day and she still needed \u201cmultiple parents to supply wet toppings.\u00a0 Squirtable chocolate?\u201d Excuse me?\u00a0 I nearly showed my true colors.\u00a0 Alas, I was able to control myself without replying to the entire class using the hashtags #roommomepicfail and #ivegotyourwettoppingsrighthere. For C.J., Monday was pirate day. \u201cC.J., do you want to dress like a pirate for school today,\u201d I asked. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not fun,\u201d he said with a look of disappointment. He wasn\u2019t quite as glum hours later when I picked him up from school and he was wearing the awesome pirate hat that he made in class.\u00a0 He customized his Jolly Roger, complete with rainbow wig and purple grill. Another day that week was Sports Day. \u201cWhat do you want to wear for Sports Day?\u00a0 You can wear your baseball uniform or your soccer uniform or\u2026.\u201d \u201cI want to be a cheerleader!\u201d C.J. interrupted.\u00a0 \u201cI already have my uniform, you know the pink one with glitter?\u201d Oh I knew which one he was talking about.\u00a0 It was two sizes too small, ripped and stained.\u00a0 Nana Grab Bags had worked her sewing magic on it a few times, but you can only do so much when working with a $15-dollar, imitation satin number. \u201cBaby, that uniform is too small and too worn out to wear to school,\u201d I said honestly.\u00a0 It was a tattered mess. \u201cOkaaaaaayyyyyy, I guess I\u2019ll wear my baseball uniform,\u201d he said lacking enthusiasm.\u00a0 \u201cWhen\u2019s pajama day?\u201d \u201cFriday.\u201d \u201cThat will be MY day.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to wear my Little Mermaid jammies to school,\u201d he declared. I looked at my husband.\u00a0 Were we really going to let our son wear girl\u2019s pajamas to school?\u00a0 Considering he doesn\u2019t own a pair of boy\u2019s pajamas our options were limited or I needed to go shopping.\u00a0 Not that I ever mind a good excuse to go shopping. \u201cAre you cool with him wearing girl pajamas to school?\u201d I asked C.J.\u2019s Dad later that night, away from the boys. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t care.\u00a0 School\u2019s almost over,\u201d he said. \u201cI agree.\u201d It has been a tough school year dealing with gender issues.\u00a0 In a way we were waving our rainbow flag to mark the ending of a struggle.\u00a0 Not defeat, just an end. I emailed C.J.\u2019s teacher Ms. Sensible to warn her that on Friday C.J. would be wearing his three-piece deluxe Little Mermaid pajamas that he had recently purchased on sale at the Disney Store to school.\u00a0 Pants with fish-scale tail design, white top with Ariel on it and optional layered skirt, which C.J. has never considered optional; to him, it\u2019s mandatory. She replied the next day before noon letting me know that C.J. was welcome to wear anything that he was comfortable in.. I picked C.J. up from school.\u00a0 He sat in his booster seat wearing his baseball uniform. \u201cMommy, today Ms. Sensible told me that I could wear my Little Mermaid jammies to school for pajama day.\u00a0 She said I could wear whatever makes me comfortable and that she\u2019ll tell the kids not to make fun of me.\u00a0 She said that people will like me no matter what,\u201d he said. \u201cMs. Sensible is right.\u00a0 She\u2019s a good teacher.\u201d \u201cSo, can I wear my Little Mermaid jammies to school tomorrow?\u201d \u201cNo, tomorrow is crazy hair day.\u201d \u201cWhat!?!?!\u00a0 I LOVE crazy hair day!!!!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s odd, you\u2019ve never had a crazy hair day before,\u201d I said smiling at C.J. in the rearview mirror as I drove. \u201cI know, but I know I\u2019m just going to love it.\u201d C.J. won the award for craziest hair at crazy hair day.\u00a0 Or so he told us, only for me to find out later that there was no award given.\u00a0 My kid has a good imagination, or he\u2019s a liar. Finally it was Friday.\u00a0 Finally it was pajama day.\u00a0 C.J. had allowed me to wash his favorite Little Mermaid pajamas.\u00a0 He put them on and then sprayed some of my Victoria\u2019s Secret Body Mist on himself.\u00a0 He.\u00a0 Was.\u00a0 Ready. Then, we got to school and he didn\u2019t want to get out of the car. \u201cWhat if somebody sees me?\u201d he asked in worry. \u201cThey\u2019ll see your fabulous Little Mermaid pajamas,\u201d I said.\u00a0 \u201cIf you want to change, I have a pair of your brother\u2019s old pajamas that you can wear instead.\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d He sat quietly looking out of the window for a minute or two.\u00a0 I could tell he was gathering his courage.\u00a0 His little chest took a deep breath and he opened the car door.\u00a0 He had made his own decision and I walked behind him to class.\u00a0 I had his back every step of the way. We got some looks, I\u2019m not gonna lie.\u00a0 But, I\u2019m getting pretty oblivious to them. Then his girl friend Isabella walked up to him. \u201cC.J., you look soooooo pretty in your Little Mermaid pajamas,\u201d she said with admiration and a smile. \u201cThank you,\u201d C.J. said shyly.\u00a0 It was the highlight of his day. Ms. Sensible took the pajama\u2019d kids into her classroom and sat them down.\u00a0 She explained that it was pajama day and everybody was wearing what they were comfortable in, that people are comfortable in different kinds of pajamas and that\u2019s okay.\u00a0 She reminded them that teasing was not okay on pajama day or any other day. As far as C.J. is concerned, pajama day was the best day of the school year and it set the stage for him to wear a hula girl outfit to the Hawaiian-themed pre-k graduation four days later.
