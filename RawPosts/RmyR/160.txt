All Posts Awkward Book Release Preorder Raising My Rainbow Raising My Rainbow Book Random House 
 This is the awkward post that I knew I’d have to publish one day.  The day is here. My book, Raising My Rainbow, goes on sale in exactly two weeks.   So, here I am officially asking you to please buy my book.  Not just buy it, but preorder it. Why?  Because preorders increase the chance that the book will make it onto local and national bestseller lists, which will help immensely in (hopefully) inspiring a conversation that raises awareness of, understanding about and acceptance for gender creative kids. I am the kind of person who hates asking for help.  If I can find a way to do something myself and not bother anybody else, I always will.  I can’t do this by myself. I never thought that I’d be an author or advocate, but here I am – thanks to you all – and I fully intend to use this book to do whatever I can for the greater good of kids like my sweet and sparkly C.J. We appreciate your help “for real-sies,” as C.J. would say.  Here are the preorder buttons.  Thank you times infinity and with total sincerity. Pre-order the Raising My Rainbow book!
