My book, Raising My Rainbow, goes on sale in exactly two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0 So, here I am officially asking you to please buy my book.\u00a0 Not just buy it, but preorder it. Why?\u00a0 Because preorders increase the chance that the book will make it onto local and national bestseller lists, which will help immensely in (hopefully) inspiring a conversation that raises awareness of, understanding about and acceptance for gender creative kids. I am the kind of person who hates asking for help.\u00a0 If I can find a way to do something myself and not bother anybody else, I always will. \u00a0I can\u2019t do this by myself. I never thought that I\u2019d be an author or advocate, but here I am \u2013 thanks to you all \u2013 and I fully intend to use this book to do whatever I can for the greater good of kids like my sweet and sparkly C.J. We appreciate your help \u201cfor real-sies,\u201d as C.J. would say.\u00a0 Here are the preorder buttons.\u00a0 Thank you times infinity and with total sincerity. Pre-order the Raising My Rainbow book! \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Page 16 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
