My annual struggle always shows up right on time.\u00a0 Do I warn parents that my son will be presenting as a girl?\u00a0 Do I inform gift givers that he doesn\u2019t like \u201cboy toys?\u201d\u00a0 You\u2019d think I\u2019d have the answers by now.\u00a0 But, I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve talked with enough moms of gender creative kids to know that these are issues that most of us have stressed over and try to handle as delicately and directly as possible.\u00a0 I\u2019ve often wondered what\u2019s the best way to handle these birthday party dilemmas?  Then, C.J. received an invitation to his friend T.L.\u2019s Arabian Nights themed eighth birthday party. \u00a0T.L. is gender nonconforming too. When C.J. learned that he had mail, he hopped up and down trying to peek inside the mailbox.\u00a0 When he learned that it was an invitation to a party, he ripped the envelope and yanked out the invite.\u00a0 When he saw that the party invitation was decorated with colorful feathers and rhinestones he nearly lost his mind.\u00a0 He squealed, held the invitation tight to his heart, closed his eyes and smiled as he ran in place. When I finally pried the invite out of his hands to read for myself, it was my turn to be over-the-top happy.\u00a0 All because of this disclaimer that T.L.\u2019s Mom had included at the bottom.  \u00a0 A Quick Note to Our New Friends: For those of you who have not yet had the pleasure to really get to know our fabulous T.L., he likes things that might traditionally be considered just for girls.\u00a0 When shopping for a gift anything that you would normally get for an eight year old girl, T.L\u00a0 will love!\u00a0 Oh yeah, and if you\u2019re not comfortable with an eight year old boy in a dress\u2026you might want to sit this one out. \u00a0\ud83d\ude42  I immediately texted T.L.\u2019s mom to RSVP and tell her what a fierce mama she is.\u00a0 Later that night, when I showed the invite to C.J.\u2019s Dad he made me text T.L.\u2019s Mom again to let her know that he thinks that she\u2019s pretty rockin\u2019 awesome too. In houses around town I pictured T.L.\u2019s classmates getting the same invitation.\u00a0 I pictured other parents reading the disclaimer and having a range of emotions.\u00a0 I hope that some of them realized how brave T.L. and his Mom are.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy to see that they are fabulous. \u00a0Their bravery is less flashy but deserves the most credit.
