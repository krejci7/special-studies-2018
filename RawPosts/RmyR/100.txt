I waited nervously to see what C.J. would say. \u201cA lawyer,\u201d he replied. I smiled. My son was spinning the truth. I\u2019m in PR, I know good spin when I see it. Yes, in very general terms my son will be trick-or-treating as a lawyer for Halloween. More specifically, he will be dressed as Reese Witherspoon\u2019s lawyer character Elle Woods from the movie Legally Blonde. There are three very important reasons why C.J. selected this costume: 3. He likes the movie. 2. He likes to wear long blonde wigs. 1. The costume came with a pink purse with a tiny plush Chihuahua inside. (This is the main reason.) C.J.\u00a0took several liberties with the Elle Woods costume we bought at the costume store. (BTW, the costume was 75 percent off because not many size-seven, second graders want to dress up as a character from a movie made six years before they were born.) C.J. added two necklaces, leggings, gloves, a tiara and, on occasion, a feather boa. We need to pick up a new pair of comfy ballet flats tomorrow. Nothing like waiting until the last minute, I know. For the past four years, C.J. has worn a \u201cgirl\u2019s costume\u201d for Halloween. And, every year he has stressed out about telling certain people his costume choice. My son doesn\u2019t want to be teased for the things he likes, clothes he wears, hobbies he enjoys, books he reads and costumes he chooses. He wants to like what he likes without people hating his decisions. \u201cC.J., what are you going to be for Halloween?\u201d his teacher asked him last year in front of the entire class at the end of the day on Halloween. I was volunteering in class and cringed in my seat in the back of the room. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet\u2026\u201d he said part shy, part embarrassed, part annoyed. \u201cWhat?! You better decide! It\u2019s Halloween!\u201d she said. This is his \u201cserious attitude\u201d face, he says. (He gives me this look several times a day.) The other kids looked at him in disbelief. What kid doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to dress up as just hours before ringing that first doorbell and scoring that first candy? C.J. had decided\u2026.in July. He just didn\u2019t want tell his peers and deal with their reactions. We\u2019ve taught him that when it comes to his gender identity and expression, he doesn\u2019t owe people an explanation if he doesn\u2019t feel like giving one. He\u2019s empowered to protect himself when he feels like he needs or wants to. Evasion was his coping mechanism last year. This year he coped by giving one version of the truth, speaking in generalities and leaving out the details. He looked at me after telling his classmate he\u2019s going to be a lawyer and smiled. I smiled back at our little secret. I\u2019m sure everyone who thinks C.J. is going as a lawyer pictures him in a little suit and tie with a briefcase and, maybe, faux spectacles \u2013 not a pink velvet peplum skirt, white fishnet gloves, lap dog and crown. But, just as there are lots of versions of being a boy, there are lots of versions of being a lawyer. All of those who like C.J.\u2019s version of being a lawyer best say \u201cAye.\u201d Aye!
