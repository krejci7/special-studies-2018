Do you like it?\u201d I said. \u201cNo,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. I said nothing. I smiled as I looked around. My five year old was the only boy on the team who didn\u2019t know what sport he was playing. He can\u2019t be bothered to keep things like that straight. He can name every Disney princess and her movie of origin, specific shades of pink and purple, and the difference between a braid, a french braid, a ponytail\u00a0and pigtails. But, baseball and football have no defining characteristics that set each other apart in his brain. C.J. had tried baseball before. It didn\u2019t exactly go well, he didn\u2019t exactly like it, but that was nearly two years ago and we wanted him to give it another go. He shies away from athletics and we don\u2019t want him to. He\u2019s tried baseball, flag football, soccer, gymnastics and swimming. We want him to feel comfortable competing, being part of a team and being athletic. We asked him if he wanted to try baseball again. Yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes. No. Yes. No. No. Yes. Yes. We signed him up for the local recreation league and C.J. was picked to be on the Seattle Mariners. \u201cWhat\u2019s a mariner?\u201d he asked his dad. \u201cA seaman,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad said. I couldn\u2019t help but giggle. \u201cIt\u2019s like a sailor,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad said, giving my juvenile humor a dirty look. C.J. loved his shiny teal jersey and hat with an \u201cS\u201d on it. \u201cWhat team are you on?\u201d Nana Grab Bags asked C.J. \u201cThe Sailors,\u201d C.J. said. \u201cOh, how fun!\u201d Nana Grab Bags said, not knowing her professional baseball teams and fully trusting C.J. \u201cYou\u2019re not on the sailors, you\u2019re on the Mariners,\u201d I corrected C.J. \u201cThey are the same thing, Daddy told me. And, that\u2019s why there is an \u2018S\u2019 on my hat,\u201d C.J. argued. I pick my battles and this wasn\u2019t going to be one of them. C.J. was a sailor. The Seattle Sailors were comprised of\u00a0four and five year olds, all boys, most of them had little to no baseball experience. They met every Sunday for a 45 minute practice followed by a one inning game. On the way to the first practice/game, C.J. insisted that he didn\u2019t want to play baseball anymore. \u201cWell, you haven\u2019t even started yet, how do you know that you don\u2019t want to play?\u201d I asked. \u201cCause I know,\u201d he said looking out the window with arms tightly crossed against his chest. His pink and purple fingernails peeking out. \u201cYou only have to do it six times, then you don\u2019t have to do it again if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d I reasoned. \u201cOkay.\u201d About half of the kids on the team had a dad by their side throughout the practice and the game. C.J.\u2019s Dad was there every step of the way, coaching C.J. and reminding him that he would get a snow cone from the snack bar after the game if he tried his hardest. The Sailors were up first. The league supplied four batting helmets: two black, one navy blue and one pink. The boys in the dugout avoided the pink helmet like it had the plague, or worse \u2014 the cooties. Not C.J. As his turn to bat neared he proudly put on the pink batting helmet. His dad was acting as first base coach and watched the scene unfold from a few feet away. None of the boys said anything to C.J. about his helmet choice. They were probably all glad that they wouldn\u2019t have to wear the pink helmet since it was on his head. C.J. was next up to bat and one of the other fathers walked up to him and started to remove the helmet. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wear a pink helmet buddy,\u201d he said as he pulled it off of C.J.\u2019s head. C.J.\u2019s Dad left his job at first base. \u201cActually, he wants to wear the pink helmet,\u201d he said to the other father. \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cOh, okay.\u201d C.J. skipped to home plate for his ups. He hit the ball and I watched as my boy in the pink helmet ran straight to third base while his dad yelled to him from first base. C.J.\u2019s Brother laughed uncontrollably. After every player on our team had a chance to hit the ball and run the bases, it was time to play the field. C.J. was shortstop with his dad by his side. I could see it; C.J. started to get bored. Halfway through the other teams\u2019 ups, I watched as C.J. dropped his baseball mitt to the ground and took off his hat with the \u201cS\u201d on it and threw it to the ground. He casually walked off of the field. C.J.\u2019s Dad didn\u2019t notice that he\u2019d been ditched until C.J. had reached the dugout, where he promptly began collecting his things. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked C.J. when I got to the dugout. \u201cI\u2019m all done. I only like baseball when I\u2019m hitting the ball,\u201d he said informatively. \u201cThat\u2019s how everybody feels, but you gotta go out there and catch the ball and try to get the other team out,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad said. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d C.J. said, now sitting on the dugout bench and swinging his feet. The inning was over, marking the end of the game. \u201cDo I get a snow cone?\u201d C.J. asked. \u201cDid you try your hardest?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. No snow cone.\u201d The five following games went much, much better and C.J. was super-excited when he got a participation trophy after the last game. \u201cCan I have a trophy with a girl baseball player on top instead?\u201d he asked pointing to the gold male on the top of the trophy he had been given. \u201cNo, baby, you don\u2019t get to pick. If there are more boys than girls on your team, then the whole team gets a boy trophy. If there are more girls than boys on your team, then the whole team gets a girl trophy,\u201d I said, kind of making up my own rules. \u201cI want to play on a girls\u2019 team next time, then,\u201d C.J. said. \u201cOh, so you want to play baseball again?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo, never mind. I don\u2019t want to play baseball ever again, but if I did, I\u2019d want to be on a girls\u2019 team, not the Sailors.\u201d   ", "feedtitle": "Page 23 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
