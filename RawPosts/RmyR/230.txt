If you are confused and can\u2019t quite tell if I\u2019m a boy or a girl, just know that I am a person, please treat me that way.   Sometimes I notice that my gender nonconformity makes you uncomfortable.\u00a0 I\u2019m not trying to make you uncomfortable; I\u2019m trying to make myself comfortable.   My gender nonconformity is a way of expressing myself.\u00a0 A way of being true to myself, true to the way my heart beats and my blood flows.\u00a0 I allow you to express your gender your way without being bothered; I hope that you will allow me to do the same.   It\u2019s silly when you think, say or feel that colors, clothes and/or toys are \u201conly for girls\u201d or \u201conly for boys.\u201d Colors, toys and clothes are for everybody \u2014 even though one particular item may be marketed only to one sex or gender.\u00a0 Antiquated notions like dolls are only for girls have no reason to exist and I see them as pure nonsense.   Just because I\u2019m gender nonconforming doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019ll grow up to be LGBTQ.\u00a0 It\u2019s a strong predictor, but I\u2019d rather you see me as a child and not an underage punch line to some homophobic\u00a0 joke. That makes you gross.   It hurts my feelings when people point and laugh at because of my gender nonconformity.\u00a0 I\u2019m not weird, I\u2019m just different.\u00a0 I don\u2019t need people pointing out my differences \u2014 especially people who are old enough to know better.   I don\u2019t ask that you teach everyone around me about sex and gender and sexuality, but if you could teach them about empathy I would greatly appreciate it.\u00a0 Treat others how you want to be treated, it\u2019s that simple.   I don\u2019t fit into a category or a box. I may not be easy to explain or understand, but if you approach me with an open heart and an open mind, I can guarantee that I will change your way of thinking.\u00a0 It makes me sad when I learn that your mind and heart are closed.   Kids like me are the most likely to suffer from depression, addiction and bullying, practice unsafe sex and commit suicide.\u00a0 Please refrain from making me hate myself because I am different.\u00a0 My gender nonconformity should not be a thing of shame.   Bullies aren\u2019t just at school, sometimes they are at home too. Home should be the place where I feel the most safe and the most loved.\u00a0 If that is not the case.\u00a0 Something is wrong and I need help.   If you see me doing something that defies \u201ctraditional gender norms,\u201d don\u2019t place blame on my parents or family.\u00a0 Give them praise!\u00a0 It means that they are awesome enough to understand that I need their love and support more than anything. Them forcing me to express a gender that I don\u2019t exactly associate with or trying to \u201cfix\u201d me would do dangerous things to me. I don\u2019t need them to tell me to \u201cact like a lady\u201d or \u201cman up.\u201d\u00a0 I need them to tell me that I was perfectly created.\u00a0 If everybody in the world were the same or \u201cexpected\u201d this would be a very boring world.\u00a0 People like me give the world color.  * * * If you have something to add to the list, feel free to leave a comment below. \u00a0\ud83d\ude42   ", "feedtitle": "Page 23 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
