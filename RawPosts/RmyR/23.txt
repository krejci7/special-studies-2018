The server approaches our table with piping hot entrees and starts placing them in front of us. \u201cAnd, here are her chicken strips,\u201d she says as she places a basket of food in front of C.J. \u201cThank you.\u201d That\u2019s our reply when our son is misgendered, when someone assumes he\u2019s a she. We ignore it. It happens nearly once a day. It happens when he\u2019s dressed masculine and it happens when he\u2019s dressed feminine. It happens when his hair is a sweaty, knotty mess after two hours of gymnastics and it happens when his hair is clean and in a neat French braid. It happens when his fingernails are painted and it happens when their not. We have a rule that we don\u2019t correct people when they misgender C.J. It\u2019s not our rule actually. It\u2019s his. We just follow it. We use the male pronouns that he prefers, but if somebody else doesn\u2019t, he doesn\u2019t want us to correct them or even acknowledge it. \u201cIf people think I\u2019m a lady, just let them,\u201d he says. (By the way, before he turned ten he\u2019d say, \u201cIf people think I\u2019m a girl, just let them.\u201d\u00a0Obviously, in C.J.\u2019s mind, when you enter the double digits you go from girl to lady.) \u201cIf strangers think I\u2019m a lady it doesn\u2019t matter because I\u2019m never going to see them again. So who cares what they think,\u201d he explains. We\u2019re cool with that. It\u2019s his choice. And, knowing that his choice can change, we\u2019ve checked in with him often during the last six years. At age four, he didn\u2019t want us to correct people because he liked being mistaken for a girl. That\u2019s when he wanted to be a girl, so when people mistook him for one he would beam proudly knowing that he had convinced someone of something successfully. It\u2019s like the feeling I get when people think I have my shit together and am good at adulting. We all feel proud when people see us the way in which we want to be seen. We didn\u2019t correct people. In first and second grade he wanted us to correct people when they misgendered him. He no longer liked being mistaken for girl. Sure, he sometimes still wanted to be a girl, but more than anything he wanted to be his rainbow self. Why couldn\u2019t people understand that he was a boy who was a girl at heart? It was frustrating for him. We corrected people. Starting last year, he asked us not to correct people when they misgendered him because of the whole \u201cif they are strangers, I\u2019ll never see them again anyway\u201d reasoning and because he felt that correcting people drew more attention to the fact that he\u2019s different. We stopped correcting people. It was a hard habit for Chase to break. He\u2019s a protective older brother and wanted people to know when they had erroneously referred to his brother as his sister. Plus, if his brother wanted male pronouns, he should get them. A server approached our table to take our drink order and referred to C.J. using female pronouns. Chase corrected the server. \u201cBabe, don\u2019t do that, he doesn\u2019t like it,\u201d I said once the server was out of earshot. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t like it when people think he\u2019s a girl when clearly he\u2019s a boy,\u201d Chase argued. (Disclaimer: C.J. does not always \u201cclearly\u201d look like a boy.) \u201cBut, it\u2019s my choice and I don\u2019t want you to make a big deal out of it! You\u2019re embarrassing me!\u201d C.J. said folding his arms across his chest. \u201cI\u2019m not embarrassing you! I\u2019m standing up for you!\u201d Chase insisted while pulling his baseball hat down to block us from his view. And, that, my friends, is how something as simple and mundane as asking for a Diet Coke, lemonade and Arnold Palmer at a restaurant can turn into an emotional debacle when a person is misgendered and it isn\u2019t handled the way they want it to be. It\u2019s not about C.J. being misgendered; it\u2019s about how we react to it. We can\u2019t control the first, but we can control the latter \u2013 under his ever-changing direction.
