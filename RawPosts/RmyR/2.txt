Click here for all of the months\u2019 pictures, thoughts and happenings.  Let\u2019s face it. I\u2019ll never be as cool as this kid. \u00a0 Just some logo-inspired art CJ did for our friends\u00a0HRC\u00a0to thank them for their help and support during the James Woods Debacle of 2017. \u00a0 \u201cI like wearing this hat because, number one, it has llamas on it. And, number two is the best of all, I feel like I have long braids hanging down.\u201d \u2014 CJ, age 10 \u00a0 \u201cMy heart is beating so fast! I\u2019m so excited!,\u201d CJ squealed as we drove to\u00a0Ulta Beauty to spend the $50 gift card Uncle Michael gave him for Christmas. He says he\u2019s going to spend the rest of the day doing makeup and using his new straightening iron. Who\u2019s coming over for a free makeover? He wants to order in Thai food and I\u2019ll supply the wine. \u00a0 My glam squad is getting me ready for the Golden Globes. My look is unicorn inspired with a touch of mermaid and a dash of sparkle. UPDATE: This look apparently requires several types of highlighter liberally applied. Over and over again. \u00a0 When I was about CJ\u2019s age I was obsessed with The Babysitter\u2019s Club series. Ob-sessed. I was such a freaking Kristy, but longed to be artistic and exotic like Claudia. And urban and mature like Stacey. Seeing CJ reading this book makes my heart smile. \u201cThe kids at school are going to say it\u2019s a girls book and babysitting is for girls,\u201d he pointed out. We both just rolled our eyes and went back to our respective books. \u00a0 \u201cThis is great lighting. Take my picture. And I\u2019ll give you my \u2018what you\u2019re saying to me is bullshit face\u2019.\u201d \u2014 CJ, age 10 Maybe I should be discouraging his use of profanities. Maybe I should be discouraging having a \u201cI\u2019m not interested in your bullshit\u201d facial expression in his arsenal. But, the truth is, he\u2019s used that look a few times when it was necessary. When someone was saying something about his gender expression. And I was proud. CJ will be 11 this week. His confidence is growing. He\u2019s sure of who he is. He\u2019s a wonder. \u00a0\u00a0Friends who try out new slime recipes together, stay together. CJ met this new friend only a few months ago, but the connection was instant. They like to jump on the trampoline, swim, craft and create. They giggle nonstop. Seriously. Nonstop. When they grow up they are going to be interior designers and go into business together. The best part? We love the friend\u2019s entire family. How refreshing is it when you find your people? \u00a0 Can I get an \u201camen\u201d up in here? \u00a0   ", "feedtitle": "Raising My Rainbow"}
