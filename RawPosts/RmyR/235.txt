C.J. had just been upstairs playing dress up while I was putting laundry away. Earlier in the day he had been wearing his \u201cSomeday They\u2019ll Make a Movie About Me\u201d shirt from Old Navy and swim trunks.\u00a0 Now, he was wearing a pink t-shirt dress with hearts on it and a Monster High barrette in his hair. \u201cHoney Badger don\u2019t care!\u201d I said to C.J.\u2019s Dad.\u00a0 It\u2019s what we say to each other when we really mean that somebody doesn\u2019t give an eff about something. \u201cPeople are going to think that he\u2019s in trouble,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad said. \u201cYeah, people are going to see him dressed like a girl and that\u2019s the first thought that will come to mind,\u201d I said in sarcasm and continued outside to mount my scooter.\u00a0 I secretly love riding a Razor scooter; it makes me feel like such an extreme athlete. We used to prefer that C.J. not go out of the house if he was wearing an article of girls\u2019 clothing. We\u2019d gently steer him towards indoor play or have him put on something more appropriate for \u201csafety reasons.\u201d We did so to save all of us from ridicule and judgment. I\u2019ve also always had this weird belief that if a sexual predator were to be roaming our streets, a little boy dressed as a little girl would tickle his fancy like no other, making our son the prime target for pedophiles.\u00a0 These are the assumptions that I develop in my head that make perfect sense to me.\u00a0 I assume that if a pedophile can score a seemingly confused gender nonconforming kid, they have some sort of bragging rights amongst their like-minded friends.\u00a0 These, of course, are all just assumptions.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never associated with pedophiles, so I\u2019ve never had anybody to either confirm or deny my allegations. We\u2019ve become more lenient, C.J. doesn\u2019t desire to wear frilly things out of the house as much as he used to and our neighbors are used to seeing a fiery red-headed boy flit about in unusual costumes, nappy wigs and bare feet with pink toenails. C.J.\u2019s had strapped on his red helmet and took off on his purple scooter.\u00a0 I was looking for the black scooter that I usually ride. \u201cI just remembered something!\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad exclaimed entering the garage from the house. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, moving bikes, balls and bubbles around in an attempt to locate my scooter. \u201cWhenever C.J. plays outside in girl clothes I\u2019ve always worried that people will think that he is in trouble.\u00a0 I know now why I feel that way.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, stopping my scooter search to listen to my husband. \u201cWhen I was a little I knew this kid named Ben.\u00a0 When he got in trouble or did something wrong or did bad at baseball practice, when he got home his dad would make him put on his sister\u2019s clothes and ride her bike up and down the neighborhood.\u201d \u201cAre you effing kidding me?!\u201d I said, making sure that C.J. was out of earshot. \u201cNo, one time in high school, Ben did something wrong and to punish him his dad made him put on his mom\u2019s bra and panties and sit in a lawn chair in their front lawn.\u201d \u201cWhy have you never told me this before?!\u201d I said in shock. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I never really thought about it, but when I\u2019ve seen C.J. playing out front in girl clothes I\u2019ve always associated it with him being in trouble and being punished.\u00a0 I assumed everybody was thinking that he did something wrong.\u201d \u201cOh, they are probably thinking lots of things, but not that!\u00a0 What did you say to Ben about his father\u2019s method of punishment?\u201d \u201cI told him that it was weird and that my parents didn\u2019t do that,\u201d C.J.\u2019s Dad said. \u201cWhat is wrong with people? That is so disturbing,\u201d I said locating the scooter, though now I didn\u2019t feel like riding it. What if people thought that C.J.\u2019s Dad and I were punishing C.J. by making him wear girl clothes outside of the house? I watched my son as he hopped off of his scooter, picked several daisies from our neighbor\u2019s yard and held them in his proud grip as he scooted to deliver them to me with a beaming smile on his popsicle-stained face.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t look like he was being punished. I Googled Ben later that evening to see what became of him.\u00a0 Ben is a professional athlete.\u00a0 If Ben messes up at sports now does his dad still make him put on girls clothes and parade around for all to see?\u00a0 I wonder.
