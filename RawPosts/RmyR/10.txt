That being the case, I have spent the last year telling C.J. that no Halloween ever in the history of Halloweens will compare to the one he had last year. He has experienced his best Halloween. The end. Period. Adieu. (photo creds: Bob The Drag Queen) Last year I told the internets and social meeds that he was going to be Bob The Drag Queen for Halloween and, voila, Bob The Drag Queen surprised C.J. by knocking on the door just before sunset on October 31 and trick-or-treating through the streets of West Hollywood while holding C.J.\u2019s hand. That\u2019s not real life. Whoever or whatever you dress up as for Halloween does not care enough about you to want to fly across the country and spend the holiday with you.\u00a0If so, I would have spent some of my Halloweens with Tina Turner, Gumby and Rainbow Brite. We have been very open and honest with C.J. Then, the season nine finale of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race concluded and C.J. turned to me and said \u201cthis year I\u2019m going to be Sasha Velour for Halloween and she\u2019ll come trick-or-treating with me. Even though Bob will always be my favorite queen.\u201d \u201cNo! Remember. You\u2019ve had your best Halloween. That\u2019s not going to happen. That\u2019s not real life,\u201d I said. \u201cI remember,\u201d he said sadly. Oh, he remembered all right. He just didn\u2019t want to believe it. A few weeks ago he finally realized there was validity to what I had been saying all year. God bless the hopefulness of youth. He announced that he was going to be a dead drag queen for Halloween.  \u201cHow did she die?\u201d I asked not expecting an answer. \u201cWell. (click of the tongue and eye roll) Gurl. (flick of the wrist) She was headlining at a BIG drag show and one of the other drag queens didn\u2019t show up for her shift. (disgusted eye roll) So she had to work overtime and do extra numbers. When she got done with her show it was so late that she was too tired to drive her car home. And she didn\u2019t want to take a taxi or uber. So she decided to walk home. She was crossing the street when \u2014 BAM! \u2014 she got run over by a car!\u201d \u201cSo what I hear you saying is you\u2019ve thought of a backstory,\u201d I said. \u201cDuh.\u201d After several attempts to find just the right dress he decided to wear one he got last Christmas.\u00a0Then, he insisted that Matt run it over with our car. His costume and backstory require that we get him completely done up and gorgeous in drag. And then make it look like he was run over.\u00a0It\u2019s a multi-step, multi-layer process. Because why wouldn\u2019t it be? I mean, as much as I try to manage expectations and set the bar at a realistic height, it is C.J. we are talking about. We did a dry run in preparation for Halloween. Here are some pics. Boo!      ", "feedtitle": "Raising My Rainbow"}
