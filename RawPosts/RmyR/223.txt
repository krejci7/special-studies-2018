I don\u2019t know you and I won\u2019t know you until after Labor Day, but I just wanted to take a minute to introduce myself and my son to you.\u00a0 I\u2019m C.J.\u2019s Mom and my son C.J. is gender nonconforming.\u00a0 I used to shy away from telling people that before they got a chance to meet my awesome child, but, over the years I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s better to tell some people right up front \u2014 especially his teachers.\u00a0 Plus, he has told me that he prefers for me to make the announcement ahead of him.\u00a0 So, there you have it. C.J. drew himself as a kindergartner. Please don\u2019t think that I\u2019m crazy or that my son is crazy or that we are weird.\u00a0 It\u2019s okay to think that we are different.\u00a0 We are different, we own that and hope that people will see us being different and come to realize that our version of different is not scary or bad, but good and lovable. Anyway, as C.J. explains it, he is a boy who only likes girl stuff and sometimes likes to be treated like a girl.\u00a0 He will show up to school dressed in boy clothes, albeit usually pink and purple \u201cboy clothes\u201d that I get on the sale rack because very few boys seem to want the pink polo shirts, purple t-shirts and magenta skinny jeans that retailers take a gamble on.\u00a0 He likes to wear girl socks and safely tucks them inside of his shoes.\u00a0 They peek out.\u00a0 You\u2019ll see. Sometimes he accessorizes with beaded jewelry of his own creation or that he has chosen with the utmost care out of his Rapunzel jewelry box.\u00a0 I\u2019ve informed him that I\u2019d rather he not wear his clip on earrings to school because he might lose them and would be heartbroken.\u00a0 His lunch box is decorated with Monster High characters and has been his most prized possession since he got it at Target three weeks ago. I tell you all of these details so that you know what to expect on that first day of school.\u00a0 And also so that you will hopefully see how much thought goes into his getting ready each morning.\u00a0 Every morning he asks \u201cAre the kids going to tease me today?\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s asked me that question every sunrise for more than year and it breaks my heart that he has to worry about getting teased and because, every morning, I don\u2019t have an honest answer.\u00a0 All I can say is \u201cI don\u2019t know, baby.\u00a0 I hope not.\u201d My sweet son isn\u2019t trying to make anybody uncomfortable; he\u2019s trying to make himself comfortable, in a body and soul that don\u2019t always feel in alignment.\u00a0 Imagine that feeling. C.J. on a swing at the kindergarten playground. I\u2019m sure I seem incredibly high maintenance, but please know that I\u2019m never aiming to make your life more difficult, I\u2019m trying to make my son\u2019s life less difficult. \u00a0We don\u2019t want to be seen as a liability. \u00a0In our eyes it\u2019s not our family against you and the school and the district. \u00a0It\u2019s you and us against the world.\u00a0 We are on the same team. Those 20+ other little five- and six-year-old team members in your class?\u00a0 I\u2019m not asking you to educate them on gender or sex or the difference between the two.\u00a0 However, I do think that you have a responsibility to teach them about empathy, kindness and acceptance. If you have any questions about gender nonconforming kids, please ask.\u00a0 I love, love, love to share what I know with others, especially those who are in my son\u2019s life.\u00a0 So, talk to me, ask me questions, tell me your concerns, let\u2019s figure this our together. In the meantime, expect my son to draw himself as a girl, get his pronouns mixed up, have a hard time deciding which bathroom to use, always choose pink if it\u2019s an option and become uncomfortable if you divide the class by boys and girls.\u00a0 He\u2019ll do all of those things one day\u2026and then he may not do them next.\u00a0 His gender fluidity is just that: fluid. Finally, please don\u2019t gossip about us. If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me what the other moms at school think about us I could start a private school for kids like C.J.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care what the other parents think about us and I don\u2019t have time for gossip, so please, respect our privacy. Anyway, we\u2019re hopeful for the school year that is about to begin and can\u2019t wait to see our son transform into a kindergartner. All our best, always, C.J.\u2019s Mom (and C.J. and C.J.\u2019s Dad)   ", "feedtitle": "Page 23 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
