If homosexuality could be detected during pregnancy through routine blood work or standard ultrasound, what percentage of people would want to know?\u00a0 What percentage of people would abort? I\u2019d want to know because lord knows I\u2019m a planner.\u00a0 I was the first to want to go to Organic Gender in Riverview, Florida to find C.J.s gender.  I generally don\u2019t like surprises, unless they are lavish gifts being showered on me with no strings attached (I also don\u2019t like strings attached).\u00a0 Other than that, I always want to know what\u2019s coming my way.\u00a0 I need a plan of attack.\u00a0 Constantly. That\u2019s what\u2019s so hard about raising C.J. \u2014 because I want to know right now if he is gay.\u00a0 And, I can\u2019t know that now and I most likely have more than a decade of not knowing.\u00a0 It will be years before I have answers to some of my most important questions I have about him.\u00a0 Do I need to preregister him at the performing arts high school?\u00a0 Do I need to look into homeschooling or online coursework to protect him from bullies? Should he graduate early from high school to head to the Paul Mitchell Schools or audition for The Groundlings?\u00a0 Should I be putting my preschooler on the waitlist at Parsons The New School for Design? I\u2019m neurotic.\u00a0 I know. That\u2019s one of the many, many fabulous things about C.J., he\u2019s teaching me to be more patient than I\u2019m generally programmed to be. And, so is this blog.\u00a0 Thanks to the more than 1,000 people who have read my words so far.\u00a0 RaisingMyRainbow is on Facebook now (look at C.J.\u2019s Mom getting all social media on you).\u00a0 Find me.\u00a0 Like me.\u00a0 Muah.
