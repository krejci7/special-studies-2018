For C.J.\u2019s birthday, Prince Charming sent him this autographed picture\u2026  C.J. saw it pop up on the computer screen as I did. \u201cWho dat fo\u2019!\u201d he yelled, as if I wasn\u2019t sitting with my ear six inches from his perfect little\u00a0mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u00a0 Prince Charming sent it via e-mail from his castle,\u201d I answered, my voice overflowing with splendor and awe. \u201cGive it to me!\u201d he said as he reached across me in a mad attempt to rip it from the screen. I printed it out on a piece of photo paper and C.J. twirled with it, held it up high, twirled again and hugged it close to his chest.\u00a0 Then it was nap time.\u00a0 And, he took Prince Charming.\u00a0 Then it was dinner time.\u00a0 And, he took Prince Charming.\u00a0 Then it was time to jump on the trampoline.\u00a0 And, he took Prince Charming.\u00a0 Then it was bath time.\u00a0 And, we fought over taking Prince Charming in the tub as I tried to explain why photos and water don\u2019t mix. Then, it was bedtime.\u00a0 And, he took Prince Charming. Two weeks later and he still loves his autographed Prince Charming photo (even though the neighbor boys weren\u2019t as impressed with it as he was). It\u2019s one of his most prized possessions and it was a very thoughtful gesture from our new friend Mitch.\u00a0 C.J. and I are thankful for all of the people who follow our adventures, especially the nice ones. * * * This week Raising My Rainbow welcomed readers from Spain!\u00a0 Hola!\u00a0 Thank you to dosmanzanas.com! \u00a0Raising My Rainbow has now made it to Canada, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand and Spain.
