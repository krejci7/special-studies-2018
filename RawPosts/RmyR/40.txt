My nine-year-old son C.J. is no different from most boys. He\u2019ll dress up as his hero for Halloween. His hero is Bob The Drag Queen. Bob The Drag Queen is the winner of the most recent season of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. Bob, RuPaul and all the queens are brave, strong heroes for my rainbow son. They\u2019ve taught him to celebrate his uniqueness, cultivate his own style and let criticisms roll off his back. They\u2019ve taught him the importance and power of loving himself. They\u2019ve also taught him a few words and phrases that I\u2019ve told him he can\u2019t use until he\u2019s 18. C.J. has watched Bob The Drag Queen\u2019s \u201cPurse First\u201d music video more times than I can count (his second favorite video to watch is Alaska\u2019s \u201cYour Makeup Is Terrible\u201d). So, naturally, he wanted to emulate Bob\u2019s \u201cPurse First\u201d video look for Halloween. The inspiring look. Bob The Drag Queen in \u201cPurse First.\u201d (Screenshot via YouTube.) \u201cJust so you know, we aren\u2019t going to make your skin or face brown like Bob The Drag Queen\u2019s,\u201d I established right up front. Bob is black and C.J. is half Irish with skin the color of fat free milk and red hair. While I\u2019m totally fine with my son going in drag, I\u2019m completely opposed to him going in blackface. To some people, that makes me weird. \u201cWhy would you think I\u2019d do that?\u201d C.J. asked in surprised disgust. Which made me proud of him and disappointed in myself for bringing it up. \u201cI need her dress and purse and hair and makeup and everything.\u201d Now, let\u2019s be clear. I\u2019m not a seamstress, nor a makeup artist. I\u2019ve never styled a wig, nor made a purse. I am a mom from the suburbs whose real talents are propagating succulents and whipping up dinner using random ingredients from the pantry because I\u2019m too lazy to go to the store. Knowing my limitations, C.J. told me to call his Uncle Michael for help. \u201cYou can\u2019t order this costume on online, mom! Call my FuGuncle (fun gay uncle)!\u201d I did as I was told because I knew it was the right thing to do. Days later Uncle Michael arrived from West Hollywood with a wig, fake eyelashesm pearls and big ideas. Thank RuPaul for gay brothers. Uncle Michael helped C.J. shop for supplies and make a purse to match the dress they had me order from Amazon. Then, Uncle Michael set up a classroom in our dining room and taught us how to style the wig and do the makeup, because he won\u2019t be in town to help on Halloween. I hope that when the big night finally gets here, my newly learned drag queen skills don\u2019t fail me.    (The one item left on my Halloween to-do list is to buy a petticoat for my son \u2013 which is something I never thought I\u2019d say.) C.J. has since perfected his 2016 trick-or-treating technique. He will approach a house. Ring the doorbell and stand to the side. When a person opens the door, he will come into view purse first. I don\u2019t have the heart to tell him that people in our conservative Orange County neighborhood probably won\u2019t get his shtick. \u201cWhat are you going to be for Halloween?\u201d people and peers have been asking C.J. for weeks. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he always says nonchalantly. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you telling people what you\u2019re going to be for Halloween?\u201d I asked him in private, worried that he wasn\u2019t telling people because he was afraid of being teased. \u201cI\u2019m not telling people that I\u2019m going to be Bob The Drag Queen for Halloween because I don\u2019t want them to steal my awesome idea,\u201d he replied with the attitude needed to be the world\u2019s best drag queen for a night.
