It was the day C.J. discovered Barbie. Back story: Uncle Uncle and I had a bad Barbie addiction as children. It was tough to shake, especially since our mother was and is a total enabler.\u00a0 In March 2009, Nana Grab Bags bought me \u2013 a grown woman \u2014 Mattel\u2019s 50th Anniversary Bathing Suit Barbie.\u00a0 She was a modernized version of the original 1959 doll with a two-piece, black and white bikini trimmed with her signature color pink, pink hoop earrings, ponytail and a cell phone.  \u00a0 \u00a0 The girl who changed C.J.\u2019s life forever. \u00a0 I kept her in her box in my closet for months.\u00a0 One fall day I was cleaning out my closet and sat boxed Barbie on my bed. \u201cWHAT DAT?!\u201d I nearly fell off my stepstool at C.J.\u2019s shriek. \u201cIt\u2019s Barbie.\u201d \u201cI want to open she!\u201d He held the box as he jumped up and down, up and down, up and down. I hesitated.\u00a0 You don\u2019t open a boxed Barbie if you can at all help it. But his face.\u00a0 His sweet excited face could convince me to do worse things.\u00a0 We opened her. Cue the choir of angels. I figured he would play with her for a day or two and lose interest; like he did with most toys.\u00a0 She\u2019s been a constant in his life for more than a year.\u00a0 Oh, he wasn\u2019t dabbling, he was hardcore from the start. It was the beginning of our adventures in raising a slightly effeminate, possibly gay, totally fabulous son.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Hair and makeup by C.J. Call for your appointment today! \u00a0 C.J.\u2019s Brother was a devoted Thomas the Tank Engine fan from his third birthday to his fourth birthday exactly.\u00a0 12 months; no more, no less. C.J. and Barbie are celebrating their 16 month anniversary. \u201cAnd, how\u2019s C.J.?\u00a0 Is he still playing with dolls?\u00a0 Oh, he is?\u00a0 When do you think this phase is going to end?\u00a0 What do you think it means?\u201d ask Grandma and Grandpa Colorado when we catch up by phone. Since C.J. hooked up with Barbie I\u2019ve been mostly answer-less. I have to admit, it\u2019s easier for me to connect with my younger son over Barbie than it was to connect with my older son over Thomas the Tank Engine and the Best Traxxas RC Trucks.\u00a0 Me and Babs\u00a0go way back.\u00a0 Playing Barbies\u00a0with C.J. is much like playing Barbies\u00a0with Uncle Uncle.\u00a0 Uncle Uncle\u00a0would backcomb her hair to high hell and I\u2019d be responsible for brushing her out; same goes for when C.J. manages to tangle her to rat\u2019s nest proportions.\u00a0 And, both Uncle Uncle and C.J. have scolded me countless times for my outfit choices and styling techniques.\u00a0 It\u2019s history repeating itself.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Uncle Uncle taught C.J. to fashion a waterproof cocktail dress out of a Ziploc bag. Perfect for nights in the hot tub or a dip in the rooftop pool at The London after dark. \u00a0 Since C.J. fell off the \u201cboy toy\u201d wagon we\u2019ve endured questioning stares, dirty looks, disgusted headshakes, knowing nods and smiles of encouragement. C.J. has been his happiest since he met Barbie, we haven\u2019t always been.\u00a0 But, as a mother, I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.   ", "feedtitle": "Page 33 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
