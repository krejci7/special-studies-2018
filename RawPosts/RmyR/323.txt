One of the favorites, by far, is the book The Boy Who Cried Fabulous written by Leslea Newman and illustrated by Peter Ferguson. C.J. is...The Boy Who Cried Fabulous. Yes, I have read My Princess Boy by Cheryl Kilodavis.\u00a0 I applaud her. But, C.J. identifies more with The Boy Who Cried Fabulous. \u00a0I think it has something to do with redheads sticking together; hence his affinity for Ariel (The Little Mermaid) and Strawberry Shortcake.\u00a0 I digress. The Boy Who Cried Fabulous is, in a word, fabulous. It\u2019s about Roger\u2026 \u201cRoger is \u2018different\u2019 much to his parents\u2019 dismay, until he teaches them just how fabulous being different can be!\u201d Leslea Newman explains why she wrote the book\u2026. \u201cI have a very good friend named Roger, whose favorite word is \u201cfabulous.\u201d One day Roger told me a friend of his gave him a nickname: the boy who cried fabulous. Roger said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be a great title for a children\u2019s book?\u201d I agreed and went to work!\u201d Excerpt \u2013 The Boy Who Cried Fabulous \u201cWhen Roger started out for school, His mother set a simple rule. She said, \u2018Now Roger, you go straight Straight to class and don\u2019t be late.\u2019 Roger tried hard to obey, He knew that he should not delay. He shouldn\u2019t wander or explore But then he came upon a store, Its windows full of lovely clothes So colorful that Roger froze, Then clapped his hands in fits of glee And shouted out in ecstasy: \u201cWhat a fabulous coat, is it silk or wool? What a fabulous bell, can I give it a pull? What a fabulous door, does it open wide? What a fabulous store, can I come inside?\u201d \u00a9 2003 Lesl\u00e9a Newman People often as me what C.J. looks like. He pretty much looks like a younger version of this. Handsome, no? \u00a0Other books by Leslea Newman that you might want to give a read\u2026. Mommy, Mama, and Me and Daddy, Papa, and Me are the first board books ever published for kids who live in two-mom and two-dad families. A Fire Engine for Ruthie about a little girl who wants to play with fire engines and trains and motorcycles. Too Far Away to Touch about a child and her special uncle who is lots of fun, even when living with AIDS means he\u2019s not feeling his best. Felicia\u2019s Favorite Story about a little girl who loves to hear the story of her adoption told by her two mothers. Heather Has Two Mommies about a little girl with two mommies who learns that families come in all shapes and sizes.
