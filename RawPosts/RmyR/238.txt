Dear Pastor Harris, Hi.\u00a0 I\u2019m C.J.\u2019s Mom and boy would you hate me!\u00a0 I have a little boy who likes \u201cfeminine\u201d things and I\u2019ve allowed him to do so.\u00a0 I\u2019ve even shared it with people on the internet.\u00a0 But, not by taking pictures and posting them on YouTube, as you suggest \u2014 mostly because that\u2019s not exactly how YouTube works, I think you have it confused with Facebook, but that\u2019s not really the point I\u2019m trying to get at anyway. My point is my son is gender variant.\u00a0 He\u2019s a little boy who likes all things girly, like playing with dolls and wearing skirts.\u00a0 My son started acting a little girlish at age two and a half and I didn\u2019t, as you suggest, \u201csquash that like a cockroach.\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s had childhood fantasies and I haven\u2019t squashed them.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Because here\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m a Christian.\u00a0 One who believes that God doesn\u2019t make mistakes.\u00a0 He made my son perfectly, by his own design.\u00a0 God knew every hair on his precious little head before he was even born.\u00a0 Before he started \u201cacting like a female.\u201d\u00a0 I figure that God knew what he was doing when he created C.J. and that I was given C.J. as my child to love him, not change him. My gay brother (yes, I have one of those in addition to my effeminate son!) and I grew up in a home where somewhere along the way religion became more about fear, rules and judgement than love, kindness and peace.\u00a0 Your words remind me of that home.\u00a0 When you say things like \u201cDads, when you see your little son dropping the limp wrist, you walk over there and crack that wrist\u201d it makes my heart feel like a scared child again.\u00a0 Aren\u2019t fathers supposed to model their behaviors after the ultimate father?\u00a0 Christ.\u00a0 Would Christ crack his child\u2019s wrist? I have to believe that Christ wouldn\u2019t tell one of his little boys to \u201cman up\u201d and then \u201cgive him a little punch.\u201d\u00a0 I haven\u2019t read the part of the bible where Christ punched people.\u00a0 Did I miss that part during my two years of theology courses in college? So anyway, thank you for giving my husband and me permission to crack our son\u2019s wrists, punch him and bully him in his own home.\u00a0 We have chosen, instead, to love our son just as God created him and to allow him the freedom to flourish and thrive using the gifts God gave to him specifically. Bless you, C.J.\u2019s Mom   ", "feedtitle": "Page 24 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
