One of Grandpa Colorado's favorite fishing spots. There is a truism in the statement \u201conce a parent, always a parent.\u201d\u00a0 If I am to look at the circumstances leading up to becoming a traditional parent, I find many things come into play.\u00a0 Find a partner.\u00a0 Marry her.\u00a0 When the time comes in which you both agree that you are ready for a child and you say \u201cit\u2019s time,\u201d be ready for life\u2019s little disappointments and surprises. Failure to conceive this month and then the next month.\u00a0 The false pregnancies, the painful miscarriages are devastating and take you to a corner in your mind with yourself.\u00a0 But you find there is a plan\u2026two months, then three, now you tell your parents and your friends as you enter four, now five and watch your wife\u2019s body change and you deal as best you can with her incredibility fascinating and weird situation.\u00a0 But always in the back of your mind as eight and now nine months approach you remember life\u2019s little disappointments and surprises.\u00a0 What if the baby is not healthy?\u00a0 What will we do? I have always tried to be a good father.\u00a0 There wasn\u2019t a manual handed to me when the unbelievable event occurred, so I decided to use my father as a sort of \u201creverse barometer.\u201d When parenting my sons, there would be no slapping in the face, no hitting on the buttocks or legs with a stick that they had to cut from a tree in the backyard.\u00a0 No shaking, no screaming, no slugging in the stomach and I would do my best not to have my sons fear me.\u00a0 These were simple rules and I tried my best to uphold them, like I said, there wasn\u2019t a manual. I watched both my boys grow and experience life.\u00a0 I was \u2014 and am still \u2014 proud of their academics, sports participation and social skills.\u00a0 Their standards in school might have been a little difficult for them at times because their school was where I earned my living.\u00a0 I taught for 33 years in secondary education and expected their studies and conduct toward teachers and coaches to be more than average at all times; a little pressure, I\u2019m sure, but it was in MY manual. The lake by Grandpa Colorado's house. As my children continued in their formal education they found their soul mates; beautiful young ladies who shared their values, their hopes and their dreams together.\u00a0 The marriages of my sons held such special anticipation.\u00a0 Grandchildren\u2026new boys, new girls, more family, we could hardly wait.\u00a0 My wife and I have been blessed with grandchildren who get older and wiser each year and we are parents of parents.\u00a0 Life is good. There are times in which I am jealous and it doesn\u2019t speak well of my character, but I strongly feel that if we never feel jealousy we can never experience love.\u00a0 Nevertheless, I am jealous of the relationship my son and his wife (C.J.\u2019s Mom and Dad) have with their children.\u00a0 They are better parents than I ever was, way better.\u00a0 They guide and allow, a concept that I never invoked.\u00a0 Mine was control and approve.\u00a0 The love and respect and the fun that their children have for them gives me pause.\u00a0 Is there some way I can go back? In my experience as a teacher and managing a class I tried to be aware of behaviors and be willing to correct inappropriate actions from some students directed toward others.\u00a0 I hate bullies.\u00a0 Long before I became 6\u2019 4\u201d and 240 pounds I was bullied by individuals in grade school and couldn\u2019t get away from them.\u00a0 No complaint to a teacher brought me relief, it is still with me today at age 65\u2026 this time, I\u2019m glad I can\u2019t go back, I would be afraid of my actions. Grandpa Colorado's new puppy. In my classroom my method was simple.\u00a0 When \u201cjocks\u201d or the socially \u201ccool\u201d or the wannabe \u201cthugs\u201d started to get the upper hand on some individual that targeted individual was sent to a counselor who, by prearrangement, kept him/her in the office for ten minutes \u201cjust checking their schedule\u201d while I talked to my class and reminded them of life\u2019s little disappointments.\u00a0 Their future child might not look right, maybe not talk or walk right, or just not fit in. \u201cWorse still, your future child could be on the playground or in the classroom with bullies like YOU!\u00a0 How dare you!\u201d I\u2019d say to my class.\u00a0 In the past, leaders and followers have come to me and apologized for their behavior and have brought the victim into their circle. Toward the end of my teaching career, I was seeing many examples of this bullying social behavior.\u00a0 I saw more and more children taunted by their \u201cfriends;\u201d bullied by individuals that morphed into groups; excluded from athletic groups, social groups and academic groups just because of that groups\u2019 perception of what was correct, cool and normal. Friedrich Nietzsche the German philosopher once commented that humans are the only animal that commits suicide.\u00a0 It is chilling, but it is true.\u00a0 Our young children listen at times to the wrong people with tragic consequences.\u00a0 Their panic and sense of self worth at times pushes them to a place that is hard to imagine.\u00a0 It breaks my heart that I find myself at times powerless to undo what some people have done.\u00a0 I am saddened in my character in that I am now not recognizing the better angels in peoples\u2019 souls but, instead, look for the evil in mankind instead of the good. My panic and fear is that I can\u2019t be that teacher or the parent for my grandchildren, but it is tempered by the love and support that is extended by their true parents.\u00a0 We as a society have allowed this community of bullies and evil to flourish and we as a society have the power to stop it through education and voice.
