My mother didn\u2019t want me to wear her dress either.\u00a0 Thankfully.\u00a0 Under the watchful eye of my brother and his then-boyfriend, I selected my wedding dress and promised myself that I would not keep it for the daughter that I might have.\u00a0 No way.\u00a0 No how. But, after the wedding and honeymoon were over I didn\u2019t have the heart to trash my dress.\u00a0 And, I couldn\u2019t bear to donate it either.\u00a0 I also didn\u2019t want to pay the $200 fee to have it dry-cleaned and professionally preserved.\u00a0 So I put it in big plastic storage bin and put it in the garage. \u00a0I\u2019d deal with it later. Then I got pregnant and the thought crossed my mind that we might have a girl and she might want to at least see and try on my dress.\u00a0 I decided to keep it awhile longer.\u00a0 We had a boy.\u00a0 Then I got pregnant again.\u00a0 It might be a girl.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t.\u00a0 There was officially no need for me to keep my wedding dress. Two years ago we had a neighborhood garage sale and I half-heartedly hung it out for the highest bidder.\u00a0 Nobody wanted it \u2014 which made me kind of sad.\u00a0 But, then again, I didn\u2019t really want it either.\u00a0 I thought about selling it on eBay or Craigslist, but that seemed like such a process. \u00a0If you know me, you know that I hate a process. \u00a0We had another garage sale a year later.\u00a0 Still, nobody wanted my dress.\u00a0 It continues to sit \u2014 ripped and dirty \u2014 in the big plastic bin in the farthest corner of our garage waiting for me to decide what to do with it. \u201cSooooo\u2026can I have it?\u00a0 Please say yes, please say yes,\u201d C.J. asked again, bouncing up and down. My heart and brain skipped a beat.\u00a0 Somebody wanted my wedding dress! \u201cYes.\u00a0 You can.\u201d \u201cCan I have it right now?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo, but when you are a little bit older, you can have it.\u00a0 I promise.\u201d \u201cYay!!!!\u201d\u00a0 He skipped out of the room. I pictured my son trying on my wedding dress in the years to come.\u00a0 I\u2019d surprise him and show him my tiara and veil as well.\u00a0 He would look beautiful in it.\u00a0 More importantly, he would feel beautiful in it.\u00a0 I pictured him, sometime later, deconstructing the dress and making an entirely new garment or two out of it.\u00a0 I smiled a big smile at the thought. My son wants my wedding dress and he can do anything he wants with it.\u00a0 Wear it, cut it, rip it, whatever.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad that I didn\u2019t purge the dress before I had kids.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad that I resisted the urge once I had only boys.\u00a0 Because my boy loves fashion, lace, beading and all things princess-like.\u00a0 And, he wants my dress and he\u2019s going to love it.
