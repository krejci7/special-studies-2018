The ability to select different characters, clothing, and props on each page means kids can customize the book to match their own life experiences. In doing so, the message feels more personal to each and every child allowing them to identify closely with certain instances where they may have felt \u2018different.\u2019\u201d \u00a0Download the app here:\u00a0\u00a0(https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/id521512463). * * * People in the Spokane area of Washington, listen up!\u00a0 I\u2019ve been contacted by a licensed mental health counselor and a mother of a seven-year-old transgender child.\u00a0 They have formed a playgroup open to all gender nonconforming and transgender children up to the age of 13. It provides children with a supportive and positive space where they can socialize with other children expressing comparable ranges of gender fluidity. \u00a0It is designed to run concurrently with the parents\u2019 group and conveniently allows parents the opportunity to meet while their children are having supervised fun in the same building. \u00a0Both groups are supervised by licensed mental health therapists and the playgroup has young adult mentors who identify along the gender spectrum. There is no charge for either group.
