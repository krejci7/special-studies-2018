If you haven\u2019t read it yet, check it out: \u201cBoys Will Be Boys? Not in These Families\u201d Share it via The New York Times site and/or leave a comment to support the writer and to let people know that this is an important issue that we want and need to read more about. Oh, and look for the Raising My Rainbow mention. Muah, Jan! We heart you! A question for you\u2026 This week I received a comment on one of my older posts titled \u201cTeeth Cleaning and Tiaras.\u201d The post was about C.J.\u2019s trip to the dentist and the tiara that he selected out of the treasure chest post-visit for being a super-duper patient (which, at the age of four, means that he didn\u2019t bite anybody when they put their hands in or around his mouth). Anyway, Raising My Rainbow reader Dannie wrote: \u201cencouraging? or allowing? what is the difference? What do you think of the comment? Is Dannie implying that my allowing C.J.\u2019s gender nonconforming behaviors is okay, but encouraging them and him is excessive and not advisable? That\u2019s what I take from the comment. Which made me think. My final thought? If you can turn encouraging a child into a bad thing, something is wrong with you, not me.\u00a0 What do you say? C.J.: \"Daddy, can I make your shirt pretty?\" C.J.'s Dad: \"Sure\" Love the glitter foam stickers. The best part? C.J.'s Dad forgot they were back there and wore the shirt all day. Thanks for all of the comments you\u2019ve been posted. C.J\u2019s Dad and I read every single one, repeatedly. Know that! We\u2019re thankful for every single one, even those like the one above. And, finally\u2026. Happy Father\u2019s Day to C.J.\u2019s Dad, a man who was born to be father and the best husband ever. And, Happy Father\u2019s Day to you too.
