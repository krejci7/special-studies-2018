 Cheers to ah-mazing New York Times reporter Jan Hoffman for her recent article on parenting gender nonconforming kids. If you haven’t read it yet, check it out: “Boys Will Be Boys? Not in These Families” Share it via The New York Times site and/or leave a comment to support the writer and to let people know that this is an important issue that we want and need to read more about. Oh, and look for the Raising My Rainbow mention. Muah, Jan! We heart you! A question for you… This week I received a comment on one of my older posts titled “Teeth Cleaning and Tiaras.” The post was about C.J.’s trip to the dentist and the tiara that he selected out of the treasure chest post-visit for being a super-duper patient (which, at the age of four, means that he didn’t bite anybody when they put their hands in or around his mouth). Anyway, Raising My Rainbow reader Dannie wrote: “encouraging? or allowing? what is the difference? What do you think of the comment? Is Dannie implying that my allowing C.J.’s gender nonconforming behaviors is okay, but encouraging them and him is excessive and not advisable? That’s what I take from the comment. Which made me think. My final thought? If you can turn encouraging a child into a bad thing, something is wrong with you, not me.  What do you say? C.J.: "Daddy, can I make your shirt pretty?" C.J.'s Dad: "Sure" Love the glitter foam stickers. The best part? C.J.'s Dad forgot they were back there and wore the shirt all day. Thanks for all of the comments you’ve been posted. C.J’s Dad and I read every single one, repeatedly. Know that! We’re thankful for every single one, even those like the one above. And, finally…. Happy Father’s Day to C.J.’s Dad, a man who was born to be father and the best husband ever. And, Happy Father’s Day to you too.
