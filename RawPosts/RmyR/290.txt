Guess who\u2019s C.J.\u2019s BFF? The one little girl who he affectionately calls Cookie. Cookie plus C.J. sitting in a tree\u2026 \u201cWhen you had your parent-teacher conference, did Ms. Sunshine talk to you about our kids needing to keep their hands to their selves and them being too touchy feely?\u201d Cookie\u2019s mom asked my husband recently. Ms. Sunshine hadn\u2019t brought the issue to our attention. \u201cDo you and Cookie touch each other at school?\u201d we asked C.J. trying to seem very casual about the whole thing. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said nonchalantly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d we asked, meeting him on the corner of casual and nonchalant. \u201cWe hold hands and hug each \u2018udder,\u201d said C.J. \u201cDo you kiss?\u201d My question earned a wide-eyed look from C.J.\u2019s Dad. \u201cGross!\u2026Yeah, sometimes, Cookie asks me to kiss her on the cheek cause we\u2019s gonna get married.\u201d Cookie might be a good match for C.J. Or, she might confuse our gender nonconforming son\u00a0even more. Cookie is a cutie\u00a0with short brown curly hair, sleepy eyes and a bright smile. She wears old-school red Chucks, Toy Story shirts and carries a Batman backpack filled with her dinosaur toys. She likes all superheroes, but Spiderman\u00a0and Iron Man are her absolute favs. Cookie is very territorial, I mean protective, of C.J. Her and C.J. have little in common, except that they both appear to be gender creative. They are a quirky match made on the preschool playground. Cookie\u2019s identical twin sister, although in a different class, likes to play with them too. She moves fluidly between girl toys and boy toys and girl clothes and boy clothes. Yes, by age three he had perfected his signature pose. When an invite to Cookie and her sister\u2019s pirate-themed fourth birthday party made it into C.J.\u2019s backpack you\u2019d have thought he\u2019d been invited to New York Fashion Week. Finally, the day of the party arrived. It was not a girly pirate theme with pink jolly rogers sporting heart-shaped eye patches. No, this was a legit pirate party and dress up was encouraged. \u201cC.J., we get to dress up for Cookie\u2019s pirate party, isn\u2019t that fun?\u201d \u201cWoo-hoo! I wanna be a princess.\u201d \u201cNo, Cookie wants you to dress like a pirate.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be a pirate, I wanna be a princess.\u201d \u201cBut, it\u2019s Cookie\u2019s party and she wants all of her friends to be pirates.\u201d \u201cWhen it\u2019s my berfday party can my friends dress up how I want them?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d Cripes almighty, that was a big promise that I hope he forgets, but he probably won\u2019t, and I\u2019ll have to deal with that when I get there, but I\u2019m pretty sure all of the boys and dads won\u2019t want to dress as princesses or cheerleaders (although that would be fun for me and my girlfriends to watch, I\u2019m not going to lie). The sassiest superhero of them all. I loaded the pirate into the car. Burgers. Bounce house. Bubbles. Then, face painting. The birthday girls, naturally, got to be first. Cookie\u2019s Sister wanted to be Captain America. Cookie chose Spiderman. Up next? C.J., who was painted into one fierce Wonder Woman. The three gender creative superheroes got together for a picture. \u201cThat\u2019s so funny, the twins wanted to be boys and the boy wanted to be a girl,\u201d I heard quite a few adult partygoers say. Time for balloon animals. Cookie and her sister requested swords. C.J. wanted a pretty pink flower. While the girls waved their swords at C.J.\u00a0 He sniffed his aromatic latex daisy. Gift time! Cookie unwrapped the Super Hero Squad Headquarters that we got for her. Cookie\u2019s Sister unwrapped the My Little Pony with baby pony and stroller. They both hopped up to hug C.J. in gratitude. They lingered and fought over who would release him first. When the embrace was done, C.J. turned to me in silent tears. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, honey?\u201d \u201cI want that My Little Pony.\u201d \u201cWhen it\u2019s your birthday you can get that My Little Pony,\u201d I said, knowing that was a promise I could and would make good on.
