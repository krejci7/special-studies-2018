Weeks before that, he joined the football team and began training. Our house quickly became a popular hangout spot for Chase and his new friends/teammates \u2013 which is what Matt and I have always wanted. (I certainly didn\u2019t buy a Ping-Pong table, pool table and trampoline for my own enjoyment.) We\u2019d rather have all the kids at our house than out who-knows-where doing who-knows-what. We order pizza, put out sodas and heat up the pool. We welcome anywhere from five to 20 teenagers into our home most Friday nights and often on Saturdays and Sundays, too. They are all great kids. They are really good at using their manners and cleaning up when I ask them to. All of Chase\u2019s friends have taken to C.J. without hesitation. The guys who come over are impressed by the flips and tricks he can do on the trampoline. The girls who come over teach him cheers, do his makeup and talk with him about RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. C.J. trying to go unnoticed under the pool table. When Chase gets sick of having his little brother around, C.J. hides under the Ping-Pong table or pool table hoping to go unnoticed while still feeling like he\u2019s part of the action. It works most of the time. All of these weeks we assumed the teenagers knew C.J. is a boy. After attending a Halloween party, Chase and a handful of his friends crashed in our living room. As their rides slowly started arriving to shuttle them home the next morning, the boys collected their things. (They never manage to take home all of their things. We officially have a \u201cLost and Found\u201d by our front door.) One of Chase\u2019s friends was holding the mask he\u2019d worn to the party the night before and asked, \u201cDoes she want my mask?\u201d to no one in particular. \u201cYeah, he probably does,\u201d Matt said. \u201cNo, I was asking if SHE wants my mask. If C.J. wants it,\u201d the friend clarified. \u201cYeah, he probably does,\u201d Matt said again. The friend looked confused. \u201cC.J. is a boy,\u201d Matt said matter-of-factly. \u201cEeeeefffffff meeeeeee,\u201d the friend said, putting his hands to his head. \u201cEff me. I\u2019ve been calling him a \u2018her\u2019 and a \u2018she\u2019 this whole time! Why didn\u2019t you tell me? I feel so bad!\u201d Matt told him it was okay. The friend apologized again before leaving the house and then again a week later when he came over. We assured again him that it\u2019s fine. We\u2019re fine. C.J. is fine. But the friend wasn\u2019t fine. He felt bad and embarrassed. C.J.\u2019s toys in the kitchen while Chase\u2019s friends are over. We told him we aren\u2019t hung-up on pronouns when it comes to C.J. and he prefers we ignore it when he\u2019s misgendered. And, honestly, we are so used to people mistaking him for a girl that we don\u2019t even notice the misgendering most of the time. None of us ever noticed the friend using the wrong pronouns. We\u2019d assumed the teens who spend time in our home knew C.J. is a boy. Chase\u2019s friend reminded us that it\u2019s not always evident \u2013 and, sometimes, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s downright confusing to newcomers. Our lackadaisicalness when it comes to C.J.\u2019s pronouns and misgendering caused one of Chase\u2019s friends (and maybe more, who knows) confusion and embarrassment. I felt bad for the friend; he had the best intentions. How many of Chase\u2019s other friends think his brother is his sister? We\u2019ve done little things to be clearer that C.J. is a boy. You know, we do awkward things like saying his pronouns louder and referring to him as Chase\u2019s brother more often than necessary. Like when someone isn\u2019t fluent in your language and struggling with comprehension so you increase your volume thinking that will help them understand? Yeah, it\u2019s like that. Super effective. As much as I feel bad for Chase\u2019s friend, I feel good because we are educating the teens who spend time in our home. They see we are just as fine with boys in dresses playing with dolls as we are with boys in helmets playing football. We don\u2019t get hung up on pronouns, labels or society\u2019s expectations. Everyone is valued, accepted and loved in our home. I hope they feel that. I help they continue to enjoy our home, our food and, sometimes, our company. If they ever moved on to someone else\u2019s house, I sure would miss their manners and messes and left behind socks.   ", "feedtitle": "Raising My Rainbow"}
