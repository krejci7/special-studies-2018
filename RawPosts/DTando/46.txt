Sex blog, I got some requests for a blog about Gender Identity vs. Sexual Orientation. Happy to oblige! For those of you hip to this scene, it might be something you\u2019ve heard before, perhaps said a bit differently. For those of you still learning, I hope this will serve to clear up some confusion. I apologize in advance for the length of this blog\u2026 although I could have said more, trust me! I\u2019ve heard gender identity described as \u201cwho you are\u201d and sexual orientation as \u201cwho you want to have sex with\u201d. I agree with this, but there\u2019s a lot more to it. Gender identity refers to what gender your brain is, who you are, and how you want others to see you. What gender you identify with is going to impact many areas of your life, if not all. It will affect how you are seen in society, how others respond to you, how you are addressed, expectations for your behavior, where you go to the bathroom, your role in your family, and much more. Sexual orientation refers to who you are attracted to, who you would like to receive romantic attention/affection from, and who you would like to be sexually intimate with. I\u2019d even like to say sexual orientation not only refers to the sex (anatomy) one is attracted to, but also the gender. Certainly, anatomy plays a big part in sexual relationships, but the gender of the individual is likely what captures your attention in the first place. I would also suggest that gender is more of a factor in dating and relationships than one\u2019s anatomy. Ultimately, who you are sexually attracted to doesn\u2019t have a lot to do with who you are and how you present on a day-to-day basis. To whom you are attracted doesn\u2019t matter when you are checking out at the grocery store. Since our standard greetings don\u2019t entail \u201cHello, Lesbian\u201d and \u201cThank you, Gay Man\u201d but \u201cHello, Ma\u2019am\u201d and \u201cThank you, Sir\u201d, you can see how gender identity is a more pervasive issue and one that affects an individual even more regularly than sexual orientation. Who you go to bed with that night doesn\u2019t matter when you\u2019re out interacting with society. Additionally, one may not go to bed with anyone that night\u2026 or have a sex life to speak of, but one\u2019s gender and how it impacts a person is unavoidable. Do children have a gender identity? Yes, usually children have a clear understanding of being either a boy or a girl. If you can\u2019t remember thinking about your gender as a child, it\u2019s likely because your assigned gender matched with your natal* sex. (*Natal meaning \u201cof, relating to, or present at birth; associated with one\u2019s birth\u201d. In this blog when I say \u201cnatal male\u201d or \u201cnatal female\u201d it is referring to one\u2019s anatomy, or sex, present at birth.) Do children have a sexual orientation? Not really. Children are not sexual beings. However, at what age do you remember \u201cliking\u201d or having crushes on other people? Developmentally, this usually happens in elementary school. \u201cWanting to have sex with\u201d either girls or boys is not usually a factor during elementary school! However, whispering about, sending notes to, and giggling in the presence of one\u2019s crush usually is. Therefore, it is at this age when some children realize they are interested in members of the same sex, but this won\u2019t become a sexual idea for some time. I remember many years ago watching a Larry King show with transgender guests. He asked a trans man (who was in a relationship with a female), \u201cWouldn\u2019t it just have been easier to stay a lesbian?\u201d. While the question seemed absurd to me at the time, I suppose it echoes the questions of many people who don\u2019t understand the need to transition. Easier? Yes, I suppose avoiding transition would be the easier choice in some ways.\u00a0 The better choice? No. Opting to live a life in a gender that feels foreign is the making of a rough journey.\u00a0 Staying socially/biologically female and being a lesbian would allow the individual to continue to sleep with women, but all other areas of life would be more difficult. For example, think of the names \u201cMom\u201d and \u201cDad\u201d. If the trans man were to live his life \u201cas a lesbian\u201d and had children, his name might be \u201cMom\u201d or a version thereof. This simply doesn\u2019t fit with his gender identity and would likely sound as strange to him as it would to any natal male who is a father.\u00a0 Another example would be this same person (continuing to present as female) taking [his] wife out to dinner, and the server says, \u201cHello, Ladies\u201d. Cringing inside every time [he] hears the reference to [himself] as female is most certainly not the \u201ceasier\u201d way to go. Additionally, asking a trans man about \u201cstaying a lesbian\u201d is actually a misnomer. A trans man is not, and never has been, a lesbian. Yes, many transgender individuals come out as gay prior to understanding their gender identity or coming out as trans. \u00a0Because being gay is presently more accepted and understood than being transgender, this may be the only way a transgender individual knows how to identify at first. If a natal female is attracted to women, [s]he may assume [s]he is a lesbian and may come out as such, before realizing he actually identifies as male. Often times one\u2019s gender identity is understood later which then invalidates a previously thought sexual orientation. The fact that gender identity and sexual orientation are two separate entities is precisely why someone can be transgender AND gay. For example, a natal male who has the brain gender identity of a female may transition to a woman and also be attracted to women, thereby making her a lesbian. (Stew on that one, Larry King!) I can hear it now, \u201cIf the male were attracted to women already, why transition to be a woman only then to be a lesbian? Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to stay a straight man?\u201d. Forgive me if I\u2019m being redundant, but this person never was a straight man and therefore could not \u201cstay\u201d one.\u00a0 The above-referenced person could date women, but would perceived as a straight man, which would likely cause great distress. This is because one\u2019s gender identity is a pervasive, essential fact to everything one does during the day. One\u2019s sex life is only an element. While these two concepts are different, they are not entirely separate.\u00a0Gender identity and sexual orientation affect one another in the bedroom. Sexual relations are not only about who you want to sleep with, but how you want your sex partner to treat and perceive you. A transgender woman will likely want to be treated sexually as a woman, whether she is choosing to be sexual with a man or a woman. \u00a0This is because the former is about gender identity, the latter about sexual orientation. Additionally, one\u2019s gender identity must be factored in to understand one\u2019s sexual orientation. To summarize gender identity: Someone with a male gender identity (natal male or not) will want to be treated as a man in the grocery store, by society, by his family, and in the bedroom. Someone with a female gender identity (natal female or not) will want to be treated as a woman in the grocery store, by society, by her family, and in the bedroom. To summarize sexual orientation: Someone with a male gender identity (natal male or not) who is attracted to men is gay. Someone with a male gender identity (natal male or not) who is attracted to women is straight. Someone with a female gender identity (natal female or not) who is attracted to men is straight. Someone with a female gender identity (natal female or not) who is attracted to women is gay. Of course, I\u2019m as opposed to boxes as anyone else\u2026 there are all sorts of beautiful nuances of both sexuality and gender identity! Please forgive me for making this blog seem like both are black and white. This was for the sake of simplicity.", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
