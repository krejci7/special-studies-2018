It seems that Power School (the computer system used by most schools in SD) will allow for a \u201cpreferred name\u201d field, but it still prints the birth name next to the preferred name on all the rosters, etc. So not helpful! Also, there is no updated or preferred gender marker box. Guess what? Anyone in administration at the school can manually go into Power School and change the birth name and gender to the preferred name and gender. Simple as that. I\u2019ve had three schools in San Diego do this now. Assertively ask your school administrators to do this for your child. If your school still will not do this, ask how they will handle\u00a0attendance sheets when there is a substitute. Additionally, send emails to each of your child\u2019s teachers. (This is for children who are about to transition or are currently transitioning, not those who have already transitioned.) One of my client\u2019s mothers wrote this email to each of her child\u2019s teachers, and I absolutely love it. \u201cDear [Teacher], My child [name] is in your\u00a0first period\u00a0[subject] class. [Preferred name]\u00a0\u2018gender-identifies\u2019 as a male, and I would like to ask you to make very certain that you reference him (purposely, but not obviously) with his preferred name of [preferred name] rather than his legal name and that you use he/him/his pronouns at all times, modeling that for the other students in the class.\u00a0 One of [preferred name]\u2019s biggest concerns in life is \u201cpassing,\u201d being regarded and thought of on first glance as male. The kids look to their teachers for cues when they\u2019re unsure, and with your leadership in setting a firm precedent from the beginning as to [preferred name]\u2019s gender, there should be no confusion about it in your class. Thank you in advance! Sincerely, [Parent]\u201d Email me with success stories, questions, or concerns about this issue to tandotherapy@me.com. Thank you!", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
