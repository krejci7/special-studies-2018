It\u2019s the story of young Ryland, a transgender boy who was allowed to socially transition at the age of 5. To see the video, click here. As a gender therapist, and a gender therapist who also works with transgender children, I\u2019m thrilled to see this video in mainstream media: Huffington Post, People.com, Upworthy.com. It\u2019s bringing awareness to an extremely important issue: not just that transgender children can transition, but it drives home the point that transgender people are born transgender. The age that one is consciously aware of being transgender or transitions can vary widely, but an individual does not become transgender over the course of their lifetime. I had the honor of speaking about this issue on Good Morning America. To see the clip, click here. I said a lot more than what was aired, but there\u2019s only so much they could fit into a 4-minute news segment. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to address some of those things now. These points are in direct response to the questions I was asked by Good Morning America about the video. Regular readers of this blog are probably well-versed in the answers below, but in case this post is read by someone seeking more education or to understand young transgender children, I wanted to be thorough. Many people were surprised to read that 41% of transgender individuals have attempted suicide, while the rate of the general population is 4.6%. That staggering statistic, I believe, applies to transgender individuals who transition later in life and meet with familial/societal resistance, rejection, or shame. \u201cNew analysis of responses to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS) shows that transgender respondents who experienced rejection by family and friends, discrimination, victimization, or violence have a higher risk of attempting suicide.\u201d I strongly believe that number will plummet in the coming years with increased awareness, education, and accepting, responsive families like Ryland\u2019s. To read the full report from the Williams Institute, click here. I was asked questions about what interventions are recommended for transgender children. For a transgender child as young as 5 or 6, the first step is social transition. This means changing pronouns, sometimes name, and some societal markers of gender such as haircut or dress. No medical interventions happen at this stage, contrary to some sensationalistic beliefs. The first medical interventions would be just before the onset of puberty, at which time hormone blockers would be introduced to prevent the body from going through the \u201cwrong\u201d puberty. As the teen ages, cross-sex hormones would be administered to initiate puberty of the preferred sex, which would produce some much-desired \u201cgender markers\u201d. When a child has been clear about their gender identity and not transitioning causes distress, transitioning young can be incredibly beneficial to the individual. While not all transgender people are focused on \u201cpassing\u201d, it is hugely important to many. \u201cPassing\u201d means being read in society as the gender with which you identify in your brain. Going to the grocery store and having the cashier address them with the correct gender pronouns\u2026 that is \u201cpassing\u201d. Transitioning early and intervening before puberty takes over will allow that individual to pass as his or her \u201ctrue\u201d gender without question. One thing I want to say is that I know many people worry that a very young child is too young to make such a big \u201cdecision\u201d. I want to remind you that gender identity is not a decision. We all know very early on what gender we are. A transgender child of Ryland\u2019s age is not making a \u201chuge decision\u201d to be a boy. He IS a boy. His parents were faced with a huge decision about allowing him to transition, and they made it based on Ryland\u2019s asserted gender identity. I thought Good Morning America did a good job of covering this video. I was pleased about the input from ABC\u2019s Chief Health and Medical Editor, Dr. Richard Besser. \u201cThe more we\u2019re learning about gender, the more we\u2019re learning that this is really hard-wired. It\u2019s hard-wired in the brain. And from very early, from the first couple years of life, children will recognize gender and then start to identify with gender.\u201d My only feedback would be that he should have used male pronouns when referring to a transgender boy. One thing that didn\u2019t sit right with me was the way they worded the \u201cteaser\u201d for the upcoming segment on the video. \u201cTrue Identity: The incredible story being shared coast to coast of one little girl who just wanted to be a boy. Why her parents encouraged her to change gender.\u201d This statement is misleading at best. First of all, this child is not a little girl. This child did not \u201cwant to be a boy\u201d, this child has the brain gender identity of a boy. As the video said, this child did not say \u201cI want to be a boy\u201d, he said \u201cI AM a boy\u201d. Now, I understand those snippets are meant to be short and can\u2019t cover it all, and they are geared to having people tune in to watch the segment. The part that got me the most was the last sentence: \u201cWhy her parents encouraged her to change gender.\u201d If you are the parent of a transgender child, you probably understand why that sounds a little silly. Do these parents have some sort of ulterior motive to have a transgender child? Doubt it. Was this in their master plan? Likely not. Many of the parents of young transgender children I work with struggle extensively during the process of understanding their child\u2019s true gender identity. It takes time to accept their child is transgender, and naturally, parents tend to agonize over allowing their child to transition. Supporting and responding appropriately to their child\u2019s gender identity is not encouraging something that wasn\u2019t there; you can\u2019t make a child transgender. However, supporting and encouraging the child to live life as their true selves, that is selfless, unconditional love. For more reflections on how difficult and intense this journey can be for parents, see my blog post \u201cFeelin\u2019 The Love: Watching the Journey of Parents\u201d. In the video, the song fades from \u201cHallelujah\u201d by Jeff Buckley to \u201cGood Life\u201d by One Republic as it shows Ryland transitioning. I think it was the perfect song choice. So many parents worry whether or not their transgender child can have a good life. The answer is: ABSOLUTELY. Thank you to Ryland and his family for being selfless and strong enough to share your story so that many more transgender children can have good lives, just like you.", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
