Some people have two different colored eyes, and some people don\u2019t. Some people are allergic to dairy, and some people are not. Some people are transgender, and some people are not. In some of the trainings I do, I ask the question: when is gender pathological? It\u2019s basically a trick question, because gender isn\u2019t pathological. Gender just is. It has neither good nor bad qualities. Yes, distress can come from feeling like your exterior presentation does not match your brain gender identity, and distress can come from society not understanding your gender, but gender in and of itself isn\u2019t distressing. It just is, and we all have a gender identity even if that gender identity means not having a gender at all. Some people are transgender, and some people are not. Parents come to me with various theories for why their child may be transgender, or at least \u201cpresenting\u201d as transgender. I\u2019ve heard many different theories over the course of my years in working with transgender children, and many similar ones. I think space needs to be held for these parents wondering \u201cwhy?\u201d, and their theories should be listened to and considered. However, sooner rather than later there needs to be a time to take the \u201cwhy?\u201d and replace that with \u201cOK, now what?\u201d. In the end, the \u201cwhy\u201d doesn\u2019t really matter. What matters is the child\u2019s happiness. My theory? Some people are transgender, and some people are not. Some people wrongly believe that being transgender is some form or sign of mental illness. In fact, even some professionals will use the term \u201cco-occurring\u201d when they speak of someone being transgender along with having a mental illness. Being transgender is not a mental illness. There is not a certain \u201ctype\u201d of person with a certain set of presenting problems who is transgender. Say it with me: Some people are transgender, and some people are not. *********** *This blog post is going live on October, 24, 2015, the International Day of Action for Trans Depathologization, an annual\u00a0day created by Campaign Stop Trans Pathologization. Let\u2019s stop pathologizing gender\u2026 because simply some people are transgender, and some people are not.", "feedtitle": "Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
