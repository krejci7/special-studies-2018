Being the child of a superstar like Cher, coming out as trans and transitioning under the spotlight no doubt makes a frightening and difficult process all the more so. He has been very visible and vocal in order to educate the public and pave the way for other transgender individuals. As he said on the Oprah special, \u201cI\u2019m doing this because I want to try to help people\u2026I want to try to put a face on an issue that people don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s why I did this publicly.\u201d And now to push himself further out of his comfort zone and appear on Dancing With the Stars\u2026 wow. My hat\u2019s off to you, Chaz. He said something in response to a question from a fan about his mother Cher\u2019s response to his transition that really stuck with me, and I think it summarizes an aspect of one\u2019s gender transition beautifully. The fan said, \u201cI would think your mom would accept it real well!\u201d Chaz\u2019s response? \u201cIt\u2019s hard for moms.\u201d Yes, even Cher. Even the leather-wearing, booty-revealing, sex symbol/gay icon mom! This process is indeed hard for moms; likely for all parents and guardians. This element is something that is a large part of the work I do with my transgender clients. Inevitably my job in therapy is part helping the individual transition and process emotions that accompany that; part is helping them cope with responses from others and understand what the process might be like for their loved ones. When becoming a parent, the prospect of one\u2019s child becoming a different gender than originally thought is not usually within one\u2019s realm of possibility. Parents often begin planning, fantasizing, and formulating expectations for their child\u2019s life as soon as they\u2019re born; often as soon as they are conceived. Gender plays a big part in these expectations which then have to shift a great deal when the gender nonconformity or different gender identity is revealed. \u00a0This comes as a shock to most parents, and it can be difficult to wrap one\u2019s brain around, particularly if the parents have not previously had experience with someone who is gender variant. Of course, responses vary from one extreme to the other. Some parents get on board soon after hearing their child verbally reveal their true gender identity. Although rare, this can be related to seeing many signs of gender variance since early childhood, or sensing an unknown source of distress and seeing the relief the gender revelation brings. Other parents fight it and resist for many years, struggling to have any type of acceptance. This is the more common response, likely due to the parents having to shift ideas they had been formulating about their child\u2019s life since the child was born. There is also a distinct element of fear; fear they will \u201close\u201d their child, or that their child will become unfamiliar to them. This usually is not the case (post-transition often being easier than expected and realizing their child is still the same person), but that \u201cWhat If?\u201d is sure powerful. I have sat in many a session and witnessed two people in pain: the transgender individual, wanting desperately to be accepted and supported in the daunting process of transitioning, and the parent, wishing this were not true, wanting it to go away. Some of the feelings a loved one might feel are likely similar to feelings the transgender person has already gone through prior to disclosing their gender identity or plans to transition. Many have walked through the fear, the wishing away, the major adjustment to how life is going to change. If you are a gender variant person expressing your true gender or looking to transition, and your mom, parent, or loved one is struggling with it, take heart. Even though it\u2019s hard for them, acceptance is possible. It may be closer than you think. While you are on your own journey, your loved ones are on theirs, and all of you deserve compassion, patience, and tolerance. When you find yourself getting discouraged, remind yourself, \u201cIt\u2019s hard for ___________\u201d, filling in the blank with your loved one who is struggling. If you are a parent of a gender non-conforming child or adult, and you have struggled with negative feelings about your child\u2019s gender expression or transition, be kind to yourself. No matter where you fall on the spectrum of acceptance, please don\u2019t judge yourself for having feelings about this. It\u2019s important you take care of yourself while taking care of your child. Having feelings of fear, dread, sadness, or loss doesn\u2019t make you bad; it makes you human. Walking through these feelings to get to the other side is a part of the process. I can\u2019t underscore the importance of getting to the other side, though\u2026 and eventually being able to support your child\u2019s decision with the unconditional love they absolutely need, no matter how old they are. The significance of the parent/child relationship is both what makes this difficult on you, and why your acceptance is crucial to your child\u2019s happiness. Ultimately, your acceptance will likely be one of the most important aspects on your child\u2019s journey. So on this journey to acceptance and support (and anyone can get there!), validate your feelings, find a place to be heard, talk to other parents in your situation. Because yes\u2026 it\u2019s hard for moms.", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
