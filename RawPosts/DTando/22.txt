The question is worth asking, but the answer may not be a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d. Most people are pretty darn sure of their gender identity. Cisgender and transgender alike, most are pretty darn sure. What confounds things is that only transgender people have to navigate through having a brain gender identity that differs from their birth sex, and having to first understand and then explain this to others. Still, most are pretty darn sure. Remember, gender identity is different than making the decision to transition. Often times, knowing one\u2019s gender identity is the \u201ceasy\u201d part. Pursuing a life to align one\u2019s gender presentation with one\u2019s brain gender identity? Now that\u2019s the more challenging part. So, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d. If you are a loved one who finds yourself asking this question, try to clarify what you are asking about. Are you asking about your loved one\u2019s gender identity or plans to transition? If you separate the two, you may find more confidence in the first than the latter. If your loved one is sure of their (trans)gender identity, asking if they are sure about their transition may contribute to fears and anxieties surrounding this \u201cdecision\u201d. Instead, ask \u201cHow can I help? What\u2019s the first step?\u201d. Many clients I\u2019ve met with who are contemplating transition have said to me, \u201cI want to be 100% sure\u201d. \u00a0My clients tend to be intelligent, high-functioning individuals who are used to doing things well, and they want this to be no exception. They research, they inquire, they ruminate, they agonize, they weigh the risks and benefits ad nauseum. After all this, they are still \u201cnot sure\u201d. Why? Because there ARE risks, and because the process isn\u2019t easy. Therefore, anxiety about this huge undertaking can be interpreted as not being \u201csure\u201d. Again, not so much about the gender identity- if I can bring them back to that aspect of themselves instead of just the \u201cdecision\u201d to transition, they are much more sure about their gender identity. A good example might be left-handedness. People are born left-handed, no? It used to be lefties were encouraged to use their right hands until it became habit. Gender identity is similar in that it is inborn. \u00a0It can be stifled to present differently, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good for the person. And what gender one presents as is far more pervasive than which hand is dominant! One of my clients, a happy and insightful trans man, made mention to not feeling completely sure until AFTER he had transitioned. I later contacted him to write a little blurb for this blog post, and he delivered beautifully. Here is what he had to say: \u201cTo be honest I wasn\u2019t 100% sure about transitioning until I was already pretty far into it. One day about 4 years in I looked in the mirror and for the first time in my life I recognized myself. I don\u2019t think you\u00a0can ever be 100% sure about anything in life, any decision, any path\u2026it\u2019s all educated guesses wrapped up in a hope for happiness.\u201d Isn\u2019t this the case for most things? We make huge decisions all the time that will affect the rest of our lives: where to live, where to go to school, the career path to follow, to marry or not to marry, if yes who to marry, to have kids or not have kids, if yes how many, etc. Yet these decisions typically aren\u2019t as agonized over as much or as misunderstood as gender transition. I\u2019m reluctant to compare gender transition to getting married, but the analogy really sticks in my mind. How many people are \u201csure\u201d when they get married that they will be with the other person \u201cforever\u201d? Of the couples who eventually divorce, if you could ask them \u201cbut were you SURE when you got married?\u201d, most of them would unequivocally say \u201cyes\u201d. Some may argue that gender transition is a more \u201cserious\u201d decision than getting married, but is it? Marriages often result in children, who are thereby affected by a divorce if it were to occur. If a capable individual decides to get married, they get married. However, if a capable individual decides to go through gender transition, the issue of being \u201csure\u201d is one they will have to answer over and over again. I guess it\u2019s because other people can understand marriage, but have a harder time wrapping their brains around gender transition. However, this should not matter when it comes to others and their decisions about their own lives. Not to mention the rate of transgender individuals later \u201cchanging their minds\u201d about transition is FAR, FAR less than the current rate of successful vs. unsuccessful marriages! I suppose feeling more at ease with one\u2019s decision comes down to trust. If your loved one is telling you who they are what they have decided to do, trust them. If you are transgender and have decided to transition, trust yourself. If the person making this decision is of sound judgment and mind, there is no real reason to think this is an irrational decision that will ever be regretted. Additionally, if one has come to the decision to transition, it has not come lightly. Many transgender people agonize about the decision to transition long after one\u2019s true gender identity has become consciously aware. Perhaps being \u201csure\u201d is an evolutionary process, and one that can only happen after the first step. I do know that trusting yourself is a good idea\u2026 of that I am sure.  For those of you how have transitioned, how \u201csure\u201d did you feel before? After?", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
