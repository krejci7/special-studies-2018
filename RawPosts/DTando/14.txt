There\u2019s something happening, folks, in the teenage and adult minds across America. It\u2019s an epidemic. It can cause anxiety, distress, and indecision. What is it? It\u2019s overthinking. \u201cWe are dying from overthinking. We are slowly killing ourselves by thinking about everything. Think. Think. Think. You can never trust the human mind anyway. It\u2019s a death trap.\u201d \u2015Anthony Hopkins Sometimes a client will ask me a question that causes me to pause and wonder how in the world they ever ended up at that question in the first place. My friends, some of these questions have to be the result of overthinking, because they seem to transform a somewhat simple concept into something very complicated and convoluted. If you are my client, you may have heard me ask the following question a time or two during our sessions together: \u201cIs it possible you\u2019re overthinking things?\u201d. \u201cSome thoughts should never be conceived. Some questions should never be asked, because they have no answer, and the questions themselves serve only to haunt with grinding guilt and second guessing.\u201d \u2015Bobby Adair, Slow Burn: Dead Fire So, how does this concept relate to gender and gender transition? My argument is that overthinking can be a transgender person contemplating transition\u2019s worst nightmare. All steps, stages, and possible outcomes are analyzed to death, creating fear and hesitation. This is the beauty of a transgender child being allowed to transition: overthinking is not part of the process. They just are, and therefore they just do. Adults seem to have the impression that the more they think about something, the surer they become. In my experience, both personally and vicariously, the opposite is often times true. \u201cThe more you overthink the less you will understand.\u201d \u00a0\u2015Habeeb Akande Children, and adults, know their gender identity. The difference is that knowing what to do about it is either subject to overthinking or not. Given a child\u2019s pure mind, you can rest assured they will have more simple answers than we do, and sometimes simple is exactly what you need. For adults contemplating transition, what would the child inside you say to do?

In the end I just went with the majority on the internet and how my iphone auto-corrected. If you think the word should be hyphenated, sorry. Don\u2019t think about it too much.", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
