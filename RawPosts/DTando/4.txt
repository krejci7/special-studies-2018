Well, I wrote a book! F + W Media, Inc. has a series called \u201cThe Conscious Parent\u2019s Guide To\u2026\u201d about a number of different topics. They wanted to publish one on gender identity, found me through this blog, and asked me to write it! I was happy to have the opportunity to write about how to best support gender expansive kids to a more wide-reaching audience. I truly hope it helps a lot of families. The book is ideal for parents/guardians of gender expansive kids, but could also be useful for extended family members, therapists, teachers; anyone involved in a gender expansive child\u2019s life. Click here to order your copy: The Conscious Parent\u2019s Guide to Gender Identity: A Mindful Approach to Embracing Your Child\u2019s Authentic Self. I do want to add that I did not write Chapter 1. Chapter 1 is the standard chapter for all of the Conscious Parent\u2019s Guides. I only added in the parts related to gender. So, if you don\u2019t love Chapter 1- keep going.  If you liked Chapter 1 best, sorry.  In addition to the overview in Chapter 1 about conscious parenting, there are ways to incorporate being a mindful, conscious parent throughout the book. This is so much more than just being \u201cpresent\u201d, it\u2019s about recognizing your little human as a separate being, with their own unique will and spirit. I write about how to best connect with your child in order to be most receptive to what they are trying to tell you. I write about the differences between gender and sex, gender identity and sexual orientation, gender expression vs. gender identity, and what gender \u201cexpansiveness\u201d really is. This not only helps those involved in a gender expansive child\u2019s life understand these concepts, but helps explain them to others. I discuss the concept of getting to know one\u2019s child for who they are from the beginning, rather than making assumptions that later need to be shifted or undone. I write about parenting gender expansive children, and the difference between being transgender and \u201cjust\u201d gender expansive. In the book you will find practical tips for interacting with and advocating for your gender expansive and/or transgender child, while learning how to trust yourself and appreciate life at the same time. Later in the book there is more specific information for families who have a child in need of social or medical transition: how/when to navigate interventions, coping with outside influences/reactions, siblings, extended family, schools, etc. There is a specific chapter dedicated to \u201chelping your gender expansive child with teasing\u201d, based on the concepts I present at gender conferences. There is also a specific chapter dedicated to dysphoria, which is important for everyone involved in a transgender child\u2019s life to understand. The appendixes include some resources I hope you will find helpful, including ways of looking at natal sex/gender identity/gender expression/sexual orientation on spectrums, or on more of a fluid shape. There is a list of \u201cClassroom Rules\u201d to help classrooms promote diversity. There is also a worksheet for children who may need some help in understanding when a friend or loved one is going through transition. Last but not least, there is a sample letter from parents informing their loved ones about their child\u2019s social transition. Let me know how you like the book, and leave an honest review on Amazon! Thank you so much for your ongoing support of this blog, I promise to get back to writing regular posts soon.", "feedtitle": "Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
