My goal of this video is to raise awareness and acceptance of transgender youth and adults. Being transgender is NOT a mental illness, it is just a variation of the human condition. We need more understanding and more allies!! Those who are transgender should not live in shame or in fear of coming out. And for those who face adversity every day, here is my reminder to try your best to \u201cshake it off\u201d. For any one person who is against you, there are more people who will stand for you. A sincere\u00a0thanks to everyone who contributed videos for this project, and to my sister Emily who sang the modified lyrics. Enjoy the video below, and feel free to share!
