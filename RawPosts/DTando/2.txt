In 2015, I had a lot of fun creating a fun and uplifting video montage to Taylor Swift’s “Shake it Off” video. To view that video, click HERE. I decided it was time to create a new one! This year, I used “Can’t Stop the Feeling” by Justin Timberlake. I had such a wonderful time putting together all the videos people sent me. To see the JOY on these faces touches my heart in a way that is hard to explain. I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed creating it!  Click HERE.
