A woman I was speaking with recently made reference to a transgender acquaintance of hers: \u201cHe is in the process of becoming transgender.\u201d \u201cTransitioning\u201d, I said. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked. \u201cTransitioning is the process\u201d, I said. \u00a0\u201cBeing transgender is who he is.\u201d One does not \u201cbecome\u201d transgender. One is born transgender.\u00a0 What one eventually does with that is an entirely different issue, and is different for every individual. Understanding, knowing, discovering, realizing one\u2019s gender identity is a unique process for everyone. Some people understand what gender they are from the very start, never think about it, and never have to worry about it, not even once in their entire lives. These people are usually those whose biological sex match the gender of their brains. For transgender individuals, coming to understand their personal gender can look many different ways. Some have an immediate sense of identifying as the \u201copposite\u201d gender (forgive my reference to the gender dichotomy!) and depending on temperament, family influence, etc. that awareness can cause very different levels of distress in the individual. Some are vocal about it, since childhood. Some guard it like a secret. Some don\u2019t really know exactly what\u2019s going on, but they have a sense there is something not quite right. Some individuals don\u2019t realize their gender doesn\u2019t match their biological sex until they are much older, but when they do, a lot of pieces fall into place. (Having a child or family member not realize until they are much older is often more difficult for the family members, but that\u2019s a subject for another blog!) By the time a client makes it to my office, he or she is usually pretty darn sure about his or her gender identity. In fact, MOST transgender clients I come into contact with are completely sure of what gender they are. I have been known to facetiously say, \u201cthat\u2019s the easy part!\u201d. After understanding and coming to peace with one\u2019s gender identity, the next task is deciding what he or she is going to DO about it. For those of you not completely savvy with all the concepts and terms, the process of aligning one\u2019s biological sex with one\u2019s gender identity is called \u201ctransitioning\u201d.\u00a0 Mainly this includes changing one\u2019s appearance, name, and pronouns to \u201cpresent\u201d as the gender with which he or she identifies. It often includes hormones and sometimes includes surgery. This is the hard part. Much of the agony for my clients comes from not trying to figure out what gender they are, but what they are going to do about it. Transitioning from one gender to the other, and coping with all that entails, is a very scary thing.\u00a0 Some clients will come saying they identify as \u201cthird gender\u201d or something in the middle. (Of course, some people really feel this way, and they refer to themselves as genderqueer. In this blog I\u2019m discussing those who ultimately identify as transgender.)\u00a0 What usually causes someone who is transgender to say this is the fear of the transition. In this case it is the \u201cwhat to do\u201d wreaking havoc on the \u201cwho I am\u201d! In my experience with my clients, fear of transitioning mainly comes from outside sources. \u00a0They may fear the reaction of significant others, family members, co-workers, or society at large.\u00a0 If the fear of this remains greater than the desire to make themselves happy by aligning their body with their mind, the transgender person may decide not to pursue transitioning. This does not make the person any less transgender. It just means too much got in the way of doing what they needed to do for themselves, to make themselves happy.\u00a0 Having a transgender person decide not to transition is not cause for a sigh of relief, it is often cause for concern.\u00a0 Not transitioning due to fear of reactions or to please others may be the recipe for an unhappy future. For some, deciding to transition is easy, even if the process is still a challenging one. Once their gender identity is realized, transitioning to match their body and outer appearance is a natural next step. For many transgender individuals, transitioning is a very positive process, one that brings much relief, joy, and satisfaction. It\u2019s my wish that over time, with an increased understanding of what it means to be transgender and extensive de-pathologizing of the concept, the gap between who someone is and what he or she is going to do about it will become much, much smaller. To my transgender friends, clients, and blog followers, I\u2019d love to hear your feedback about this! Either comment on this blog or email me privately.
