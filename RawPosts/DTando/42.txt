If the transgender person chooses to go through the process of changing their\u00a0gender, they are\u00a0aligning themselves\u00a0with their \u201creal\u201d gender. There are several definitions of align; the one I choose for this topic is \u201cto move or be adjusted into proper relationship or orientation\u201d. It\u2019s critical people understand the choice to transition is a way of making things right, not deciding to change something that is already perfect. Deciding to align oneself is typically the result of many years of contemplation, possible ambivalence, agonizing, the weighing of options, and considering all outcomes.\u00a0 Finally making the \u201cbig decision\u201d can bring on feelings of relief, gratitude, and excitement, mainly because they have decided to ALIGN themselves, and that is a positive thing. Yet these feelings are not usually shared by the loved ones of the transgender individual. They are the ones who have to fully transition from an idea they have about who their loved one is to something different. Transition: \u201cchange or passage from one state or stage to another\u201d. When you reveal your gender identity and/or plans to align yourself, you are asking your loved one to adjust to the idea that you are about to change, when they like you just the way you are. \u00a0 (Additionally, the change loved ones anticipate tends to be more dramatic than what happens in reality, so there is fear involved here, too.)\u00a0 They are often presented with years of your contemplation delivered in one single revelation; in a moment they are forced to adjust to an entirely different idea of you than they had in the moment before. Hundreds of things likely go through their heads in that moment; things that you have been contemplating for some time now. Whatever their initial reaction, remind yourself they are playing \u201ccatch up\u201d and will likely need some time. Although all of you are involved in this big change, these two perspectives can make this experience very different for each of you. This depends on whether you are aligning yourself with something that feels better to you, or having to transition to an idea that feels altogether foreign. The Cold Lake Analogy Picture this: you want to go swimming in a very cold lake. You first stick your toe in, shiver a bit, but forge ahead. Slowly, inch by inch, you submerge your body in the lake. It\u2019s uncomfortable, but you\u2019re determined to take a swim. Once you have been treading water for about 5-10 minutes, the water seems to feel much warmer. Eventually it\u2019s hard to remember you thought the water was cold at all. You see your friend and yell, \u201cCome on in, the water\u2019s fine!\u201d. They\u00a0stick their\u00a0toe in. Their\u00a0response? \u201cAre you serious?? It\u2019s FREEZING!\u201d. \u00a0Looking at you submerged in the water, smiling, your friend just can\u2019t understand what it is you are doing, or how it feels good to you. This tends to be the way a loved one looks upon the transition; by the time the transgender individual \u201ccomes out\u201d, they have\u00a0been adjusting to the \u201cwater\u201d for much longer. One thing to keep in mind from this analogy is that the water both people are feeling is the exact same water; the same temperature. The difference in their interpretations of the feeling of the water largely comes from how long each has been getting used to it. The positive spin on this is that given more time, the other person may be treading water before you know it.  To the loved ones of transgender individuals: when your loved one reveals their plans to align themselves with their brain gender identity, please keep in mind they are\u00a0revealing a way to make themselves right. They are not doing something to you, or trying to disrupt something you like just the way it is. They are trying to be whole; they are trying to be happy. To the transgender individuals, this is my gentle reminder that you are asking your loved ones to jump into a very cold lake! Be patient, be kind (to them and yourselves) and keep your eye on the prize\u2026 YOU, aligned.", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
