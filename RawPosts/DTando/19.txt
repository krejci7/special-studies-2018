I\u2019ve heard several parents say this impending loss feels like a death, and they prepare to grieve accordingly. It\u2019s never really that they are feeling that way; usually they are scared they are going to feel that way when their child transitions. I tell them most parents end up not feeling that way, as their child will still be here, but they won\u2019t know this until they go through it themselves. Really, the parent is not losing their child. The child (again, I\u2019m talking about \u201cadult children\u201d, too) is going to be the same person they always were. The parent is only now beginning to understand what pronouns and gender identity go along with who their child really is. The main loss is that of pronouns and a mental image of who the parent thought they were. Recently, a father made it clear he had not experienced loss as a result of his child\u2019s transition. I wanted desperately to bottle up his words and give them to each parent I see who is struggling with a sense of impending loss in regards to their transgender child. So, I did the next best thing; I asked him to write a blog post about it! Without further ado, please read these words from a father who has gained so much. \u201cAnti-Loss \u2013 By Peter T. Emma was our second child, born from the love her mother and I shared and wanted to manifest in the world. \u00a0In the days after we learned she was pregnant, my wife and I had no idea if she would give birth to a boy or a girl \u2013 and to both of us, it made no difference, whatsoever. Whether our baby, our child, our young adult was a boy or a girl was pretty much irrelevant, as long as they grew up happy, strong, knowing they were deeply loved and accepted for their unique and beautiful self. Our baby was born in the body of a girl\u2026 but in this baby, nature decided to do an interesting thing. Somehow, the heart and mind and spirit of a son was inserted into the body of a girl. \u00a0We as parents, being such literal and visual creatures, took the visual presentation of our baby to be all we needed to know about gender. \u00a0The doctor said \u201cIt\u2019s a girl!\u201d and we believed. \u00a0We went about dressing our baby and our child as a girl\u2026 giving \u201cher\u201d girl activities\u2026 and investing in our expectations about what \u201cshe\u201d would grow up to be. As our child grew up and was able to begin to make choices in clothing, friends and activities, it was gradually apparent that our ideas about \u201cbeing a girl\u201d weren\u2019t really fitting this small person. \u00a0Still, we took our child to ballet lessons and set up tea parties with classmates, bought cute dresses and imagined the life-ahead for \u201cher\u201d \u2013 and our child seemed to participate in these things happily\u2026 up to a point, but beneath the seemingly-accepting exterior of this small person, inner turmoil was brewing. We, as parents of transgender teens, all have our stories of how our child made their truth known to us and how we initially \u2013 and then eventually \u2013 reacted to their needs. \u00a0I won\u2019t lengthen this writing by sharing mine in detail, but I will acknowledge that I definitely had to go through my own reprogramming\u2026 adjusting in some fundamental ways, how I perceived my child. \u00a0The child I had known for 13 years as Emma now was to be called Andrew\u2026 \u201cshe\u201d was to be \u201che\u201d and a whole new world of concerns for his welfare appeared \u2013 in addition to the ones that come standard with every teen. I have been so very fortunate to be included in my son Andrew\u2019s counseling sessions. \u00a0All sorts of truths rise to the surface there that \u201creal life\u201d often doesn\u2019t allow time or space for. \u00a0A few weeks ago, I said something to Andrew in counseling that I\u2019d said several times before \u2013 but this time, he finally made it clear that what I\u2019d said was hurting him. \u00a0What I\u2019d said was that he was at something of a disadvantage in passing as male, because, as a girl, he was quite pretty \u2013 and that gave him an obstacle to overcome in looking masculine. \u00a0Andrew shared with me that when I said things like that, he felt as though I was saying I had lost something \u2013 that I had lost my \u201cpretty daughter\u201d\u2026 and clearly, it hurt him to feel that who he truly was inside \u2013 and now, outside was something \u201cless\u201d to me. I was very sad to know that my observation about \u201cwhat he used to be\u201d caused him to feel I had lost something along the way. \u00a0The truth is so entirely opposite \u2013 for me it has been \u201canti-loss\u201d \u2013 ONLY gain \u2013 as I have seen my child stand up and speak his truth and claim his real life \u2013 against all odds, despite peer pressure, despite fear of ridicule, in the face of the certainty that his road ahead would be so very hard. \u00a0I told him then\u2026 and I will remind him often\u2026 that he is so very much *more* than I ever could have hoped for in a child, in a son, in a young man who I am so entirely proud to have in my life. What was it again? \u00a0What did I wish for\u2026 back in those days before his mother and I knew his eye color or his name? \u00a0What was it that we had hoped for, above all? \u00a0I had wished for a child who would be able to grow up happy and strong\u2026 who would face difficult challenges with integrity and intelligence\u2026 who would know himself deeply \u00a0\u2013 and from that knowledge, live a life filled with love and joy and passions-abounding. \u00a0In my lovely son, I have found examples of all those things that I, myself, can only hope to aspire to. \u00a0His process of becoming himself is such an incredible honor to participate in and I hope, as he grows into the amazing man I know he will be, that he always knows that his parents accept him and love him deeply and completely. There is nothing here but gain.\u201d Thank you, Peter, for your beautiful words and sharing your perspective. Thank you also to Andrew for letting me share part of your story.", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
