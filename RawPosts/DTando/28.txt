I couldn\u2019t get my hands on an official document or website that outlines these changes, but I have been speaking with a couple of Kaiser representatives who have been answering my questions about the latest developments re: Kaiser and surgeries/treatments for transgender individuals. Part of this comes from an internal Kaiser document, so I did not post it in its entirety. If you have questions about \u00a0your specific Kaiser plan, the best thing to do is call member services at 800-464-4000. Here are the main points:  The transgender benefit includes sexual reassignment surgery and mastectomy/chest reconstruction services, in addition to behavioral health and hormone therapy services.\u00a0  hysterectomies/oophorectomies are included as covered procedures in \u201cbottom surgeries\u201d for FTM individuals. If a hysterectomy is medically necessary for other reasons, surgery is covered no questions asked. If this surgery is pursued as it relates to gender transition, the surgery has to be reviewed by the \u201ctransgender surgical review board process\u201d.  MTF breast augmentation is not a covered benefit Cost sharing for these services is the same as cost sharing for other medical services for the employer group or individual\u2019s plan (e.g., inpatient hospital cost share, office visit cost share, etc.). The benefit has no lifetime dollar cap on services, even for employer groups that previously purchased KP\u2019s optional transgender surgery rider that included a lifetime dollar cap.   What other KP lines of business include transgender benefits?  Medi-Cal KPIC insured plans, based on regulations issued by the CA Dept of Insurance (KPIC is currently determining the scope of transgender benefits required under the regulations) Benefits in these plans are not affected by the DMHC April 9 directive.  Which plans and market segments are not in scope for transgender benefits at this time?  FEHB Medicare (except for Group KPSA (Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage) plans in instances where the employer group has purchased optional coverage for transgender services) Self-Funded employer groups (except for self-funded groups that have specifically elected to cover transgender services)  What travel and lodging is covered as part of the transgender benefits? The travel and lodging is covered for:  \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NCAL members traveling to Arizona \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SCAL members traveling to either Arizona or San Francisco  Are other states taking similar action?  Yes.\u00a0 Regulators in Colorado, Oregon and the District of Columbia have taken similar action as in California.\u00a0 No determinations have been made in those regions yet in terms of immediate action steps or changes to practice.\u00a0 Other states may take similar or different action in the future.

Call them! Ask them how their policies have changed and what procedures are now covered. Please, let me know what you find out at tandotherapy@me.com. Update 8/1/13: Matt Wood of the Transgender Law Center offers further explanation and clarification: Kaiser is an insurer, and as such it offers a variety of plans.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to help people understand the difference between a plan and an insurer.\u00a0 In the past, certain plans included care for SRS, and certain ones didn\u2019t.\u00a0 So people used to call me and ask if they should insure themselves with Kaiser or Blue Cross, because they heard Kaiser offered trans care. The truth of the matter was that all insurers offered all care \u2013 it just depended upon what plan you or your employer contracted for.\u00a0 We have argued all along the while exclusions themselves weren\u2019t unlawful, those based upon gender identity were. The problem was that Kaiser and other insurers had exclusions that were worded as if they solely applied to trans people (\u201cno care related to transsexualism\u201d) as opposed to exclusions based upon procedures (\u201cno hysterectomies\u201d). As a result, the DMHC issued its letter saying that all medical care that is medically necessary for gender transition and that is available to non-trans people cannot be excluded. There\u2019s no distinction between MTF and FTM care, or bottom and top surgery. All *could*\u00a0be covered, depending upon a person\u2019s unique medical circumstances.\u00a0 But we\u2019re hearing right now that they don\u2019t want to do any trans related surgeries for people with plans that formerly had exclusions until they have received more information from DMHC. We\u2019re not sure why this is. We expect to get more clarification within 6 months, but that is a huge burden for many people with HMOs, not just Kaiser. Medi-cal is different.\u00a0 Medi-cal is a federal program administered by states at the county level. Medi-Cal has never excluded transition-related care (top, bottom surgery or HRT). However, depending upon which provider the county contracted with, that provider might have been misinformed and told a person there was an exclusion.\u00a0 Some people have Medi-Cal through HMOs. Some have it through fee for service (find their own doctor who accepts and get reimbursed). \u00a0The affordable care act will make it more likely that people will have HMOs.\u00a0 Some counties contract with Kaiser (esp here in the Bay Area). But other counties don\u2019t.\u00a0 But Exclusions don\u2019t now, and haven\u2019t in the past, been a legal barrier to care. Barriers have been ignorance of providers and lack of available providers (those that accept medi-cal reimbursement rates, which are supposedly among the lowest in the nation). The Director\u2019s letter applies to *all* HMOs, not just to Kaiser, as well as to all plans \u2013 including those offered by employers and schools, as well as those purchased by individuals. The only exception is that it does not apply to HMO plans that are offered by companies that are to \u201cself-insured.\u201d Many large companies are self insured, so check your plan carefully. If your company is self-insured and offers an HMO plan, it is not subject to the Director\u2019s letter. What this means: 1) An HMO cannot deny to a transgender patient the same medical procedure it covers for a non-transgender person. So if an HMO will cover a non-trans person\u2019s hormone therapy for some medical reason, it must cover hormone therapy related to gender transitions for trans people. Similarly, if an HMO offers genital surgery to a non-trans person for some reason, it cannot deny it to a transgender person who seeks it as part of their treatment for gender dysphoria/GID. 2) HMOs are not required to cover all types of transition-related care. Rather, they are required treat trans and non-trans people the same in the provision of covered care. So, for example, if an HMO does not provide coverage for a hysterectomy for a non-trans woman, then it does not have to provide coverage for a hysterectomy for a transman based upon his gender transition. 3) HMOs offer \u201cmanaged care\u201d and a primary way they save costs is by contracting with specific physicians and surgeons. These medical professionals then become part of the HMO\u2019s \u201cnetwork.\u201d As a result, if the HMO already has someone in network who can perform top surgery or GRS, then you must use that in-network provider. If you want to go to a specific surgeon that you choose, ask them first if they are part of the HMO\u2019s network. If they are not and you still want to go to them, you\u2019ll have to pay for the procedure out-of-pocket. In some rare cases, as deemed appropriate by the HMO and based upon a person\u2019s unique medical circumstances, the HMO may choose to cover medical care by a provider who is not in its network. 4) Finally, there is still much confusion about what the Director\u2019s letter means, and we are aware of transpeople who are still being denied covered care by HMOs.
