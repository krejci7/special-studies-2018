The expectant couple had the ultrasound technician find out the sex of the baby, write it on a card, and the couple didn\u2019t peek at it. (Now that\u2019s self-control!) They gave the card to a bakery, and a special cake was made based on what the card read.\u00a0 At the \u201cGender Revealing\u201d party, when they cut it open, a pink or a blue cake was discovered, thereby revealing the \u201cgender\u201d of the baby to be. My response? \u201cI went to a party like that! Except they called it a \u2018Sex Party\u2019, which is what it was\u2026 they were revealing the sex of the baby, not the gender.\u00a0 The true gender won\u2019t be revealed until the baby is much older.\u201d The blank stares I was met with weren\u2019t surprising. So few people ever think of the distinction between gender and sex, but due to my work and experiences with loved ones, I understand how important this distinction is. Do I need to be educator at every turn, or explain the distinction any time someone mentions something like this? Probably not. But, the reason I do it is this: the more people in society who understand the distinction between sex and gender, the better off gender nonconforming people will be. To be perfectly clear\u2026 sex refers to genitals and sex organs; either male or female genitals/sex organs make one biologically male or female.\u00a0 One\u2019s gender identity comes from the brain, and may or may not align with one\u2019s sex.\u00a0 I believe gender identity is something that is formed in the womb along with the genitalia; sometimes they just don\u2019t match. Gender is in reference to what a person feels like as a result of having a male or female brain.\u00a0 If one identifies as having a male gender, he is most likely going to be comfortable with being called a male name, having male pronouns used for him, and will want to present as male. If one identifies as having a female brain or gender identity, she is going to want to be referred to by a female name, female pronouns, and will want to present as female.\u00a0 Often I simplify this so-not-simple concept with this question: \u201cWhen you check out at the grocery store, do you want someone to say \u2018Thank you, Ma\u2019am\u2019, or \u2018Thank you, Sir\u201d?\u00a0 I say this because it relates it to an everyday experience which we all can relate to. It just wouldn\u2019t feel right to ANY of us if someone addressed us with the \u201cwrong\u201d title. In these everyday experiences, sex organs don\u2019t matter, but brains certainly do. And yet transgender individuals have to deal with being referred to by the \u201cwrong\u201d gender (due to their sex) often for years before transitioning. So when a baby is born and the parents hear, \u201cIt\u2019s a boy!\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s a girl!\u201d, that is a statement of what sex the baby is. One\u2019s true gender (may match the sex, or may not) is revealed much later when the individual becomes old enough or aware enough to express the gender identity of his or her brain.", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
