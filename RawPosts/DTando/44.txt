I don\u2019t know what the common denominator is in those who \u201cget it\u201d, or those who don\u2019t, I just know there is a pretty clear delineation of these two camps. I also know that there is one thing that set me up well to go into this particular niche\u2026 I just \u201cget it\u201d. I don\u2019t think that makes me better than people who don\u2019t get it; there is no judgment there. I see it as a piece that is simply a part of some people, and not a part of others. For me, I \u201cgot it\u201d first and then was educated on all the intricacies of gender identity and work with gender dysphoric individuals. Others, I suppose, may need to be educated first before they \u201cget it\u201d. The great news is that even those who initially don\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d can come to understand and accept over time. Others still may never really understand, but can be loving and accepting about it anyway. There are a lot of factors that impact how others receive the news that a loved one is transgender. One of the biggest obstacles is a lack of knowledge. Many people have never had any experience with knowing someone who is transgender and simply don\u2019t know anything about it. When there is a void of knowledge, a plethora of opinions, guesses, and myths can take its place, all of which can contribute to a difficult response or a difficult processing of the news. Many people have misconceptions and pre-conceived notions. Some have heard misinformation about transgender people; others have heard a little true information and then \u201cfilled in the blanks\u201d with assumptions that may be fueled by fear or stigma. Having certain feelings about the issue can also fuel the guesses.\u00a0 Having pre-existing negative feelings about transgender people will breed negative guesses, taking the place of fact or reality. Add worry and concern for the loved one who is transgender, and the result is a pretty tricky response to the to the big revelation. If you are a transgender individual who is \u201ccoming out\u201d to someone you care very much about and you value the relationship with this person, it is a good idea to provide information from the start or steer them in the right direction of where to find information. There are a lot of resources out there for loved ones. \u00a0Additionally, taking the time to explain your journey to self-realization of your true gender identity, and all the feelings (both positive and negative) that went with it may be just the information another needs to \u201cget it\u201d. You may feel exhausted and depleted by having already gone through a long and difficult internal journey to get to where you are, but taking the time to share this with your loved ones could go a long way. Yet even when information is provided, many still do not \u201cget it\u201d. Some simply cannot wrap their brains around the concept. There\u2019s a difference between having information/knowledge and \u201cgetting it\u201d. \u201cGetting it\u201d takes some ability to see the gray area about things, and understand that gender is not black and white. Some people have difficulty seeing things in anything other than black and white. There could also be a variety of other things that contributes to one\u2019s ability to \u201cget it\u201d. Personal experience, background, basic tolerance for those who are different, religion, empathy, the ability to see life from another\u2019s point of view, etc.\u00a0 Some are stuck in their own experiences, some are stuck in the gender dichotomy, some can only see what is concrete. How much energy should be put into trying to make them \u201cget it\u201d? After making a reasonable effort to explain yourself or the basic concept of being transgender, providing resources, etc., there is a necessary boundary that needs to be set. Doing this too much can be depleting for the trans person who has multiple other demands in which to put their energy.\u00a0 It\u2019s also important to allow others the space to come around on their own, (you have likely been down a similar journey of doubt, fear, and eventually acceptance) and accept the possibility that it may not happen.\u00a0 In those cases where your loved one doesn\u2019t seem to understand after a lot of explaining and resources given, tell them you love them ask for what you would like from them in regards to your transition. If they love you, operating from a stance of love and compassion can go a long way even if one doesn\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d. \u00a0 I\u2019ve been contemplating what the ratio of \u201cget its\u201d to \u201cdon\u2019t get its\u201d might be\u2026 To transgender individuals out there: what ratio of people in your life \u201cget it\u201d vs. those who don\u2019t?", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
