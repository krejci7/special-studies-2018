Misc About Me 
Honestly it was quite the honor to be nominated, but I am thrilled to announce this gender blog won “Best Single Topic Blog” for the 2013 National Association of Social Workers Media Awards! Thank you to everyone who voted, and to those of you who read and enjoy this blog. I am intensely passionate about this topic, and hope this blog helps educate, advocate, and raise awareness about this issue.
