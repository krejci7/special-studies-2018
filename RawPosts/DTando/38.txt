As stated in the aforementioned blog, many people ask about surgery the first time they hear about a transgender individual\u2019s plans to transition. It may surprise many people to find out the transgender individual has no plans to pursue surgery, specifically genital surgery. I recently watched a documentary called \u201cDiagnosing Difference\u201d by Annalise Ophelian (excellent; I highly recommend it!).\u00a0 This quote from that documentary summarizes perfectly what I was trying to say in my last blog, and leads nicely into what I\u2019m going to explain in this blog. \u201cThere\u2019s this huge stereotype that trans people all have genital surgery, that we know that someone\u2019s really the new gender because they\u2019ve had genital surgery, and that\u2019s one of the biggest misconceptions about trans people. In reality, the vast majority of trans people will never have any surgery, and many trans people have surgeries that aren\u2019t genital surgeries. [Italics added.]\u00a0 And some people don\u2019t have surgeries and don\u2019t undergo medical care related to their gender because they don\u2019t want it, it\u2019s not appropriate to them, there\u2019s other ways that they\u2019re expressing their gender, and some people don\u2019t have it because it\u2019s not available to them, it\u2019s not covered by their insurance\u2026and so for both of those reasons, rules that govern are you really trans or have you really transitioned based on genital status or surgical status are very damaging to trans people\u2019s well-being.\u201d \u2013Dean Spade Hormone Therapy OK, so before I get to surgery, let me talk a little bit about hormone therapy, or hormone treatment. Hormones are often a huge part of the physical transition process. Female-to-male (FTM) transgender individuals take Testosterone or \u201cT\u201d (by patch, cream, or injection, most commonly injection). Doses vary depending on the individual and his desire for physical outcomes. Often the first changes that occur from taking Testosterone are the deepening of the voice and facial hair. These are also two irreversible changes that occur from taking T. Other changes include changes in facial features, head shape, clitoral enlargement, and fat redistribution (less on hips/butt/thighs, more to stomach). For more information regarding FTM hormone therapy, visit http://transhealth.vch.ca/resources/library/tcpdocs/consumer/hormones-FTM.pdf or http://www.ohio.edu/lgbt/resources/transoptions.cfm. Male-to-Female (MTF) individuals often take Estrogen, which can be administered orally or by injection, most commonly in a pill form taken orally. Hormone therapy for MTF individuals also often includes an anti-androgen, which blocks the effects of testosterone.\u00a0 Results from taking Estrogen include but are not limited to: breast growth, softening of the skin and facial features, lessening of body hair, and changes in fat distribution (less on abdomen, more to hips and bottom). For more information about MTF hormone therapy, visit http://transhealth.vch.ca/resources/library/tcpdocs/consumer/hormones-MTF.pdf, http://www.transgendercare.com/medical/resources/tmf_program/tmf_program_6.asp, or http://www.ohio.edu/lgbt/resources/transoptions.cfm. Female-to-Male Surgical Options FTM individuals have the option of two types of surgery, commonly referred to as \u201ctop surgery\u201d and \u201cbottom surgery\u201d. Top surgery refers to the removal of breasts, the shaping of a male chest, and re-sizing the nipples. In my experience, this is the most commonly pursued and desired surgery for the FTM individual. A main reason for this is that the removal of breasts eliminates the need to bind (http://www.ftmguide.org/binding.html) and also helps the individual \u201cpass\u201d as male. Many (if not most) FTM individuals pursue this surgery, and those who don\u2019t often cite the obstacle of not having the finances for it. Top surgery commonly costs between $6-10k, out of pocket. \u00a0For more information re: FTM \u201ctop surgery\u201d, please visit:\u00a0http://www.ftmguide.org/chest.html. As for \u201cbottom surgery\u201d (surgery to construct a penis), most FTM individuals do not pursue any genital reconstruction surgery (GRS). You read that right, most DON\u2019T.\u00a0 Finances are often a major obstacle; GRS costs anywhere from $20k to $70k, depending on the procedure. \u00a0Additionally, many FTM individuals are not happy with the options/projected results; techniques have not been perfected enough to deliver optimal results. Additionally, some FTM individuals don\u2019t have a problem with their genitalia or see the need to have it changed. (Remember, one\u2019s genitalia has more to do with one\u2019s anatomy than gender. For a refresher on the difference between Gender and Sex, visit my blog Gender Vs. Sex.) For those who do pursue \u201cbottom surgery\u201d, there are a few options. These include but are not limited to: a metoidioplasty, which involves cutting the ligament connecting the (now enlarged, thanks to T) clitoris and removing extra skin, resulting in a small phallus. The urinary tract can also be lengthened if the individual wants to be able to urinate while standing. Another surgery called a \u201cphalloplasty\u201d is basically the creation of a penis using skin from a donor site on the individual\u2019s body, most commonly the forearm.\u00a0 If the trans man desires testicles, the skin from the labia can be used to create a scrotum. At least six months after a phalloplasty, testicular and penile implants can be inserted. \u00a0To quote Hudson\u2019s FTM Resource Guide, \u201cPhalloplasty usually involves a urethral lengthening procedure so that the patient can urinate through the penis. Erections are usually achieved with either a malleable rod implanted permanently or inserted temporarily in the penis, or with an implanted pump device.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0For more information regarding GRS for FTM individuals, please visit http://www.ftmguide.org/grs.html or\u00a0http://www.savaperovic.com/ftm-srs-metoidioplasty-total-phalloplasty.htm. There are MANY different options for FTM individuals who don\u2019t choose to or who can\u2019t afford bottom surgery. There are all sorts of accoutrements available for purchase that allow the trans man to stand to urinate, wear a penis, and/or to have intercourse. In order to stand to urinate, there are \u201cstand to pee\u201d (STP) devices. (http://www.ftmguide.org/packing.html#stp)\u00a0 If the trans man prefers to wear a penis, full-time if desired, this is called \u201cpacking\u201d. (http://www.ftmguide.org/packing.html)\u00a0There are a variety of different packers available for purchase.\u00a0\u00a0(http://www.tranzwear.net/store.php?seller=TranZwear&navt1=101317&navt2=101323.\u00a0For a 15% discount on purchases from tranzwear.com, use discount code \u201cTRANZ\u201d when checking out.)\u00a0 For sexual intercourse, there are also a variety of options to choose from (http://www.ftmguide.org/packinghard.html).\u00a0 I should add here that not all trans men choose to pack or wear any kind of prosthesis. As with any group of individuals, there is a spectrum of preferences about this! Male-to-Female Surgical Options Facial feminization is a common surgery pursued by MTF individuals. This can include changing the hairline, frontal bone contouring, mandible contouring, chin augmentation or reduction, rhinoplasty, lip augmentation, etc. I don\u2019t know the exact numbers on this, but the cost of this surgery can be upwards of $30k. For more information on facial feminization, visit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_feminization_surgery. Some trans women opt to undergo breast augmentation surgery. (Estrogen often does not enlarge one\u2019s breasts to more than a \u201cB\u201d cup.) http://marcibowers.com/grs/breastaug.html As for MTF \u201cbottom surgery\u201d, often referred to as Sexual Reassignment Surgery (SRS) or Genital Reconstruction Surgery (GRS), many transgender women opt to undergo a vaginoplasty, using skin and tissue from the penis to create a vagina, clitoris, clitoral hood and labia.\u00a0 This is another expensive surgery not covered by insurance; I don\u2019t know the exact figures but what I could find implied a ballpark figure of $20k. Sue Boyd, LCSW, a trusted colleague of mine who works with more MTF individuals than I do, estimates that about half of her MTF clients opt to pursue this surgery \u201cexpense and all\u201d. My guess is because the results are more satisfactory to the consumer than the current results of FTM bottom surgery. For more information on MTF GRS, please visit:\u00a0http://www.thetransgendercenter.com/transgendersurgerymaletofemaleMTF.html or\u00a0http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery_(male-to-female)#Genital_surgery. I should say again that all of the above depends on personal preference. Some individuals believe opting to get any or all of the above surgeries is a way of buying into the gender stereotypes prescribed by society, particularly about how a man or woman \u201cshould\u201d look. To quote the film \u201cDiagnosing Difference\u201d again, \u201cI think \u2018passing\u2019 is a word to discriminate us immensely. Not everybody can pass. And passing is something that the doctors will tell you to do, you try to pass. Well, no matter how much I pass, I will never be a biological woman. How about empowering me as the transgender woman that I am?\u201d -Adela Vazquez A moment on my soap box: After reading all these extensive options a transgender individual confronts, don\u2019t you wish things could be a little bit easier? They can be. By intervening EARLY with a child or pre-adolescent who has yet to start puberty, their future does not have to hold as many medical interventions! For the MTF individual, staring on hormone blockers pre-puberty would prevent facial hair from growing in, thereby preventing HOURS of painful and expensive electrolysis. Hormone blockers would also prevent one\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple from growing and the voice from deepening, which would eliminate the need for a \u201ctrach shave\u201d\u2026 ouch! Similarly, staring hormone blockers pre-puberty for the FTM individual would prevent breast growth and ultimately prevent an expensive and painful \u201ctop surgery\u201d. Additionally, for the transgender individual who desires to \u201cpass\u201d as their true gender, intervening early gives them the best chance at doing exactly that.
