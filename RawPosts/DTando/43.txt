I haven\u2019t said what it is exactly I\u2019d like others to \u201cget\u201d. I have been referring people to my blog as a means of helping them understand all the various aspects of gender identity, transitioning, etc. but I haven\u2019t thoroughly explained IT, meaning what it means to be transgender. Am I qualified for explaining this one? I\u2019m not transgender myself, nor could I even be considered gender variant. So is it presumptuous of me to take this one on? Does witnessing and listening to the intimate desires, dreams, emotions, trials, and tribulations of many transgender individuals qualify me for defining \u201cit\u201d? Maybe. In fact, that more explains why this blog has been primarily about the inner angst and the external pressures of the transperson; this is what I work with every day, not defining \u201cit\u201d. Likely because I get it, my clients get it, and we need to work out all the other details. So, details aside, this blog is about IT. I\u2019m not going to define \u201cit\u201d or give a clinical explanation (I might do that at a later time.) I\u2019m going to share some thoughts (in my own words), based on my relationships with many transgender individuals who have allowed me to take a glimpse into their hearts and souls. To those of you who are transgender, I hope I did you justice. To those of you who are the \u201cothers\u201d seeking to understand, put on your empathy hats. Let\u2019s go! IT: It\u2019s being a person faced with a remarkable challenge. It\u2019s being a person, with feelings, thoughts, and aspirations that are affected by and often times overshadowed by the feelings of gender incongruity. It\u2019s being a \u201cnormal\u201d person, with a set of abnormal circumstances to navigate. It\u2019s being a child who desperately wants to play with a kind of toy or a group of kids and is told wanting such things is wrong. It\u2019s keeping the biggest part of yourself secret, often for years upon years. It\u2019s life\u2019s earliest lesson that others are not always going to accept you exactly as you are. It\u2019s honoring yourself. It\u2019s having a body that feels foreign to you at times. It\u2019s feeling betrayed by puberty rather than excited by it. It\u2019s fear that being true to yourself will make you lose those most important to you. It\u2019s anxiety about making a \u201cdecision\u201d, when in your gut you know it\u2019s not a decision, but something you have to do for yourself. It\u2019s a fear of losing a deeply loved partner as a result of transitioning. It\u2019s sacrificing a lot to gain a lot. It\u2019s a feeling of not feeling comfortable with the pronouns people use for you, but sometimes not knowing why. It\u2019s huge relief when you finally figure out WHY. It\u2019s facing a bigger challenge than most people do in their lifetimes. It\u2019s holding your bladder for hours at a time to avoid using a restroom in public; either room could cause problems for you prior to transitioning. It\u2019s being incredibly brave. It\u2019s being careful of your loved ones\u2019 feelings while hoping they are careful with yours. It\u2019s not knowing how you fit in around those who share your gender. It\u2019s a decision to be stealth or be \u201cout\u201d. It\u2019s being a child who clearly knows his or her gender, and hoping a parent helps. It\u2019s coming out as \u201cgay\u201d, even when that doesn\u2019t feel right, because it\u2019s the only way you know at the time to make others understand why you are attracted to who you are attracted to. It\u2019s knowing exactly who you are, and wishing others did too.\u00a0 It\u2019s anxiety that even after changing you won\u2019t be truly happy. It\u2019s trusting yourself even in the midst of all the other voices. It\u2019s fear of taking a hormone, even when you know that hormone is the only thing that can help you become who you really want to be. It\u2019s gratitude for medical interventions. It\u2019s finding where you land along the gender spectrum. It\u2019s being teased for being who you are. It\u2019s wishing things were different. It\u2019s dread of changes, impatience for changes, and desperation for changes, all at the same time. It\u2019s having to jump through hoops to get the interventions needed when what you need isn\u2019t pathological. It\u2019s fear (often projected) of transitioning too young. It\u2019s sadness about transitioning too old. It\u2019s understanding that others like gender to be black and white, and to make sense, and sometimes you don\u2019t make sense to them. It\u2019s feeling trapped. It\u2019s feeling freed. It\u2019s feeling your stomach do a flip the first of many times you hear a loved one use the \u201cright\u201d pronoun. It\u2019s wishing others knew how hard this is for YOU. It\u2019s making the impossible possible. It\u2019s hours of research on the Internet. It\u2019s absorbing the stories of those who have gone before you to make things seem less overwhelming. It\u2019s a beautiful transformation.\u00a0 It\u2019s naming yourself. It\u2019s a feeling of being \u201cripped off\u201d, even when you don\u2019t know who or what to blame. It\u2019s having all the pieces of the puzzle finally make sense. It\u2019s me wishing this was easier for you. It\u2019s regret for moving too slowly, fear of moving too fast. It\u2019s bitterness about the money it takes to change your body to align with your mind, when most can save for luxuries.\u00a0 It\u2019s compassion for yourself and all you are going through, when no one else around you can give it. It\u2019s wanting concrete answers to an abstract concept. It\u2019s thinking \u201cam I crazy?\u201d when you know you\u2019re sane. It\u2019s your heart racing every time you have to \u201ccome out\u201d. It\u2019s wishing you could \u201cjust be happy\u201d in your assigned gender. It\u2019s standing on the edge of a cliff, getting ready to jump and hoping you will fly. It\u2019s skepticism that this will really work out. It\u2019s incredible relief to finally be seen as WHO YOU ARE. It\u2019s a feeling of inadequacy, even when those of us around you can see you are more than adequate just the way you are. It\u2019s joy in being true to yourself. It\u2019s relief in finding others like you, or others who understand you. It\u2019s listening to your inner voice, possibly one you\u2019ve been ignoring for a long time. It\u2019s finally having the need to be YOU outweigh the fear. It\u2019s excitement. It\u2019s empowerment. It\u2019s confusion. It\u2019s happiness. It\u2019s thankfulness. It\u2019s pride. It\u2019s hope. It\u2019s relief. That is IT. *** What does IT mean to you?", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
