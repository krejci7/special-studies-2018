Language and knowledge is always evolving, therefore so should my gender worksheets!  I never liked that my previous worksheets said “girl bodies” and “boy bodies”, so I found a way around that. I also found a way to expand the concepts of gender, while hoping to keep it as simple as possible for the little ones. Please feel free to utilize this with your child or in your practice! The best way to do it is to read over the information at the top without pausing or looking at the child. Then, when it’s time to “fill in the blanks”, poise your pen over the answers and wait to hear the child say them. Try your best not to look at them or have a reaction. This helps avoid “leading” them in any way or have them change their answers based on your response. I hope many of you find this helpful! Feedback welcome! newworksheet2017
