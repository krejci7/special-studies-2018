Here\u2019s how it all went down: In early 2006 I was establishing my private practice while I was still working at the Naval Medical Center San Diego. As a way of getting new clients, I advertised on Craigslist. I was a little leery of doing this, for fear it would attract people not exactly looking for therapy. True, I got a couple of off-color inquiries, but thankfully these were easy to screen as not legitimate. Since I had never before worked with gender nonconforming clients, my ad said nothing about that. Here is a snippet from that ad: \u201cAlthough I specialize in working with children, I also work with adult individuals and couples. I find that my warm and empathetic approach that works so well with children also helps to create a safe, therapeutic environment for adults which promotes progress in therapy.\u201d Perhaps it was the way the ad was phrased that made someone struggling with their true identity reach out to me? \u201cHello, I was wondering if you offer any type of therapy that deals with gender reassignment[\u2026] If you don\u2019t, and happen to know of someone please send me their name. Thanks.\u201d Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have the response I wrote back to him, but this is the return email: \u201cDarlene, Thank you so much for responding to my message. You are right it was a hard step as it will be the first talking contact for me. I appreciate your honesty in telling me that you have not worked with any transgendered [sic] patients. Doesn\u2019t bother me one bit. In all honesty, I feel like I know where I am at as far as how I feel about the situation. Where I am having my biggest doubts and fears are when it comes to telling my family and friends about my issue/feelings. The fear of their reactions is kind of holding me back. [\u2026] For some reason I feel like we can work together, and you can help me a lot. [\u2026] I have a few other questions regarding my letter for T, and top surgery, but I\u2019m sure we can discuss these at a later time. Which name would you like? My birth name or what I plan (at this moment) to go by? Thank you.\u201d I don\u2019t have my response but I do know it included this question: \u201cWhat is T?\u201d. This always makes me smile thinking back to it. \u201cT\u201d, referencing Testosterone, is now a standard (almost daily!) part of my vocabulary. I also know that even though I hadn\u2019t been \u201ctrained\u201d yet in gender therapy, I knew to of course ask for his preferred name. That is the name I have called him ever since, and have never once called him his birth name. There are SO many things I had to learn after I started working with him and soon thereafter many more transgender individuals. However, the concept of being transgender never confused or fascinated me. It just seemed so simple, pursuing alignment to match one\u2019s gender identity. As I\u2019ve said before, some people \u201cget it\u201d\u00a0and some people don\u2019t. I got it. Our first session focused on a psychosocial assessment and discussing his goals for gender transition. He needed to educate me about some things, but I also made it clear I would be doing research and pursuing my own education about this. I knew that just because he was my first transgender client it wasn\u2019t his job to teach me everything I needed to know in order to give him the best care. He left me with his copy of \u201cTestosterone Files\u201d by Max Valerio which I promptly read. After all the books I\u2019ve read on this topic, I\u2019m always glad that was my first. I felt it was a very informative and well-written account of someone transitioning from female to male. Here is part of the email I received after our first session: \u201cHey Darlene, I just wanted to say\u00a0thank you for taking time out\u00a0to talk with me today. I admit\u00a0I\u00a0was really nervous before we started, but I ended up more comfortable\u00a0than I thought I was going to be. I also want you to know that you are very easy to talk to, and I believe you are going to be able to help me figure out what I\u00a0need to do. I actually left your place with a feeling of relief for the first time. Somehow I feel as if things are going to be all right eventually for me. Thanks. Looking forward to our next session!\u201d This client was traveling quite\u00a0a way to\u00a0see me, which was my first clue there were not a plethora of other therapists working with this population. He connected me with his case manager from the former S.T.A.R. program, \u201cSupporting Transgender Access to Resources\u201d. The care manager reiterated the lack of therapists for this community and was soon sending me MANY more transgender clients. I did my best to get equipped for the details of my newfound duties; writing letters for hormone treatment and surgery, helping clients access resources, assisting them in the coming out and transitioning process. I read books, attended conferences, and attended monthly\u00a0FTMI\u00a0(Female to Male International) meetings at the\u00a0LGBT\u00a0Center here in San Diego. Soon I was leading a weekly support group for\u00a0FTM\u00a0individuals in addition to the clients I was seeing one-on-one. I am so grateful to all the people and clients I interacted with during that time; I learned so much from them and became more committed to and invested in my work than ever. At first my gender therapy was only with adult clients. Soon, my name was \u201cout there\u201d and I began seeing gender nonconforming and transgender children. Since my specialty had always been working with children and my newfound specialty was gender therapy, this was a beautiful and serendipitous melding of the two. When I first found out about the\u00a0substantial\u00a0lack of gender therapists in San Diego, I didn\u2019t understand why. Why weren\u2019t there more if the need was so high? Was there something I was missing? Was I looking at this too simply, that these people coming to me knew their true gender and just needed some help getting there? Over 8 years later, I can answer: no, I wasn\u2019t missing anything. This work truly is that cut and\u00a0dry;\u00a0the clients are the experts on their own gender identity. I am just here to help and support them along the journey. My first client has told me many times how I \u201cchanged his life\u201d, but I can honestly say he changed mine in much the same way. He gave me a specialty that I am deeply passionate about; I am absolutely inspired and energized by my work. In an amazing \u201cparallel universe\u201d kind of way, entering into this particular niche has helped someone very significant to me discover their true gender identity and therefore\u00a0transition. Because of this, gender transition is a part of both my professional and personal life, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. To my \u201cOG\u201d client: THANK YOU. Thank you for giving me a chance. For trusting me with such a huge undertaking in your life even though I had no \u201cexperience\u201d. Thank you for blessing me with this amazing work I get to do. And, thank you for letting me share part of your emails here.", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
