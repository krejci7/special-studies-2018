You were born with fully functioning lungs that have delivered oxygen to your blood and brain, just as they are supposed to. You can\u2019t imagine it any other way, simply because it\u2019s never been any other way for you. You\u2019ve also not given much thought to the role oxygen plays in your life, because it\u2019s always been there, as much as you need, delivered to you on cue, no questions asked.\u00a0 For anyone who\u2019s briefly experienced a decrease in oxygen, or lack of oxygen, that person will likely never forget the feeling of panic and the intense, primal need to have oxygen fill the lungs once again. Take a nice, deep breath. Let the air expand your lungs and your stomach.\u00a0 Feels good, doesn\u2019t it? Ah, oxygen. What would you do without it? Well, you\u2019d die, is the obvious answer.\u00a0 What if you had enough of it to survive, but just not quite enough to lead a \u201cnormal\u201d life? Picture this: You were born with something wrong with your lungs, so that they couldn\u2019t fully absorb and process oxygen the way most people\u2019s lungs can. You can take in just enough oxygen to live, but not fully engage in life. Since you were born with your lungs not doing precisely what they should do, you spend every day of your life not being able to do all the things you would otherwise like to do. You spend many of your days wishing your lungs were different, wishing you could breathe as fully and deeply as everyone around you. You watch everyone take those deep, life-sustaining breaths, and you can tell none of them realize how lucky they are; their lungs (and the resulting oxygen they get) is simply taken for granted.\u00a0 You stand there, taking shallow, ragged breaths, feeling weak and somewhat listless. Then one day, you stumble across something on the internet: \u2018Sub-par Oxygenation Syndrome\u201d. (Yes, I made that up.) You discover there is a name for what you\u2019ve been experiencing, and other people have it too!\u00a0 Sadly, some have taken their own lives from not being able to tolerate the feelings associated with having this syndrome. You feel relieved, validated, excited. Then you read that there is a solution. While it may not give you new lungs, there is a machine that can deliver this life-enhancing oxygen straight to you: an oxygen tank. It\u2019s expensive (insurance doesn\u2019t cover it in this scenario), but you know you\u2019ll do anything to get access to it. The day you get your tank feels like the most liberating, exciting day of your life. You strap that baby on (it comes in a nifty backpack) and put the tubes under your nose. To breathe so fully and so easily is something you\u2019ve longed for your whole life, but never thought you\u2019d experience. (At times, you feel sad and resentful you have to wear such a contraption to feel the way most others were born feeling, but continue to be grateful nonetheless.) When you explain to those close to you what you\u2019ve discovered and show them your new tank, they\u2019re skeptical. \u201cReally? Are you sure you\u2019re not getting enough oxygen? I get plenty of oxygen every time I take a deep breath. Perhaps you\u2019re not doing it right.\u201d\u00a0 Others don\u2019t like your oxygen tank. \u201cHmmm, I liked you better before you wore that tank. I\u2019m not used to seeing you with those tubes. Can you please take it off?\u201d. You\u2019re saddened and shaken by these responses, but you don\u2019t take it off. The oxygen tank brings you too much relief and too much life to dare take it off. \u00a7 I\u2019ve been looking for some sort of concrete metaphor to use to help explain being transgender and transitioning. Concrete examples can help with understanding. However, I wanted to be careful not to compare being transgender with being disabled. I do not think it is a disability. I think it is something REAL, like not getting enough air. I hope this analogy does justice to those transgender individuals reading it and hits home with loved ones. The irony of my example is that if someone had been born with something wrong with his or her lungs, it would likely have been caught right away by medical doctors, and offered a solution early on. Gender variance is a bit trickier; a person\u2019s need for his or her gender identity to be validated develops much later than one\u2019s need for adequate oxygen. While we still have a long way to go, intervening with children who display persistent gender-variant behaviors and a consistent desire for changing genders is much like offering the oxygen tank to the person in the above scenario as a child; \u201cI know what you need; here you go.\u201d One last thought worth mentioning is that I do believe being transgender is a medical condition and belongs in the medical books, not the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). This is why comparing it to another type of medical condition was appealing to me. I\u2019ll save the rest of my thoughts on this topic for another blog.
