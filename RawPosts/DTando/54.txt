I have heard so much about her, and I was thrilled to finally get to meet her in person. Kim is an amazing woman and mother of a trans individual. She is the Executive Director and co-founder of Trans Youth Family Allies (TYFA), an organization that connects and supports families of trans children. The \u201clittle t\u201d in LGBt, as Kim would say!  Her organization plays a crucial role in advocating for and educating for this underserved population. I approached her after the talk and told her we must connect, so the next day we met up for coffee.\u00a0 It was wonderful to talk to someone who is so passionate about working with gender variant and transgender children, and completely validated my beliefs about the work I do with them. As she said at the end of our meeting, \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet like-minded people!\u201d Likewise, Kim! Thank you for all the work you do. See the link below for more information about Kim and TYFA. http://www.imatyfa.org/aboutus/bio-kimpearson.html Also, consider donating to keep this AMAZING, volunteer-based program alive. http://www.imatyfa.org/permanent_files/donate.html Stay tuned for more blogs about valuable information and insights I gained from connecting with Kim.", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
