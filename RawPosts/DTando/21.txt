Related to loved ones\u2019 fears about a transgender person being \u201csure\u201d about transitioning are the fears that they may one day regret the transition or \u201cchange their mind\u201d about being transgender. Yes, I hear this a lot. From doctors, from parents. It\u2019s a valid concern, although I\u2019m not sure the frequency with which it happens is correlated with the amount of concern about it. It seems that at first parents hope their child (either a youth or their adult child) will change their minds when a transgender identity is first revealed. Later, this thought turns into a fear as transition nears or progresses. In my opinion, some of the fear and anxiety comes from good intentions, trying to use their own perspective to understand. If they put themselves in the transgender person\u2019s shoes, they would imagine not only would they \u201cchange their minds\u201d, but they would want to \u201cswitch back\u201d immediately. It\u2019s really important to try to not use your own perspective in this situation if you have never once struggled with your gender identity. For as sure as you are about your gender identity, your transgender loved one is likely just as sure about their gender identity. But what about the studies?? Oh, the studies. The studies that scare everyone. There are plenty of studies that show gender nonconformity in childhood doesn\u2019t persist. That even those who insist they are the \u201cother\u201d gender do not go on to transition. Keep in mind some of these studies were written by doctors who were actively trying to get the child to conform to their birth gender. Additionally, all the dynamics at play with the child\u2019s gender identity are not known in those studies. Not everyone follows the same path. Not everyone has the same personality, confidence, support system, encouragement, discrimination, access to resources, parents, communities, ego strength, temperament, role models etc. All of these factors, and many more, can affect whether or not someone chooses to transition. Someone may decide that having their body be different from their affirmed gender identity is more distressing than having their birth gender identity be different from their affirmed gender identity. Everyone is different. People experience distress in different ways and because of different things. Just because someone chooses not to transition, or later \u201cde-transitions\u201d does not mean they are not transgender. It means that they (or others in their life) decided transitioning was ultimately not the best choice for them. I believe that most of the children/teens/adults who say they are \u201csure\u201d and then transition do not live to regret this decision. I have anecdotal evidence with my own clients. Don\u2019t believe me? In 2011, a man named Colin Close conducted a survey about how medically-assisted transition\u2028affects the lives of transgender people. The study examined the\u2028experiences of 448 individuals to identify the impacts transition on\u2028gender dysphoria, quality of life, emotional well-being, personality\u2028traits, and sexuality.\u2028\u2028The outcome?  94% of trans* people reported an improvement in their quality of life due to transitioning 96% answered that their sense of well-being improved 9 out of 10 responded that their overall personality improved due to transition 85% described their emotional stability as \u201cimproved\u201d (11% reported no change) 96% reported an overall satisfaction with transition 97% reported a satisfaction with hormone therapy 96% reported satisfaction with chest surgery 90% reported satisfaction with genital surgery  You can download the full report here. Are there those that do change their minds and regret transitioning? Yes, there are. I can\u2019t speak to exactly what dynamics led to this, as only they know everything that went into all of their decisions. However, I believe they deserve just as much support \u201cde-transitioning\u201d as they did transitioning. It is their gender. It is their life. It is their journey. We as humans (probably as self-protective measure) tend to look at the \u201cworst case scenarios\u201d and feel scared by risks associated with choices, no matter how small. It\u2019s natural. However, those small percentages of things often scare us from taking the leap to do something we want to do. Let me use this as an example: what if the ratio of successful airplane flights to the number of airplane crashes was roughly equivalent to the ratio of people who are satisfied about transitioning to those who regret it? If we all based our sense of safety on thinking about the small percentage of airplane crashes, none of us would want to fly again. There a risk to much everything we do, and there are no guarantees. Yet with risk often comes adventure, new possibilities, fulfillment, joy! Think of transitioning as your loved one spreading their wings to fly.  What about the kids, you say? They are not adults. How can they POSSIBLY make such a huge decision as this? Well, gender identity is not a decision. It is a way one is. For children who have shown a persistent and consistent cross-gender identification during childhood and express a strong desire to be seen as the gender with which their brain identifies, they should be allowed to do so. Transitioning is something one does about one\u2019s gender identity if it doesn\u2019t match one\u2019s body. Parents and professionals need to help youth access the resources they need to do so; that is the vehicle for supporting one\u2019s true identity, not just a \u201cbig decision\u201d. Bear with me for a moment while I expand upon the decision about marriage as a metaphor of sorts for gender transition as I did in my last blog post. I don\u2019t know what the current percentage is, but last I heard 50% of marriages end in divorce. 50%! That\u2019s HALF of the people who decide to commit themselves to someone for the rest of their lives, and essentially \u201cchange their minds\u201d. I can tell you that is FAR higher than the number of individuals who will regret their gender transition! Now, does this mean we should increase the hoops one should jump through in order to get married? Should one\u2019s mental health be evaluated before entering into marriage and signed off by a licensed therapist?Does the person who is performing the marriage have to have some sort of guarantee that this marriage will last forever before conducting the ceremony? Of course not. If both parties are entering into the marriage willingly and are able to make sound decisions for themselves, they should have every right to do so. Informed consent is the name of the game when it comes to getting married, as it should be with gender transition. Is there a chance your loved one may regret the decision? Yes. Is there a chance you may die the next time you get in your car or the next time you take an airplane flight? Yes. There are no guarantees. But I can say this: there are more risks associated with not transitioning or allowing your child to transition that there is with transition. Acknowledge your fear but don\u2019t let it hold you (or your loved one) back. Soon you\u2019ll all be ready for takeoff.", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
