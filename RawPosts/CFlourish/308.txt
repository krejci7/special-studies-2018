Or, as Hegel put it, Self-consciousness exists in itself and for itself, in that, and by the fact that it exists for another self-consciousness; that is to say, it is only by being acknowledged or \u201crecognized\u201d. Humanity is an infinite spiritual unity, and individuals are part of that unity. Do you know, really know, anyone else? Do you \u201csublate\u201d them, negating them as other individuals and assimilating them into your understanding of yourself? I have struggled through pure Hegel, and Eric Steinhart\u2019s commentary on it, not understanding. I need to know my own truth before I can judge theirs. You mentioned this, and I do not know why. Is it because in your radical feminism, man is always destined by Patriarchy to be Master, woman to be slave? Then it would be for me to do the work of knowing myself without your service; and I could never be a woman, because I had never been so enslaved. My experience is that I did not know myself because I was always looking to others to learn what I ought to be. I knew that was Manliness, which in part I learned from parents, yet I remember cack-handed attempts to fit in with my peers. (I was delighted to borrow the denim jacket, because I wanted to be \u201ccool\u201d. Dancing in it made me hot and sweaty. \u201cWell, take it off then!\u201d he said, as if that was obvious, not seeing my perplexity.) There is not enough research on us trans, but some say we have autistic-like characteristics. Which may or may not be like Asperger\u2019s, I read or heard somewhere that the theoretical links between those might be false. Onywye, if autists have \u201can inability to read the emotional signs of others\u201d (or not) they might like me have a desperation to see from others\u2019 behaviour what is normal behaviour- without being able to relate it to their own emotional states. If I\u2019m cold I need some heat If I\u2019m hungry then I eat I\u2019m not responsible sang Deep Purple, on their first reunion album in the 1980s. I know because I had that album- see what I mean about trying to be cool, or to understand? And, not? (Does anyone?) If it rains I stay inside If I\u2019m scared I run and hide moving from power to weakness. Is this more profound than I thought? It seems to me that my mother formed me to be the low status one, deferring to others, at the bottom of the pecking order. Is love, slavery? Christ was crucified, after all, power in powerlessness- If I want you as a replacement mother, to value me into existence, you will refuse. If I am hurled from \u201cwomen\u2019s space\u201d into the darkness, rather than weep and gnash my teeth I must value myself. If I depend on another\u2019s perception or valuing I will always be a slave. Does this help me see you, as paradoxical as I am? I glimpse, but when I try to make sense of it I am grasping at air. Did Hegel do any better? Do you?  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 31 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
