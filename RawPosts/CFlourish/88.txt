I asked permission to enter, and was welcomed, at least officially. For the opening session, they ask us what we want from women\u2019s space. I say I want to explore the tension between the femininity I choose to express, and the womanhood of most people here. The name \u201cRed Tent\u201d is not particularly welcoming for trans women. Of course it refers to menstruation; a woman asked if it were linked to the Red Hat, but that is separate, named from Jenny Joseph\u2019s poem. The Red Tent creates a space for us to honor our blood cycles and womanhood journeys. Yet there is no objection to me here. That could be a legal thing, I cannot think it would be a \u201cproportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim\u201d to exclude me. Others wanted to discuss The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and time is set aside. And given that reproductive physiology is such a huge part of most people\u2019s experience, it is reasonable to make it a defining matter for women\u2019s space. We hear that some men object to there being a space solely for women. Ribald catcalling ensues. We can tell them there is a Men\u2019s Journey group at 11am on Saturday, and 11pm on Sunday. Later, I saw notices up about this in the Red Tent: a feminine taking care of others\u2019 feelings, while asserting their rights. I went off to eat, and as I ate a woman sidled up to me. \u201cIt was brave of you to speak like that,\u201d she said. I don\u2019t think it brave, myself. I was participating. There is no point in being there otherwise. She said she knew someone who transitioned, and \u201che\u201d said (I am fairly clear she means AMAB) \u201che had transitioned with a small T not a capital T\u201d. I get what she means. There is no good way of asking that question, but this sidling round it is horrible. I don\u2019t answer, but don\u2019t ask if that should make a difference to the Red Tent. It\u2019s not as if we were getting undressed. We ate together, then went for a drink, and talked more. I insisted on buying my own. I would not accept a drink from her. After that, I had to go back to the Red Tent. I would not be chased away. We are in small groups discussing, and a younger woman talks of children learning of sex through porn, and sex education being solely biological, mechanical, rather than about relationships, or even about pleasure given and received. An older woman talks of being a minister, and having her leadership subtly disrespected. Where a male minister would be \u201ccharming\u201d she is read as \u201cflirtatious\u201d. She wondered about mentoring younger women in similar roles. Two black women talked of more content here to attract black people. Then all my group but me left, and I was left sitting in the middle of the floor, with everyone else round the sides. I felt a bit exposed, but fed back to the larger group what they had talked about. A minister in another group gave her take on the matter, as clearly I had not understood. -Oh, and we talked about sex. (laughter). -Did any group not talk about sex? It\u2019s evening, and getting colder, so I put on my tights, then walk out.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 9 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
