Now there is no problem. I was utterly delighted in 2003 when the Quaker Women\u2019s Group agreed that anyone who \u201cexperienced herself as a woman\u201d could attend. However, I am never again going to moan that I was told \u201cbig boys don\u2019t cry\u201d from the age of four. At least I was never told it is unfeminine, and therefore bad in me, to express anger. As I said, my mantra was, \u201cThese are ordinary decent people minding their own business\u201d. And now, I have improved it. Now it is, \u201cThese are beautiful, wonderful people, being and doing\u201d. There is no need to fear any of them. Not one. Oh, and: I used to say, \u201cEverything\u2019s gonna be alright\u201d, but that is not quite it either. \u201cEverything is alright.\u201d ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 56 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
