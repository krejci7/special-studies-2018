I notice the imperfectly shaven hair beneath the make-up. To my mind, her face, the size and shape of it, jowls and brow ridge, appear male, and the wig is wrong: its parting shows a cloth lining rather than a scalp. The clothes suit a woman of her age, but the dress sense is slightly off. And this is me, not her. How often I have looked in the mirror and thought, \u201cOh God, I look like a man!\u201d and at other times thought, well, actually, I don\u2019t look too bad; and I looked the same, it was just the way I was looking at myself. I thought of telling her- \u201cDon\u2019t do it! It isn\u2019t worth it!\u201d but what would be the point? I do not know that it is not, for her; and I really want to tell my two decades younger self, but I can\u2019t, and that younger self might not listen anyway. S/he had her heart and mind, her reality and nature, and if s/he would not listen to them s/he would not listen even if someone came back from the future. Or, perhaps, she is right and my doubts now are wrong. And this is dissatisfaction, a nameless unease rather than a clear understanding of what might be better. If that\u2019s all there is, let\u2019s break out the booze and let\u2019s keep dancing. In Tesco\u2019s, two small children, below waist height, stared up into my face and said \u201cAre you the bikey man? Are you the bikey man?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the bikey person,\u201d I said weakly. Such clarity and definiteness from two so young is depressing. Possibly the thought of defiance is the kind of illusion I would jump at in this mood. I shake my fist in the face of encroaching Night. It feels as if it might be energising. The febrile energy would be heat not light. What would I be defying? What would be better? Possibly dissatisfaction is better. I am dissatisfied. Things are not as I would wish- this is the impetus to find what might be better. I would be defying the expectations of others, or what I imagined those expectations to be. If- If that really is all there is, it is good enough, actually. I try to be a Real Man, and fail, because that is not who I am, and learn about transition. It fits me better than anything else I can imagine, so I do it. I could fit in, take a role which is almost acceptable. I could be me. Years later, I look down at that child. It would be nice not to be laughed at, not ever, but it might not be possible. Good enough: I work out how best to be me, and now am still working on that, but more precisely. Now I decide it does not fit, so create a new role. This takes a long time, but I get there. I see more clearly who I am, accept that, and can live it; less conflicted, resentful, but incrementally. Would that the work was done! After meeting I drank with H, and told her I was populating the word \u201cpansy\u201d. It means effeminate male, but has no other baggage I dislike, unlike \u201csissy\u201d. She said, so, you are identifying with masculinity? No, maleness. Definitely not masculinity. Masculinity is cultural, maleness physical. I should have asked her why she used the word. Being a soft male is OK. Being a soft male is OK. Being a soft male is OK. I don\u2019t know what defiance would look like or what I would defy. I am happy with the names I use and the way I dress. If I can admit I am a \u201cman\u201d would the pointed scrutiny of that small child have less effect? What she sees, thinks, even says is part of the world I cannot control, which does not hurt me really. In the pharmacy, I ask for \u201cPrescription for Clare, please\u201d. It makes me sound like a disease! To see it another way, I could be an elixir or universal tonic, inspiring merriment everywhere.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 13 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
