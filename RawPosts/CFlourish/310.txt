She had her black book and pen on her lap: she feared it would be politically correct pro-Transgender preaching, and was ready to note down the most objectionable and unreal (from her point of view) bits. I don\u2019t know if she wrote anything in her book, I was too engrossed in the film, and before the end she leaned her head on my shoulder. After, she said, \u201cYou know I see you as a man, don\u2019t you?\u201d Well, yes. But I find her so fascinating, beautiful, stimulating and exciting that I am willing to put up with that. What matters is that I do not doubt myself: if there is no echo of her assertion in my own mind, I can tolerate her believing it. H is not a virago or a harridan, but if those words could be stripped of their strongly pejorative connotations they might approximate to her. \u201cVirago\u201d is partially reclaimed. I sympathise: she does not fit Patriarchal views of woman any more than I fit those of man. And she is so playful! She might not like \u201ctermagant\u201d or \u201choyden\u201d- she had not liked being called a \u201ctomboy\u201d. Why should she be any kind of \u201cboy\u201d for liking what she liked? She wondered why I had gone on Quiner\u2019s Diner. \u201cIf you go there, you must at some level imagine they are right.\u201d No, I go there to inoculate myself against the falsehoods. That spoke to her: she has considered pro-pornography sites for a similar reason. \u201cI think emotionally,\u201d I told her. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me that makes you a woman, are you?\u201d she said. No. Really, really, no- I understand completely your objection to such an argument; but coming to accept this is my major personal growth point atm: I grew up not knowing my feelings, suppressing them, fearing my anger and my fear- which makes them far more painful and difficult to deal with. She understands- there are so many advantages to this friendship that a little thing like her thinking I am a man is quite tolerable. And I am never going to convince her, so what\u2019s the use of trying? I have been thinking of my niece, aged about 17, say of something, \u201cThat\u2019s Yucky!!!\u201d- at the time, I thought this a childish mode of expression, now I think, what clarity! Beautiful! This morning I had tea with Richard. \u201cShe thinks I am a man,\u201d I said, and he was horrified. He thought I must refute this, with rational argument. \u201cNo! Fuck rationality!\u201d I said, joyfully. This shocked him. You have to think rationally. Well, of course I could do rationality; but my most important thinking is emotional, and I celebrate that. I put the radical feminist argument, and he gave me five minutes to put it, and said, \u201cYou forget, don\u2019t you, that I am a social scientist?\u201d He told me of differing styles of playing, relating, being between boys and girls. H has seen this in her grandchildren. I countered with research showing adults treat babies differently according to whether they think the child is girl or boy. The question is not yet answered; yet women can definitely think rationally. Many people think I am a man. I asked my feminine friend Kingsley, whom I hug when I see her, whether she saw me as a woman and she dodged the question- \u201cI see you as you!\u201d So I see me as me. I am Abigail, and that is enough. I don\u2019t know that this is anything innate, as taking oestradiol for fourteen years could affect it; this is who I am, now. I don\u2019t need rationality, or any other crutch. I love them both, and thought of bringing them together; but I don\u2019t think it would work.
