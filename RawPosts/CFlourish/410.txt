While others have to work to stay alive, I sticks my flipping hand out and get all the money I need. You there, hard working family- you would not need to worry about your car MOT, or max out your overdraft every month, if everyone did their bit. It\u2019s us scroungers that are the problem. Occasionally the DWP, representing the Good People, come down on me and say, Hey! You! Prove you are entitled. We think you are fit/ have too much capital/ are not actively seeking work. Prove it, or we will stop giving you our money! But I know the tricks, so I get away with it. I got chatting on the bus with Leslie. People tell you such things! You\u2019re far too intelligent for Eagle\u2019s Nest, he said. Oh, you\u2019re not so bad yourself. He could read in infant\u2019s school, but it was really strange cos he couldn\u2019t read at the end of primary school. Yet he had read all the listed books- the blue book, the red books, you know- and was on to library books. Then he failed his 11-plus. He said something about a female relative who was completely bald, and I thought, ey up, has he spotted my wig? Then he said how he had a man\u2019s name, Lesley is the woman\u2019s spelling, but some women use \u201cLeslie\u201d and he even gets letters to Miss Leslie Bracthurst. I\u2019m Abigail. Like a lady\u2019s maid, he says- yes, Abigail Masham, Queen Anne\u2019s maid. It\u2019s quite a popular name now. Yes, it was distinctive when I was a child, I say. He was off to Swanston for some thing for job-seekers: he would get his CV done. I told him the trick is to go in a suit and tie. They treat you differently. He hasn\u2019t worn a suit in 29 years. It was a wedding. Get one in a charity shop. The last time he was in a charity shop, he bought a basque. Now I am really suspicious. He was going to The Rocky Horror Show. Deadpan. \u201cAbsolutely every man in the whole world gets a kick out of that, or wants to.\u201d I took tea in Oliver\u2019s with Jayne, then caught the bus home, and Leslie and another woman talked of being on the sick. It took five weeks\u2019 bed-bound, and three months house-bound, to convince her doctor she really was ill. They can\u2019t find a physical cause for her pain. Now, if she is a person in trouble, that\u2019s OK, she says she can\u2019t work for the pain and it is credible, because physical causes can\u2019t always be found. But if she is a scrounger, one of the Bad people, then she is obviously just trying it on. I liked her girly-Goth style, a top with a pattern of skulls and crosses, and a full-skirted purple velvet coat with embroidery on the sleeves. Lesley\u2019s CV had been printed out. \u201cIt\u2019s all lies\u201d, he said resignedly. ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 41 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
