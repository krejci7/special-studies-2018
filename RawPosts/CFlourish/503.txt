Umm, no\u2026  Start at the beginning. Here is a feminist explaining how trans anti-discrimination laws should be drafted, if they are to be fair to persons of the female sex, which she defines. She supports females, that is, persons with female reproductive organs, against repression by patriarchal culture which restricts the expression and roles of those persons based on their reproductive organs. Hooray! So do I! Indeed, when I express myself female I am ripping that repression apart, getting rid of all the conventions which impose such restrictions. Let us join together in common cause. Read her post to find why this does not appeal to her. She asked if I liked violating boundaries, and I said yes, knowing that I was walking into a trap. I was not sure what the trap was. She replied, Violating a boundary Females set is what Rapists do. It is oppressive. Learn respect. Er, um. Rape is a unique violation, of a vagina by a penis. You would not like it if men compared themselves to rape victims. Yes, you feel violated by patriarchy, but a rape victim has been traumatised, uniquely, on top of that. And while I may have benefitted from patriarchy at various times, even oppressed women, I have not oppressed women in that way. Here is a little rhyme I learned at MCC: He drew a circle that shut me out- Heretic, rebel, a thing to flout. But love and I had the wit to win: We drew a circle and took him In! She may think she is making a rational argument, I think her argument is affected by her anger. The argument is whether trans women should be included in women\u2019s space. She says not, because \u201cfemales\u201d, those with female reproductive organs, say not. So, her definition should trump mine, because she is a real woman. I call that oppressive, and, yes, bigoted. Even her \u201ccompromise\u201d, that if I can show evidence that I have had some medical intervention towards transition such as taking hormones, requires me to prove I am allowed in women\u2019s space, restricts some trans women, and treats me as less than the Normal people. Of course expression and roles should not be defined by reproductive organs. She does not like the word \u201ckyriarchy\u201d, it is a prick word- no, it recognises that people are oppressed as well as oppressors, like black men who say \u201cDon\u2019t compare your sin to my skin\u201d as an argument against gay rights. It also takes the word \u201cpatriarchy\u201d and twists it, so that it no longer only refers to the oppression of women by men. It says other forms of oppression are important too. Actually, I love the\u00a0following from that second site, its defiance, its \u201cIf you think I am unreasonable that is not my problem\u201d- Please leave a comment, but be aware that if it contains the words \u201ccis\u201d, \u201cintersecting\u201d, \u201csex-positive\u201d, \u201cdialogue\u201d or \u201cconstructive\u201d it will be deleted automatically. No, she does not have to listen to me: she is quite entitled only to engage with people who agree with her, if she wishes. ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 51 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
