My lot are called M-T: Not \u201cMale to female,\u201d as we put it, but \u201cMale to transsexual\u201d. I read that we are men who fail at masculinity as defined by the Patriarchy, so we identify ourselves as something other, lacking, less: as female. So we oppress women simply by being as we are. Rape them, even, in that we\u00a0appropriate female body shape as men who claim the right to define and use female bodies. Well, I did try desperately hard to make a man of myself, and failed. I suppose my reality and identity do not really matter, what matters is the choice: I am happier expressing myself as female- in the way accepted in my culture- and using a female name. It does not matter whether I am merely delusional: if it is a delusion, it has proved unshakeable for the last twelve years, and though I could revert any time I wanted, I have not so wanted and do not see why that might change. In the face of hostility, I simply know I am happier. Radfems and Evangelical Christians alike deny that I am female, and I am happier. Even when I passed less well and people insulted me in the street, and I was deeply unhappy, I knew I was happier in a skirt and being insulted than presenting male and trying to\u00a0fit in. I saw an Indian trans woman\u00a0on the telly: as female, a Hijra,\u00a0she has the career choices of beggar or prostitute, but she had a middle class family and as a man had professional career possibilities: and she would still rather express herself female. Another paradox: I have a passionate desire to fit in, just be Normal, and I can only escape total misery by becoming Different, by sticking out: however unhappy I am, presenting male would be worse. I am a narcissist. My own feelings are more important to me than anything else, and I analyse them all the time. This is less than ideal. And so, I surrender. I surrender the need for the World to be other than it is. I surrender the need for others to be other than they are. I do not need you to see the World, or me,\u00a0as I see it or me. I am happier wearing skirts and using a female name.\u00a0Why that might be does not matter- sexual perversion, delusion, complete acceptance of Patriarchy and its lies, whatever. If people do not want to employ me or associate with me because I am transsexual I am still happier wearing skirts (or tight jeans- women often compliment my legs). I do not need to mop up the last\u00a0extremists, the Evangelicals who say I am not a woman: what they think of me is none of my business, and I am sure enough that I am not going to Hell. I rub along with most people I meet well enough.  All I need to know is that, like this, I am happier. ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 49 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
