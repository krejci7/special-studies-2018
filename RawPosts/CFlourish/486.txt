new life trans acceptance celebration compliment game masculine 
 “I find you particularly masculine”. This sort of comment has been irking me for ten years, all sorts of judgments creating all sorts of echoes in my head, am I right to transition, am I safe from prejudice, what will happen? I do not pass properly, I need to do more work on voice and mannerisms and dress, so I can hide that away- Oh, it is just dreadful, time to hide away in the living room again. It is time to turn that response around. Why on Earth should it be a bad thing to be masculine? Let’s try again. -Clare, I find you particularly masculine. -Yes. Isn’t it wonderful? Greater physical strength than most women, and the ability to project my voice from my chest. I give wonderful cuddles, women can just melt into my arms. This can work for anything. Clare, I find you particularly whiny. Yes. Isn’t it Wonderful? The squeaky wheel gets the most oil! Clare, I find you particularly Nazi. Yes! Isn’t it Wonderful? A complete sense of my own superiority and right to organise everything, and willingness to fight anyone who gets in my way. So, this is my new party game, for any number of players. A. B, may I pay you a compliment? B assents fulsomely A: B, I find you particularly- B: Yes! Isn’t it Wonderful? B states why.
