It is not a new thought: the line in my mind was the Colonel\u2019s Lady an\u2019 Judy O\u2019Grady Are sisters under their skins! and I stick by that\u00a0on looking at that whole\u00a0poem. The\u00a0auld sodger in whose voice it is slips away when Kipling says that.\u00a0I am sure\u00a0there\u00a0is something Biblical on the thought, even if St Paul often articulates our different gifts. A quick search for \u201cWe are all one\u201d yields this. \u201cWe are all brothers and sisters\u201d yields Glenn Beck!\u00a0For a British person, whose glimpses of Fox News are in satire showing how weird\u00a0these Americans can be, with Beck the principal exhibit, that was a surprise.\u00a0However, while it is a sentiment anyone may mouth, it is a truth each person has to see for themself, experientially, and ideally in the muck and mire of living, not just in meditation on retreat. Like j\u2019s deepening conversation. What gets in the way of the realisation is the masks each of us wear, pretending to be normal. The mask creates a feeling of inadequacy, and impairs our vision of other people: we think they are closer to \u201cnormal\u201d than we are. I am taking mine off. All the time. The mask of being male was impossible for me, but when I transitioned to female I still kept a great deal of my reserve and silence, which is also too painful for me. Quentin Crisp, gay when that was dangerous, said What I want is to be accepted by other people without bevelling down my individuality to please them- because if I do that, all the attention, all the friendship, all the hospitality that I receive is really for somebody else of the same name. I want love on my own terms. One friend says of my sharing, \u201cit is so wonderfully surprising how open and vulnerable you are. I truly admire you.\u201d I discount that less than I would have at one time.\u00a0A reserved and private man, quite eminent in his field, who once told me of being very badly hurt by the dysfunctional Cardiff Quaker meeting, called my earlier effusions \u201ccries for help\u201d and counselled me against them. It is important for me to state precisely why I am so open and vulnerable. I am not showing off my insecure spots to be rescued and validated by others, to have someone say \u201cthere there\u201d and kiss me better, to be accepted so that I can accept myself- for that is what I wanted, and when I could not accept or value myself, no amount of validation expressed by others was enough for me. I am taking off my masks because my aim is to accept and value all the bits which the masks hide, all the bits which I am self-conscious about. So that I can achieve the state in my tag line, \u201cOpen heart, independent mind\u201d which I took from a strong-minded friend who I think is closer to that state than I am. Or Neil Peart\u2019s Cinderella Man- eyes wide open heart undefended innocence untarnished This is the best way I can see right now towards my own flourishing and growth, and ability to survive in the world. I am taking off the masks, or the Shell, because I cannot live that way any more. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 I am a primate, and primates are social animals. So other people have great power over me. But the nature of that power and its exercise has changed. All my friend did was touch me lightly on the arm- two fingers by the elbow- and kiss me on the cheek, but such is the state of my heightened sensibility at the moment that I was- the best word I can come up with for it is \u201cUnmanned\u201d. Moved to the core of my being. It was completely lovely. When I was trying to pretend to be a man, repressing all my feelings, that would have had no effect on me at all. I remain lonely, and starving for such connection- and now it is possible, and I will find it. In the coffee shop, the woman behind the counter said \u201cThat is \u00a33.10, \u2018s\u201d. I was not sure I had heard aright. What did you say? \u201cThat\u2019s \u00a33.10.\u201d Did you say anything after that? She denied it. Then she said, \u201cThere\u2019s your change, sir\u201d, and this time admitted it. So, calmly, I took time to explain to her. \u201cThat is not the right word. What do you think the right word is?\u201d With the sound of disbelieving questioning, she said, \u201cMadam?\u201d So I explained to her that\u00a0I am a woman, and I feel insulted by the implication that I am a man.\u00a0She apologised. Now, I am irritated. I do not have time for such petty games, and buying a coffee should be a pleasant experience, as I am sure Darcy Willson-Rymer\u00a0would agree. But I am no longer subject to this woman\u2019s power. I am not, now, lying curled up in a ball on the floor weeping, as I might have been ten years ago.
