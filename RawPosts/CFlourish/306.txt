She is the victim, she claims. She divides us into the good trans, who co-operate with her, and the bad trans who disagree. When we are liberated, she calls that \u201coppressive\u201d. She says \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the transgender issue\u201d but it is- when you keep talking and writing about trans, that\u2019s about trans. She minimises her offence: she claims her 2004 article used \u201cinappropriate humour\u201d, but does not mention her transphobic rant on Radio 4 in 2013. Then the comments. \u201cHecuba\u201d harangues her for being too moderate: This is why we real Radical Feminists refuse to refer to biological males who pretend they are females as \u2018she.\u2019 It isn\u2019t \u2018basic manners\u2019 Bindel it is a refusal to accept male lies they are really females in a male body. But you know this already Bindel yet you continue to try and \u2018have it both ways\u2019 by pandering to the men and pretending you are a real Radical Feminist. Maria speaks up for us: for those who need to have the world in binary black and white, truth and lie, good and bad, such liberal acceptance of complexity is both threatening and incomprehensible. And then the pile-on begins: twenty responses, including one describing Caitlyn Jenner as \u201ca Republican who just killed someone\u201d. It was a car crash. All charges were dropped. Victims in the third car sued the estate of the dead woman. \u201cJo\u201d misrepresents the case to make the trans woman a monster. Then there was the Independent article. In the comments, I read we are deluded perverts, and if we object that is called \u201cnarcissistic rage\u201d. We need to be protected from our sick desire to be mutilated. The most threatening thing said is that children who we might inveigle into following us into desiring mutilation need to be protected from us. My facebook friend has just had her operation. She is an adult, and she and her female partner together can make their own choices. Her psychiatrists and surgeon are clear that this is the appropriate treatment. I speak up for the liberal acceptance of complexity. I wanted transition more than anything else in the world. I cannot imagine reverting. I want to live my life quietly. There is a great deal of anger and fear. People fear for our jobs, and our standard of living. Our anger is diverted against acceptable targets: for the right wing, immigrants and benefit claimants; but for these radical feminists, the might of the patriarchy is too large a target, so a huge amount of the anger is diverted against trans women. I wonder if Hecuba has ever met a trans woman. What did that trans woman do to her, to justify that outpouring of rage against Julie Bindel for not being transphobic enough?\u00a0She may suffer all sorts of issues personally, sex discrimination, sexist remarks, yet I am her target. If you cut me I bleed. Rants about trans folk are about me, and they frighten me. If you need to vent anger fear or frustration on the internet, vent it at the actual problem, the immediate cause of your anger. When people share incitement against trans women on the internet, and vent their anger pointlessly there, they only become more powerless.
