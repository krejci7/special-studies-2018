Would you want one of us sitting beside you in an aeroplane? What if that tranny is a terrorist? In Canada, 5.2 (1) An air carrier shall not transport a passenger if \u2026 (c) the passenger does not appear to be of the gender indicated on the identification he or she presents; In Canada, one of us cannot get a passport with the correct gender marker unless s/he has the Op scheduled within one year. Now, I can just about imagine going to check in and saying, what do you mean I do not look like a man? Dressed as girly feminine as I can, I take off my wig and putting on my baritone, I say, \u201cDo I look like a man now? No, I don\u2019t like the M on my passport either, but what can you do with a homophobic government?\u201d But I cannot imagine doing that three months after I started to live full time. Before I transitioned,\u00a0while I holidayed in the UK\u00a0expressing myself\u00a0female, when I went to Italy I presented male, because I did not want any hassle. Is there any particular reason why I should not have gone to Malta in 2002? It was only just after the Twin Towers attack.  On second thoughts, can Stephen Harper really be a bigot, when he allows himself to be photographed shaking hands with a black man? In Britain, I got a passport saying F as soon as I changed my name. My GP had to write to the passport agency saying I intended to live female life long. In Australia I read one can get a passport marked M, F or X for indeterminate; X is not open to transgender people, but\u00a0that will come. The US has dropped the surgery requirement for giving a correct gender marker on the passport. We are no threat to anyone. Like people with schizophrenia, we (and other people) are a far bigger threat to us than we to others. I now know why to oppose Mr Cameron\u2019s desire for a British Bill of Rights to replace the European Human Rights Convention. He wants a land safe for bigots. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 Then again, imagine trying to leave Canada with my current passport, and not being allowed to board the plane because some attendant thinks I look like a man?
