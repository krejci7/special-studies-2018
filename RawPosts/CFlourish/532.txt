The objectionable thing is that they are oppressive. Offence, after all, is a two way street. A cis-sexual white male can be genuinely offended by\u00a0a gay person\u00a0picking him up on his thoughtlessly heteronormative way of expressing himself. If offending someone were the criterion for being objectionable, then the \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d of the gay person is equally objectionable. However, heteronormative language reinforces the idea of gay people as less than normal, pitiable, different, other. It oppresses us. Oppression is a bad thing. My objection opposes that oppression. This is a good thing. It promotes equality, it promotes freedom for everyone, because \u201cNormal is what everyone else is and you are not\u201c. Hat tip to Genderbitch, who (to my regret) is taking a rest from blogging at the moment, for this one. What of the person who says I am in denial, that I am simply a man? That person is ignoring the growing body of evidence that I am not; privileging the hypothesis that I am male, so ignoring other hypotheses; and rejecting my own assertion, after years of denial and self-examination and a deep commitment to Truth, that I am female.\u00a0I have answered that question for myself. I am female. Another\u2019s assertion that I am male, however passionate or articulate, holds no terrors for me, as it is simply wrong. But remembering how painful I found such assertions in the past, I have a particular hatred for them. ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 54 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
