When do you repent? When you realise you have something to repent of! All that time I was stating repentance weekly- the remembrance of [sins] is grievous unto us; the burden of them is intolerable- I had no particular consciousness of doing anything wrong. It\u2019s a glorious, sunny Christmas day, well above freezing. It is a Spring day in wintertime. Peter is doing the homeless charity\u2019s Christmas dinner, so drives me to Meeting. I walk from there to the Meeting house, wishing a man and a small girl Merry Christmas. In Meeting, I am moved to minister. I feel Joy. I walked here from the Sunlight centre, and felt Joy. I was tempted to overreach my leading, preaching a little homily, but that was it, so I sit. The acoustic\u2019s dreadful in here. K is moved to respond to my ministry, but he heard the word \u201cdry\u201d not \u201cjoy\u201d. He speaks of Patriarchy: oppressive expectations and coercive control of women and girls, but inability to be really themselves for men and boys too. (Well, it is a man talking.) He is talking at school of patriarchy, which makes Western civilisation dry. I really want to correct him. I said \u201cJoy\u201d, the happy union of delight and contentment, not \u201cdry\u201d. However, that is against the rules. You do not speak more than once in a meeting. I have to allow it. No real damage is done. I said \u201cI am selfish,\u201d and that delighted me. It was terrifying, then it became alright. It is liberating. I am not worthless when I am not perfect, I am human, and in between.  I am generous I am courageous I am perceptive I am creative I am truthful I am cursed   and I am selfish and I am cowardly and I am cloddish except when I am not and I dissimulate and I am blessed   Have I no control? That is bearable, because it has to be. Anyway having control, like a child playing with a train set, might pall. Real human beings are far more interesting. I do bad things, including where I cannot say sorry or be forgiven, and scarce know how bad they are: Did that hurt you? Does the fact that I did not realise make it OK, or make it worse? I mean well. Normally that is enough, sometimes it isn\u2019t, and anyway in the long run we\u2019re all dead. Life is tragic, a matter of loss after loss, and beautiful, with finite discrete moments of joy. Some people this driven, who must always be perfect, have the talent to manage it; but faced with evidence of my imperfection I have fled and hid. No-one could be as good as I wanted to be. So. Metanoia. You change when you realise you have to, and that it is possible. I will not drive myself so harshly: I will accept my imperfections. Only then can I see them clearly, and bear them; and keep buggering on, and mitigate them. Another opposite: I had been overweeningly arrogant, seeing myself as the centre of the universe, and self-abasing, seeing myself as worthless. Neither of these views were accurate. Self-acceptance might bring self-knowledge, and a just appraisal of my capacities. Though I will always get things wrong- the world, and all the life in it, is too complex a puzzle for me, to puzzle it out.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 19 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
