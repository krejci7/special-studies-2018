This could lead to lasting damage. The Gender diversity and Transgender identity in Children factsheet of the American Psychological Association says 5 to 12% of girls and 2 to 6% of boys exhibit cross-gender behavior. With numbers that high, the definition of \u201cnormal gendered behaviour\u201d is the problem, not the children. Let them play, experiment, be who they are! It is hard to estimate the numbers of lesbian and gay people. Do you survey how many have ever had homosexual experience, or who have had homosexual experience in the last year? And people are still scared of saying they are gay rather than straight, and will identify as heterosexual despite gay experience. But asked to place themselves on the Kinsey scale, with six boxes rather than two, only 72% of British adults identified as exclusively heterosexual. Wikipedia is interesting on this, and that is as far as I have gone- I am not an expert, merely trying to form my own understanding of the best way to treat children. People are far too complex for either/or, gay/straight, trans/cis. My personal interest is in beta males with viragos, derided so long as not real men, as pussy-whipped. Such beta-males can be very feminine. So I love the APA\u2019s position now: There are three main approaches to psychological intervention with gender diverse children including a \u201cgender affirmative\u201d approach, a \u201cwait and see if these behaviors desist\u201d approach, or actively discouraging gender non-conforming behavior. The gender affirmative model is grounded in the evidence-based idea that attempting to change or contort a person\u2019s gender does harm. Psychological interventions should aim to help children understand that their gender identity and gender expression are not a problem. Providers should aim to non-judgmentally accept the child\u2019s gender presentation and help children build resilience and become more comfortable with themselves, without attempting to change or eliminate cross-gender behavior. Children who experience affirming and supportive responses to their gender identity are more likely to have improved mental health outcomes. Gender identity is resistant, if not impervious to environmental manipulation. Moreover, attempts to change a child\u2019s gender may have a negative impact on the child\u2019s well-being. Parents and schools are the problem. Most of the therapeutic work is with the parents, to prevent them suppressing the child\u2019s harmless but surprising behaviour: Often, the most important intervention is helping the family to cope with and live for some time with the uncertainty about the child\u2019s gender and sexual identity development. They need to be advocates for their children. Providers should advocate for children to be safe in schools while exploring gender diverse expression. Pardon me while I scream at the floor- \u201cChildren should be safe in schools\u201d! It needs to be said!!!!!!! If children\u2019s natural, harmless gender expression is not tolerated by parents, schools or peers, they may exhibit the usual extreme stress reactions of children, such as \u201cOppositional defiance\u201d or \u201cADHD\u201d; or depression, rocking, cutting\u2026 The fact sheet at first appears to distinguish \u201cgender diverse\u201d children, who express their gender in ways that are not consistent with socially prescribed gender roles or identities, from \u201ctransgender\u201d children, who consistently, persistently, and insistently express a cross-gender identity and feel that their gender is different from their assigned sex. Later, though, it conflates the two: Fully reversible interventions such as a social gender transition including changing clothing, name change, new pronouns, or changes in haircuts may be indicated for some gender diverse and transgender children. And why not exploration? Let little Stephen come to school as Clare occasionally, if s/he wants. Let Clare be boyish and Stephen girlish. We need to know which the child is at the time that hormone therapy is prescribed, and not before. APA fact-sheet pdf. beta males. Wikipedia on demographics of sexual orientation.
