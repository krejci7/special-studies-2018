Ten years since I last pretended to be a man. I pretended to be a man at work, but ten years ago I sorted that out. -Like Hayley? Yes, actually. I rarely watch Corrie, but I was aware of Hayley Cropper (picture copyright). Then\u00a0J told me if that was what made me happy, that was alright with her, and introduced me to her beautiful cat. He is a Bengal cat, she explained, related to wild cats, which gives him a more striking personality. She had to tempt him out from under the bed, with\u00a0a cat toy. It is irritating that they did not get a trans woman to act the character. Nor did the film TransAmerica. And I would rather that people did not feel the need to explain to me that they can accept me as I am, because that implies that it might be doubted- though it was I who brought the subject up. Still, I think Hayley has done a lot for us, and would rather be accepted than gossiped about. J is OK. She is coming to my party. Party! This evening!
