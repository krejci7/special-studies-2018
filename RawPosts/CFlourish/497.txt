What I do here is close to that. Do I avoid it? According to Wikipedia, Judith Butler argues: that the coherence of the categories of sex, gender, and sexuality\u2014the natural-seeming coherence, for example, of masculine gender and heterosexual desire in male bodies\u2014is culturally constructed through the repetition of stylized acts in time. These stylized bodily acts, in their repetition, establish the appearance of an essential, ontological \u201ccore\u201d gender.This is the sense in which Butler famously theorizes gender, along with sex and sexuality, as performative. The performance of gender, sex, and sexuality, however, is not a voluntary choice for Butler, who locates the construction of the gendered, sexed, desiring subject within what she calls, borrowing from Foucault\u2019s Discipline and Punish, \u201cregulative discourses.\u201d These, also called \u201cframeworks of intelligibility\u201d or \u201cdisciplinary regimes,\u201d decide in advance what possibilities of sex, gender, and sexuality are socially permitted to appear as coherent or \u201cnatural.\u201d Regulative discourse includes within it disciplinary techniques which, by coercing subjects to perform specific stylized actions, maintain the appearance in those subjects of the \u201ccore\u201d gender, sex and sexuality the discourse itself produces\u2026Butler explicitly challenges biological accounts of binary sex, reconceiving the sexed body as itself culturally constructed by regulative discourse. Um. Our species produces sperm and ova, which unquestionably have a binary sexual purpose. How do trannies fit in? I say I am female, and because I have been acculturated as male that must mean that there is something innate about my Femininity, even if I express it with my culture. To radical feminists, I am therefore oppressing queers and women by affirming patriarchal culture. So the radical feminists and the transsexuals play oppression olympics, each claiming to be oppressed by the other. This argument produces more heat than light. I could say, well, a Grand Unified Theory of Humanity is more elusive than one for Physics. There\u00a0will be exceptions. Please accept me as an exception. Let me not fit the theory of Judith Butler and others. Accept that there is something innate in me, or treat me as an aberration: that I do not fit the theory is no reason to condemn me. I choose to express myself\u00a0as \u201cfeminine\u201d according to my culture,\u00a0and have myself surgically altered because it was better than the alternative. This does not mean that gender, generally, is not cultural, nor that each person should be forced into a particular\u00a0gender and sexuality expression: indeed by choosing contrary to my upbringing, I affirm the right of each person to choose, and subvert that cultural expectation of my Masculinity. If everyone\u00a0should have\u00a0a completely free choice of gender expression, then choices will have a wide variation: and no-one has the right to police or challenge another person\u2019s choice.
