new life trans AVP prostitute 
 At one personal growth thing, I met X. He had had a chaotic  life, addicted to skunk, living in squats, TWOCking for money or fun, and now  he had a job and was going through college. At another, I met a man who hinted at a violent background such that I did not want any more details. And here he  was, with those of us seeking enlightenment, the highest Good, the Good Life,  God, whatever, seeking alongside me. And he said to me, “I grew up in the  plague zone, and I caught the plague”. I do not think he was trying to exculpate himself, or excuse  his acts. I think he was stating a fact, that the sins of the fathers are visited  upon the Children- not because God is vengeful, just because that is the way it  is- and that people can escape it, with luck or synchronicity, as he had. In a  bad situation, people do bad things, and that does not make them bad people. We  are all doing our best, some of us under difficult circumstances. When my friend said she would prostitute herself, I begged  her not to, and she said she had no money. I actually drove her to the pick-up  joint. The paedophile had a key ring, with four fobs on it, each with a picture  of a child’s face, and I could not bear to look at it. Then I asked him, “What  do you want from me?” He said, “I want you to make it so I don’t have to fear  any more,” and my heart opened to him. All of us have the potential for growth. All of us have  something of God within us. Any one of us may step forward on the path to  enlightenment. Notes I love the Alternatives to Violence Project, which runs  courses all around the UK, across the world, and particularly in prisons, where  people learn by experience constructive ways of resolving conflict. There,  douce middle-class people like me can meet with people caught up in the  criminal justice system and the family courts, and grow together.
