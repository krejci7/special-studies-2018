I read that and thought, that\u2019s a bit harsh; but, yes. It is a lot of work. How do you express yourself with clothes, and also fit into the fashions, when you have an unfeminine body-shape? I know that many women have unfashionable body-shapes, that there is a great deal of body-shaming and that fashions can be at one moment flattering to particular people, the next month not. It is not easy for cis women; I tend to feel it is more difficult for us. I don\u2019t get my voice right. I have a story for that: the speech therapist told me to practise a little bit throughout the day, and that meant breaching my male presentation. Like carrying a heavy pack: I could just about plod on, grimly, but repeatedly putting the pack down then shouldering it again was unbearable. But then, it is a long time since I transitioned, even if immediately after practise reminded me of that distress. I have practiced my voiced th, which is particularly difficult to get above the break. You start with n and m, easy enough, and go onto more difficult sounds. This That the Other. This That the Other. This That the Other. This That the Other, I say, listening to the sound. Then other words with that \u00f0 sound. Father. Brother. Thus. Lathe. It is a \u201cvoiced dental fricative\u201d. Blogging gets me doing the work, I have broken off to google the sound. \u00f0 and \u00d0 run in my mind. There is value in practice, and in other sounds, other words. Oh, I could say I like being able to speak baritone, for emphasis, or when I am tired and not thinking about it; singing, my baritone is better able to keep a note, pleasanter, and much stronger than my countertenor/falsetto; And there are mannerisms, responses and habits- women are less likely to drink pints, or single malts- It is a great deal of work. Do you have the motivation? Is not-passing bearable? Does it fulfil some need for attention? Right now I don\u2019t pass. I see that passing might have some advantages, in encounters with people uncomfortable with trans folk- certainly in job interviews- Not just motivation but belief in its possibility. Is it that every marker I shave off makes it longer before people read me, or do I just have so many markers that however much work I do I will never make it? There are markers no work will alter: I am tall for a woman, though not shockingly so\u2026 my face does not look that unfeminine, surely? Not to me, not when I am feeling confident\u2026 There may be markers I am not aware of, unknown unknowns\u2026 Why is my life so hard? It ought not to be this hard (sense of entitlement)\u2026 For whatever reason, fourteen years on, I have not done the work. Is it worth it? There is another view: trans women suffer gender dysphoria, and the work required to pass is the work required to minimise those male characteristics which make them dysphoric.
