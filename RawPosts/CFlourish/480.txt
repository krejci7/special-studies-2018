Gay men are disgusting and hideous, inverts, perverts.\u00a0The narrator loves women.\u00a0This is only bearable because, as with the Jews, Proust gives a patient description of how people behave under oppression; and I am certain of his sympathy because his mother was a Jew, and he was gay, and he exhibits understanding. And yet before 1920, Proust describes androphile and lesbian trans women. Some, if you come on them unawares in the morning, still in bed, display an admirable woman\u2019s head, so general is the expression and symbolic of the sex as a whole; the hair itself declares it; its inflection is so feminine, when loosened, it falls so naturally on the cheek in tresses, that you marvel that the young woman, the girl, Galatea, barely awake as yet in the unconscious of this man\u2019s body in which she is imprisoned, should have been able so ingeniously, of her own accord\u2026 to take advantage of the humblest escape route from her prison and find what was necessary to her life. These, trans women though presenting male, do not\u00a0tell others\u00a0\u201cI am a woman\u201d unless their mistress is a lesbian (a \u201ccitizen of Gomorrah\u201d). They are of two kinds: androphile and gynephile. When I read that the androphile are \u201cthose whose childhoods were the most self-conscious\u201d I feel exquisite vulnerability: this man saw Me, before Magnus Hirschfeld, before Lili Elbe. So what does he say of my kind? [We], whose senses are no doubt more violent, give imperious location to our physical pleasures\u2026we\u00a0play the role of another woman for\u00a0the women who love women, and the woman offers us more or less what we find in a man. Such people cannot express ourselves as female. Some young madmen in order to tease their friends or shock their parents display a sort of fury in choosing clothes that look like dresses, in reddening their lips and blacking their eyes; they too cruelly pay the penalty for their affectation, spending a whole lifetime trying vainly to make reparation, by their severe, protestant demeanour, for the wrong they did themselves\u2026 In behaving so scandalously, we destroy our reputation, which we can never recreate, however respectable we may seek to act, hereafter- any more than a woman who has once behaved scandalously, of whom Goldsmith said, The only art their guilt to cover\u2026 is to die! Some of the inverts are solitary. It is so hard for them to admit that they are different from normal men, that they develop hatred for their kind and may kill themselves. They \u201cnever achieve genuine maturity\u201d-\u00a0does he mean\u00a0make love, or have a real Relationship? One such solitary pines over a cousin, who marries, and finds another male lover; and a railwayman, who is posted to a different part of France. De Charlus\u2019s own brother does not know directly that he is gay, but has heard of his reputation, so when he says \u201cYou never had the same tastes as everyone else\u201d he is embarassed, and starts to protest about Palamede\u2019s love of women. We will return to these people,\u00a0Proust says. I will write further on this.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 48 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
