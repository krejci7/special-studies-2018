In the December issue there is an article claiming Trans activists are ruling the world, but not thinking that a good thing, and at least three other mentions of transgender. There are possibly more, but the magazine is too boring for me to bother looking for them. This next bit is so vile I put it in small print, so you can dodge it if hate triggers you. \u201cWhat is it about transgender?\u201d I asked. \u201cThey\u2019re crazy,\u201d he said. This was before progressive norms prevented us even contemplating hate speech. \u201cHow do you mean crazy?\u201d I asked. \u201cAggressive, violent, disturbed, disruptive, impossible to reason with,\u201d he said. \u201cReally crazy\u201d. This comes after the writer claims to be bisexual, perhaps to indicate he could not possibly be prejudiced. The tone of the writing is supposedly \u201clight and humorous\u201d. It\u2019s awful. He refers to \u201ccutting off the most definitive evidence of manhood\u201d, asks if a \u201ctransgendered woman\u201d is \u201cactually- or originally- a woman or a man?\u201d and compares us to Otherkin. Well, no-one is weirder than me, but the author probably does that to make us look bad. Frankly, the science is a bit beyond me. That\u2019s the Oldie\u2019s schtick, pretending not to understand anything after about 1980, or anything at all really. Elsewhere in the magazine Virginia Ironside, their agony aunt, says In other words, and to use a vile expression, chill out. I don\u2019t think she realises \u201cchill out\u201d has been replaced by \u201cchill\u201d. Her objection is that it is a new phrase, not an old one. I\u2019m still stuck on the basics: bathroom rights, male rapists declaring themselves female to get transferred to women\u2019s prisons, linebackers coming out as women to play professional football. He paints us as a ridiculous, disgusting threat. He is delighted TERFs oppose us: Reactionary schools of thought hope this is the progressive movement consuming itself. That the contradictions will swallow the whole thing.  What else? In a review of a film by Sally Potter, the writer says she gave us a sublime Orlando, starring Tilda Swinton as the transgenderiste (sic) Virginia Woolf heroine. Oh well. And in \u201cHow to spot a decent vicar this Christmas\u201d there\u2019s this: Forward in Faith\u2019s website states, \u201cWe are unable in conscience to accept the ordination of women as priests and bishops\u201d. This view is increasingly absurd in an age of gender dysphoria. Martyn Percy, the Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, says, \u201cWill Forward in Faith be able to tell us at what point a person\u2019s valid ordination either evaporates or crystallises in the process of gender transition?\u201d Michael Cole thinks the \u201cobsession with equality and diversity is killing quality television\u201d, because nothing damages TV more in his eyes than having people different from himself on it. The survey would be asking me about my gender, \u2018gender identity\u2019, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability. Note the scare quotes, as if gender identity is not a real category. He objects: The real purpose of collecting this information is to limit the creative freedom of people working in television\u2026 [and] control what appears on the screen and who is in it. \u201cWho is in the screen\u201d? No, Michael, that is liquid crystals rotating polarised light, or in your case perhaps a stream of cathode rays, not tiny people. Trans is something new fangled, one more way the world is going to hell in a handcart, for Oldie readers and writers to resent. They have not heard of Elagabalus. Trans is as old as Deuteronomy, but with their affected ignorance they would not know that. Oh for the good old days when trans people would not be seen, or heard, they say. Harry Mount, the editor, also writes for the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph. This is the year of transgender moral panic, where we are the subject of daily press articles abominating us. The transphobes are out in force, in what I hope is a desperate rearguard action to prevent our rights and recognition, their desperation being a sign they know they will fail; but I fear my country\u2019s increasingly authoritarian turn. I wrote that, then was so bored that I leafed through the rest of the magazine. For the fiftieth anniversary of Just a Minute, there is a lazy rehash of some of its jokes. Giles Brandreth began, \u2018Nicholas, or as close friends know him, \u2018Susan\u2019, is the first transsexual to host a panel show in this country. Oh God, there\u2019s more of it! For relief, here is a writer not consumed with anger about every change in his world. The Romanian homeless guy prays alongside the person who is transitioning and next to the old Etonian ex-army officer. People go through all sorts of transitions- going to university, starting a family- but you know exactly what Giles Fraser means, and he expects all his audience to. Our language is becoming the norm.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 4 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
