I want to be who I am, and not to hide that from others or myself. All my accretions and pretenses and lies to myself and habits which get in the way of that are things I have taken up in order to Survive, and they are the things in the way of my flourishing now. On this blog and in my retreat from the World I am working out what that might mean. Possibly it is anatomical: the amygdala in conflict with the frontal lobe- and the idea of the Real Me, under all the attempts of my parents and society to \u201ccivilise\u201d me, is so attractive to me. So much for the origin of this post, written in a Tea meditation, a desperate search for how to be. On the bus, a woman says, \u201cthese chairs are so uncomfortable, so uncomfortable\u201d and I note how I place her immediately, the word \u201cchehs\u201d- one of those decanted from London- rather than the more correct and educated \u201cseats\u201d. When we all get off, and queue by the stairs, a little girl tries to push ahead downwards, and her mummy tells her to wait. Then a man with them grabs her by the back of her coat, and she immediately starts to struggle and cry out. Just to rub that in, for my benefit not yours, she fights the restraint of a man so much larger. I note a red\u00a0heart just above her bottom- what a gorgeous birthmark! If it is a tattoo- He picks up their pushchair from the lower deck, and says \u201ccheers, mate\u201d to the driver in a gruff but cheerful, salt-of-the-earth manner. In the street, I note a woman in a long floral dress and a bulky floral headscarf, Muslim \u201cmodest\u201d dress made beautiful. Is it just the Autumn sunshine making me feel this good? Anyway, where was I? Oh yes. The Struggle for the Real Me. Thing is, the pain and distress are real, the unknowing, the old self-protection mechanisms which I have taken up to survive and now hurt me, the difficulty in perceiving all this, because I feel that my false perception is reality and the constrained way of behaving is Right and Good- all Real. And so are the flashes of insight, and the Progress, and the absolute commitment to do this work, and the necessity of it. I thought my opening a bit whiny, and then looking back at it, it is positive. What do I want from anyone else? Nothing. Ah. Can I say that, really? I know that is the right thing to say. I know that any other response causes me needless pain, am I really there yet? Not sure. I know that is the place to be, loving the beauty of all good things, undaunted by bad, and that further on good and bad cease to have meaning for all is good. Actually, I am fair pleased with mysel that I have the theory! ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 47 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
