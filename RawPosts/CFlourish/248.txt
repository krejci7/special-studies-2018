This is obvious quoad gay people: no-one except homophobes suggests that there is any sort of gay movement. People are accepted as gay whatever their political views- they do not have to explain themselves. They couldn\u2019t. -Why are you gay? -I don\u2019t know, I just am. I\u2019m left handed too! Epigenetics produces an algorithm which can predict homosexuality with 70% accuracy, so there is evidence of a biological basis, but even before October 2015 people of good will accepted that \u201cSome people are gay.\u201d In the same way some people are trans. I did not join a movement, I started cross-dressing, and then decided to transition. Before there was any sort of theory why, AMAB people did, or there would be no need for Deuteronomy to forbid it. \u201cDoctor I think I\u2019m a woman. Am I insane?\u201d As seen in the film The Danish Girl, some doctors diagnosed schizophrenia, some prescribed exposure to radioactive sources- without any basis beyond the need to appear to have a solution- and some said \u201cIf you want to live as a woman, why ever not?\u201d The theory comes after the fact. Trans women are frightened of expressing ourselves female, others are hostile, so we create words. I am trans because Stuff. I have a \u201cwoman\u2019s brain\u201d or a \u201cwoman\u2019s spirit\u201d or \u201cI was a woman in a former incarnation\u201d. Then attempts are made with fMRI scanners and dissection, and the evidence is attacked as ambiguous. So people mock the idea of a \u201cwoman\u2019s brain\u201d; but even if the concept were meaningless, trans women would not disappear in a puff of logic. No-one told Elagabalus she was a woman trapped in a man\u2019s body, she just went ahead and proclaimed herself Empress, rather than Emperor, of Rome. If only our persecutors understood this! Here\u2019s a totally ridiculous, missing the point article by Robert Jensen, a professor in the School of Journalism at the University of Texas at Austin. Why a teacher of journalism would imagine he had any understanding of this, I have no idea. He thinks he\u2019s so clever, demanding, \u201cWhat would it mean to be born male but actually be female?\u201d Er, dunno. Don\u2019t care, either. My name is Clare, this is how I dress. I don\u2019t need to justify myself to you. He goes on. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you all feminists?\u201d he demands. Well, because some of us can\u2019t be bothered. I am sort of feminist- there are such variations in that movement, I could not define what \u201cfeminist\u201d is; but some people are not politically active. Is hormones and surgery consistent with an ecological worldview that takes seriously the consequences of dramatic human interventions into organisms and ecosystems? Er, dunno. I did want it, though. The Kama Sutra may mention Hijra, who are castrated: I don\u2019t know how long that has been going on. Why can\u2019t he just accept this is who I am? This is not to say that sophisticated explanation of trans is impossible, just that some dullard journalist who does not understand it has not come up with the definitive Argument which will make us go away, and that we don\u2019t have to justify ourselves to be trans. He finds me revolting, and he wants to deny that arises from prejudice. The comments make the prejudice clear: they accuse us of threatening suicide to shut down debate. No; we point out that in a miasma of hostility we may develop depression leading to suicide. Just like gays, we just are.  \u201cThe ideology of the transgender movement\u201d.
