It is objectionable. It somehow implies that those who transition should have GRS. The word is \u201ctrans\u201d; that includes all of us, and what is between our legs is no-one\u2019s business but ours and our partners\u2019. A girl-cock, a hyperenlarged clitoris, or whatever you call it, is OK. Do you feel less than others? Do you feel a nagging suspicion that real trans women know they are women, and so find the thought of having a penis unbearable? Alternatively, do you feel that you were forced by social pressure into having The Operation by doctors, transsexuals and the general public while you might not have had it, if you had had a completely free choice? Do you feel less than others? Does the existence of another group of people, which appears to share some characteristics with you but be very different in some ways, somehow make you inauthentic or less entitled to be who you are, do what you want- or do you have nagging doubts that might be so? The answer is not to lash out, and say it\u2019s the other group that have got it wrong, they are the ones who should change, or demand that they do not mention their difference from you as they should be ashamed of it. That just divides people. We can be allies. We should be able to sympathise with another\u2019s desires and support their rights, while not feeling the same. I regret the operation. I would like to be able to swive heterosexual women. I suppose being told not to utter the word \u201ctranssexual\u201d- or TS- is better than being held up as fool and victim. I wanted it at the time. My path to self-acceptance led through the Operation, and I am not sure \u201cthere was another road you did not see\u201d. Though if I were sure of that, it would be sair to thole. It was as it was. I am where I am. The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line, Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it. You see I have this huge uncertainty. There is another group, like me in some respects, unlike me in others- and I know they have this difference, though I cannot be certain that they have that advantage and I do not know what disadvantages they may have. Producing my own hormones and not using synthetic ones, my emotional lability might be less: so I could ascribe all sorts of imaginary advantages to the door you did not open\u2013 while I am at it, I would be in work, the desire to present female would have passed, I would have three children- as always with these fantasies, I would not exist and someone else would be in my place.  Guilt, resentment, yearning, shame- I am overwhelmed by these feelings as I always have been, I cast around for ways of escape which instead intensify them. However. I am transsexual. I am not going to keep quiet about that just cos someone tells me to.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 23 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
