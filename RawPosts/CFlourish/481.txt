Maybe you know how it is. I should be kneeling in my ritual space; and instead I watch TV until I think, no, I have got to\u00a0go to bed now. Or, I lie in bed, perhaps playing on WordPress, until I only have time to shower and dress and have breakfast before the bus comes. Well, actually, this morning I had five minutes before the bus was due. I might as well kneel for five minutes as not. So I knelt, and burst into tears.  Coffee with Quakers. Sue asked how my work search was going. No, I am sorting my spiritual and emotional being, I am not looking for work. Maybe later. I want to do energy healing, and I think it is mere placebo, with a bit of cold reading. K says she does not think \u201cmere\u201d is appropriate, placebo is powerful. And- I suppose cold reading is valuable, it will be reassuring for a person if I respond to her as she really is, now. \u201cCold reading\u201d is a dismissive term. Perhaps- \u201cclearly seeing\u201d a person. I want to practise Seeing.\u00a0 Then onto the usual conversation, this time Ann on how dreadful the World is, environmental degradation, chronic dishonesty in business, growing inequality, against me on how it is improving, the new Transition Towns movement, equal marriage campaigns. I love these people. Out into the sunshine. That busker has a lovely tone on the higher registers of his tenor sax, warm, sweet and smooth. I have always slung breast forms round my front. I wore big heavy bras for big heavy breast forms, because I felt that I wanted to appear as if I had breasts. Then in March I fell and bruised my ribs, and the bra was uncomfortable, and I have gone braless since. In the sauna at camp we complimented each others\u2019 breasts: I have felt mine were tiny- almost flat- and misshapen, too far round the side of the body, pointing outwards. But now, I begin to feel a little uncomfortable hurrying, I want some support. To \u201cLace\u201d in the high street. I had thought it a normal lingerie shop, but inside I see what\u00a0they sell is play-wear, basques and fishnet bodystockings, etc. They sell it by dress size. I can try it on if I want. Sorry, that is really not what I was looking for. So, to Natasha\u2019s. The bra I had felt too big in the cup, and also too tight in the back, so I wondered if she stocked a 40AA. However, I come out with a 36B, a light lacy half-cup. Don\u2019t wear it too low, or it will give no support, she tells me. I feel transformed. Under my loose sweater I have a shape I find beautiful, so much lovelier than I had thought possible. This is an experience most women have aged about 13, one\u00a0I did not think I could have.  I get the bus home. Oh, I do not want to feel this strongly! I want my feelings to be held down, strapped up, not bothering me! At war with the World at least I know where I am- but- to feel this Vulnerable- I overhear someone on his mobile. \u201cIs he with you now? Is he kicking off?\u2026 Are you driving?\u2026 Just pull over and get him to get out\u2026 No, just put the phone down and concentrate on driving. I\u2019ll see you in a minute, yeah\u2026\u201d He explains to his friend that Lorna gave Laurie a lift, and because she could not go as far as he wanted he is kicking off, and she is crying while driving. I\u2019ll kill him, the little shit.  The song the busker was playing runs in my mind. I can see clearly now, the rain has gone I can see all obstacles in my way Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind It\u2019s gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day It\u2019s gonna be a bright, bright sun-shining day ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 49 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
