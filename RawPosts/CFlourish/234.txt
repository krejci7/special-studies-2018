Journalist Tristan Cork covered a vigil for the Pulse nightclub shooting, and stuck a rainbow pin to his backpack, in solidarity. He didn\u2019t bother to remove it, and a few days later was on the bus in the evening, when someone started shouting at him:  I won\u2019t repeat what he said, but it was basically a series of statements of abuse each containing a combination of the f-word, the c-word, the b-word, the word \u2018gay\u2019, \u2018queer\u2019 and \u2018homo\u2019. I am not sure what the \u201cb\u201d word is- bugger, possibly, a term I find quaintly old-fashioned, like \u201cbloody\u201d. He had forgotten the rainbow pin, so didn\u2019t realise why the other was shouting at him. Then it clicked. He\u2019s a big bloke, and the abuser was weedy, but he still felt frightened of the situation escalating. He got off the bus as the other shouted \u201cget off the bus you fxxking queer\u201d. He is completely right about checking his privilege. I realised then that every single moment of the day and night as I walk around Bristol or travel on its buses, I subconsciously feel I am the one who is supposed to be there \u2013 a white English, straight, able-bodied man. Indeed. I have been noticing mine. He makes a fair attempt at explaining that to other white, English, straight, able-bodied men. But then he says, Whenever anyone mentions privilege there\u2019s a collective groan. You\u2019re groaning now, I bet.  No. I wasn\u2019t. I was cheering him on. Then I get to this paragraph of only five words which erases me. He assumes all his audience is straight. It\u2019s a slap in the face. I know he\u2019s trying to explain to straight people who haven\u2019t really thought about it before. I know he is using his journalistic skills to get through to them. I am grateful. And I don\u2019t want to be grateful, because I don\u2019t want to have anything to be grateful for. He\u2019s an ally, and it rubs my nose in the fact that I need allies, because some people are like the abusive man. I knew that already. I have come across them. There\u2019s also his line about being jokingly called Asberger\u2019s. Asberger\u2019s is a gift: my friend has high intelligence and a retentive memory, sensitive empathy and an inability to work because people have thoughtlessly, cruelly found him not \u201cnormal\u201d and therefore less than normal. It is a sickening waste. When you say you\u2019re an ally, you point up that I need allies, so you may receive my anger. It\u2019s nothing personal. That thing about wearing safety pins to say you would step in if there was a racial attack. Ooh, look, I have a safety pin just in case you can\u2019t see the brightness of my halo. Well, I don\u2019t wear a safety pin, because I am worried about diverting abuse onto me. I have not seen such abuse, but am not sure I would intervene. Tristan\u2019s article.
