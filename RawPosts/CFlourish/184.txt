Just as there is clear anti-semitism, like the blood libel, and justified opinions which are not, such as opposing house demolitions in the Occupied Territories, there is clear transphobia and questionable opinions which are disputed. Some would say even the opinion that trans women should not use women\u2019s public toilets is not transphobic, and work hard to produce the appearance of rationality and concern for the vulnerable, arguing that. Perhaps trans folk would extend the definition too far. Some people have a Yuck reaction to us. As with anti-semitism, many of them get self-righteous about it, like the woman who objects to the feminine presentation of trans women, claiming any feminist would find that presentation disempowers women, as if we had the power to be fashion leaders. How calm is that person, really? How far do they want to exclude us from ordinary life? What proportion of their writing concerns trans women, rather than other feminist concerns? It seems to me that some people cannot imagine that yuck reaction, and I wonder how I can convince them. A man in the shopping mall who had never seen me before hissed \u201cf\u2013king nonce\u201d as he passed me, and I wondered what I had done that he so hated me. A group of drunk young men on the train, and one shouts, \u201cOh look, it\u2019s a tranny\u201d, and they continue shouting until they get off. Fortunately my friend was in First Class, safely apart from them. Just possibly, that might be societal transphobia rather than individual, deliberate hatred; not all of them are repelled, but none stops the others from shouting and perhaps they would say, \u201cBut, it\u2019s a tranny! Wouldn\u2019t everyone shout at a tranny?\u201d if asked why they were shouting. Just boisterous young men with normal animal spirits? A shopper takes a second look at you, and exclaims, \u201cIt\u2019s a man!\u201d But she was just shocked and surprised, and vocalises a passing thought, as anyone might stare at someone a little out of the ordinary. \u201cF\u2013king nonce,\u201d though. Calling me a sex offender. No idea who I am beyond reading me as male, dressed female. That\u2019s not a normal reaction to people like me, surely? Might you believe that it was phobic? If someone I think of as a friend could imagine herself exclaiming \u201cIt\u2019s a man,\u201d the first time she had seen a trans woman in the street, could imagine herself feeling \u201cBless my soul\u201d levels of shock, because, well, trans women really are out of the ordinary- even though perfectly acceptable- could someone be my friend, chat happily with me, then say, \u201cWell, you are a bit weird, really. You aren\u2019t normal. I don\u2019t hold it against you, I like you, really\u2026\u201d but me being trans is if not the elephant then the sweaty runner\u2019s shirt in the room, which we don\u2019t see but which insinuates itself into everyone\u2019s nostrils\u2026 How widespread is the \u201cI am perfectly accepting, but face it you are a bit weird\u201d sort of attitude? Would they say, \u201cSurely everyone\u2019s like that, I would not shout abuse but I would notice, surely you can\u2019t object to that?\u201d Am I too sensitive? Transphobia exists. \u201cF\u2013king nonce\u201d is an example of that. Yet friends don\u2019t seem to realise. A man. I hear he is now in prison: he did not attend the first sentencing hearing, threatening suicide, but did attend the second a day or two after I had the misfortune to meet him. He came to the Quaker meeting once and left after ten minutes, not liking the silence. Then he came a few weeks later just before we were about to finish, and we gave him a cup of coffee. He sat in the corner. We did not start a conversation with him, nor he with us, but I took him over the cup of coffee and offered him a biscuit which he declined. People were leaving, and he made no sign of wanting to, so I told him we needed him to leave. He objected. I explained and he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a man or a woman\u201d and continued objecting, standing close to me, and waving his hand near my face. At this point people notice and come over to see what is going on. They see me in a confrontation with a man. So after he has actually left, I explain what happened, and someone says, \u201cWell, that\u2019s your account of it.\u201d Honestly, what? It\u2019s transphobia. Have you no memory, no gay friends, you never saw someone abused simply because he was gay? That man could only object to me if I had done something objectionable? The EEUghH reaction, the hatred, for Jews, black people, gays, Manchester United supporters- some people are prejudiced and react violently- you are aware it exists, right? Can you not imagine that someone might be prejudiced against people like me, without any other reason? Do you sympathise with their shock or revulsion? So, you look at me, disbelievingly, without sympathy when I explain how horrible the situation had been, and how can I possibly get through to you?
