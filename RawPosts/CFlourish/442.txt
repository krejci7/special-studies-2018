This is for the Trifecta challenge, again, use the word \u201cbrand\u201d, in its third definition- 3a (1) : a mark made by burning with a hot iron to attest manufacture or quality or to designate ownership (2) : a printed mark made for similar purposes : trademark b (1) : a mark put on criminals with a hot iron (2) : a mark of disgrace : stigma- in a piece between 33 and 333 words. I like the challenge of 33. I was going to write this in 333 words, but why use 333 when you can use 33? I found the video of Dwayne Jones at Annie Paul. Please comment. As this is a writing challenge, constructive criticism is particularly welcome. ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 45 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
