Mummy looks at toddler worriedly.  Mummy says, \"Is there anything you want?\"  Silence.  \"Would you like a biscuit?\" That was the pretext of the last battle. NO Mummy reaches out, and sets her off again.   NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO  \u00a0 I understand, I assure you. I need to get myself a job, get out among  people, earn money, support myself, get myself out of this stuckness.  Or do something I enjoy doing, cheer myself up, stop being so negative.  And all my   I WANT is capable of, all she can manage at the moment, is NO. In the sauna I complain my nipples are wrong, and get the standard  feminine response, that they are absolutely fine, that there is a huge  variation in nipples. And this upsets me more, because it is not relieving  this anxiety but devaluing my greater anxiety, that I look like a man,  I look like a tranny.  Or someone says \"Your skin is so soft!\" and I hear surprise, and I hear,  underneath, \"You're a man, you're a tranny, how come your skin is so soft?\"  Though perhaps that implication is not intended. \u00a0 Lighting the fire,   fanning the flames- \u00a0 I am, no, not normal, no-one is normal, but- Acceptable.  How can I take that into myself? How can I breathe it in?  It seems clearer, kneeling in my ritual space. It seems strengthened when I tap into the Universe to refresh my Qi.  So, despite the apparently intellectual objections, this cannot be real, this  cannot make sense, etc, etc, yada yada yada  I need to do that.
