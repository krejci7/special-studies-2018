Because she\u2019s always that nasty and stupid, and they\u2019re all like that, all the time: misogynist, domineering, self-centred, masculine, and for them it\u2019s all about them. Peak trans is hash tags and websites where women can share these stories and say, well, I was a liberal feminist and pro-trans, or at least not completely hostile until I met one and got revolted. Because they are revolting. Or until I read something on the internet. Let\u2019s consider some \u201cPeak trans\u201d claims. Google for the quotes, if you really must. And I may not be correct here in assuming this but considering autogynephilia IS a paraphilia along with pedophilia it makes perfect sense that these MtT are attracted to underage girls. Some of them are even twisted enough to fantasize that they ARE teenage girls inside their own heads. MtT is \u201cMale to Trans\u201d. She is well down the rabbit hole, perhaps never tolerant of trans women. Her \u201cPeak trans\u201d moment was when she first heard of the concept and was revolted- but rather than thinking, this is a human being, she sought out justification for her hostility. Considering mice are mammals along with elephants, perhaps mice can weigh several tons. Or perhaps not. I found myself thinking that maybe I ( a socialist) will vote for Cruz because at least then he will appoint conservative judges who won\u2019t give in to the bathroom bullshit. What the hell world am I living in that I actually have that thought??? A world where hating trans women is more important to you than not starting wars, not teaching Creationism as science, or women having access to abortion. This woman self-identified as a trans man for a bit, but changed her mind. The final crack was seeing a trans woman I used to follow, post a photo of herself in a nice dress, for a night out. Something really irked me about it: she stood in a ridiculous little-girl pose (she\u2019s middle aged), complete with high heel slightly raised in the air. I didn\u2019t see an empowered woman. I saw a man in a dress, mocking women. So that trans woman should dress to please other women, not herself? She goes on, Now I read on here every day. It makes me feel confident, supported, and even loved. I LOVE feeling like I\u2019ve found answers, but most importantly, community with like-minded women. Because when you are in a cult defined around identifying yourself as persecuted and another group as deserving to be hated simply for a single characteristic they share, your hate is addictive. Beware addictions which distract you from your real-life problems. I have been calling this the trans-cult for a long time. I lost my partner of 5 years to it, 5 years ago and he has ruined his life as a result. Perhaps our union wasn\u2019t going to last anyway but he actually severed it by following this cult online and eventually going behind my back to get hormones from his doctor. People often dislike former partners, but you are claiming she should be an entirely different person because you don\u2019t like who she actually is, and feeling betrayed when she does not obey. She\u2019s lucky to have left. Doctors should not prescribe your partner medicine without your say-so? What? My first peak trans moment came with the forcing of the label \u2018cis woman.\u2019 What would you prefer? \u201cWomen, and trans women\u201d? \u201cCis woman\u201d is only necessary to distinguish from trans women- normally \u201cwoman\u201d is perfectly fine for both. Thank God for \u201cpeak trans\u201d- these TERFs will make women trans-friendly because of their extremism.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 28 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
