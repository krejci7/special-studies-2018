You may be angry and frightened, but it is not about you. You can calmly and rationally care for your child. You need to consider what to do: angry outbursts are counter-productive. Avoid anyone who encourages an angry response. There is suppressed rage in every word of 4thwavenow. She is revolted at the thought of transition, and oblivious to any validity in my opposing view: one comment says the psychiatrists \u201care writing their own paycheck\u201d as if that makes them corrupt, and opposed to the interests of their patients; and \u201cDear God, we must rally the sane people to stand with us\u201d. This is not \u201cskepticism\u201d, this is denialism. Because of the upside-down activist-driven reality we live in today, rather than helping gender dysphoric young people come to terms with their healthy young bodies, Dr. Olson-Kennedy and her colleagues socially transition children to believe they are the opposite sex.\u00a0\u00a0 She claims to know better than the medical experts, who she thinks are driven by activists. When I transitioned, I said to a friend, \u201cMost women get a great deal of pleasure from a penis\u201d. She replied, \u201cYes, but I would not want one of my own\u201d. I would not want one, either. Can you imagine presenting for a week as the other sex? If the idea revolts you, ask why it delights your child. She supports \u201creparative therapy\u201d for trans children, but not for gay people, whom she says are healthy. I agree; but the \u201ctherapists\u201d do not, and objectively gay people are less able to form a stable heterosexual partnership, conceive and bring up a child. She is repetitive. In that post, \u201cmass delusion\u201d, \u201cunthinking\u201d, \u201cfalse\u201d, \u201choodwinked\u201d\u2026 This language prevents clear thought about the good of your child. Transgender Reality is anything but that. She is entitled to a policy that comments by transgender people\u00a0that do not take a\u00a0stance critical of \u201cbrain sex\u201d theory and current trans dogma will be rejected, but it does mean you get one side only. I do not support a cult, and have no interest in \u201crecruiting\u201d young people into transition: I want no-one to transition unless they are certain it is right for them. Her falsehoods shut down discussion. She is welcome to comment here should she wish. I look forward to engaging with her Eye of Sauron gravatar. She criticises a particular Reddit. I will have a look at it, and may post on it. Like her, I oppose lying to therapists. But the advice Parents whose children think they are trans: Get them off reddit is out of touch with reality. You cannot keep your child off the internet, but if you listen to your child you will be able to talk with them about what they read. They may understand that lying is counter-productive. I was advised to lie. I did not. I transitioned successfully under medical supervision. If your child wants transition, ask psychiatrists and specialists. It is quite understandable that you may not want your child to transition. You feel scared and protective. Talk over your feelings with supportive friends, but do not visit these sites, which allow no criticism of their extremist position.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 28 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
