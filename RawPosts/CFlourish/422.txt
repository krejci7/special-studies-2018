A trans boy! Katy commented, and her acolyte Pruett led me to this post with hundreds of comments. Lindsay writes that she was a tomboy as a child, and preferred \u201cboy-things\u201d, her friends were boys, but now she is happy as a wife and mother, who likes DIY (\u201cman thing\u201d) as well as nice clothes (\u201cwoman thing\u201d) and therefore shows rigid division into male or female activities or ways of reacting or anything is ridiculous.\u00a0And so is the phenomenon of transsexualism. Then all Katy\u2019s regulars, and hundreds on Lindsay\u2019s post, showed off their writing ability, reasoning skills, empathy and common sense to a greater or lesser extent, all shaking their heads and expatiating on one of two main themes: 1. The parents are monsters, torturing their child for their own nefarious purposes, seeking notoriety perhaps, or being \u201cliberal\u201d, and the child could not possibly imagine herself to be a boy unless tortured by monsters; or 2. The parents are idiots, letting the child follow a silly whim. There is an intermediate position- the child had a silly whim, and the monster-parents are forcing \u201cher\u201d to go through with it, but it all boils down to, \u201cOf course she\u2019s a girl!!! How could it be otherwise? Transition is kooky and wacky and completely wrong and NO GOOD CAN COME OF IT.\u201d Few suggest that the child, the parents, and any other involved adult, are doing their best and might have some idea how best to live their own lives. Katy has met the parents of a trans child, and can accept that the woman she has met might be doing her best, but not the mother she has not met, who is obviously a \u201ctrendy crusade junkie\u201d. Yet I, and thousands of others, go about our normal pursuits, transitioned. Yesterday I mentioned Miriam, and her trans-exclusionist argument. It makes some sense. Some might say it was a valid argument. It appears to hang together. So I say to Miriam\u2019s TERF friend,  I don't care. So she says to me \u201cIn saying that you are a typical trans, an M-T, you insult all women, you insult all women who have ever been victimised by the Patriarchy and you are part of the Patriarchy and you are the tool of the Patriarchy and the weapon of the Patriarchy against all women and you are using the Patriarchy to oppress women and perpetuating Rape Culture\u2026\u201d and I say  I don't care. And I go about my ordinary life, using women\u2019s loos and changing rooms, and going to the lesbian weekend. Bit scared, even though they have said they accept lesbians who are trans women. Still going. It\u2019s all different world views. Take Tim, who has accumulated this vast store of argument to make the Bible literally true and inerrant, and in doing so has ripped out its poetry and metaphor and story. I debated with him far longer than I should have. Too much effort and too little chance of success. We might seem to be using words to communicate and argue logically, but we are not. Not really. He hears mine through his worldview and refutes it to his own satisfaction. There is nothing for me to say but  I don't care. Love and kisses to all. May God bless you and keep you and make God\u2019s face to shine upon you, and give you peace. ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 43 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
