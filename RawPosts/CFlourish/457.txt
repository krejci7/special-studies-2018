In 1998, I saw a consultant who wrote to my GP, \u201cMr Languish is not transsexual\u201d. He is clearly wrong, in hindsight: I have been transitioned ten years. He put back my transition at least three years, and that harmed me. Could he really not have spotted that I am trans, had he not been unduly prejudiced against the possibility? In 2001, I saw a gender psychiatrist. This was 8 months after my GP\u2019s referral, which is an abnormally short delay. He made no diagnosis of gender dysphoria, and told me that I could not get hormones until after I had changed my name: that is, after I had taken the plunge, gone full time as female. Separately from those decisions, the consultation made me so upset that I could not bear to see him again, and went private. I wanted reassurance that I could make a go of transition, and support in doing so: voice training, facial hair removal, hormones. He gave me nothing. So I went to Russell Reid, who gave hormones, I found a speech therapist and electrologist, and transitioned. Of these doctors, it was Reid who was investigated and found guilty of serious professional misconduct. He retired. He sold his practice to Richard Curtis, who now is also up before the GMC with similar complaints. Far more people are hurt by refusal of treatment than by wrong treatment. But the ones hurt by refusal don\u2019t matter. They are only trannies, after all. The important thing for the doctors is to avoid anyone for whom the treatment is wrong, getting it. And for the media: \u201ctranny refused treatment\u201d is not a story, probably not a real tranny anyway- but cutting the breasts off someone who later objects is a hugely salacious story. Any psychiatrist should be capable of diagnosing my condition: it is easily described. But we must be referred to gender psychiatrists. I do not know why people revert. I was capable of making my own decision, I knew I would be permanently changed and infertile, and I had no psychosis or other condition which might make me falsely believe I was trans. So Dr Dalrymple told me. I did not know I could make a go of it but I knew I had to try. The two questions: Am I transsexual? Will I be happier if I transition? may have the answers yes- no. If you revert, there may be huge pressure to find reasons why transition was wrong in the first place. One I know who could not afford to go private transitioned before me, and may have her operation this year, ten years later. No. That is not shocking at all. It is only strange in that she is actually getting her operation. I hate the salacious, prurient Telegraph article, especially in giving Curtis\u2019 former name and the area he lives in; but it reveals he is \u201cnon-homosexual\u201c. One of my lot.
