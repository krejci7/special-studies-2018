You are immediately aware of your needs, and state them. You are made happy when your needs are met. You express your feelings when you feel them. Then you are moulded and socialised. Some things are not OK, and are restricted with labels, or names- \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d, and more specific words. \u201cStupid\u201d. \u201cLazy\u201d. We need to be socialised. We are part of a society and cannot live well on our own. We pick up labels from our parents then the wider society. Labels can be used best for the good of all including us. Other labels are used for the good of the dominant individuals, or for the group but not for the individual labeled. Ostracism is the most terrible punishment. A label like \u201cawkward teenager\u201d might goad a person into trying harder. You seek to fit in. With practice, you actually do. You find you like it. Or, it is too much and you find a label to free you from that coercion. I am an \u201cintrovert\u201d, you say: not bad, not less than others, but with different desires and gifts. You do not need to crave the label \u201cparty animal\u201d which always seems out of reach. Labels can liberate. I am \u201cintrovert\u201d, so it is OK for me to feel or behave this way. I am an \u201cintrovert\u201d, so behaving that way will be genuinely difficult for me. It is not \u201cmy fault\u201d and it does not mean I am less than others. I will find difficulty, and still it may be worth my while practising behaving that way. Labels control, goad, punish. Sometimes they get someone to behave in a different way, and sometimes they simply immiserate them- incorrigible, incapable, I hide away. And labels liberate. Saying I am \u201ctranssexual\u201d allowed me to do and feel as trans women do. Labels can help me learn to navigate society. I am socialised in a particular way, coerced and constrained by labels, and other labels permitted me to be. Feeling that is OK because I am X. Wanting that is OK because I am Y. Others are not like that, so feel and desire differently. Labels which liberate can still constrain: my understanding of \u201cintrovert\u201d can make me imagine myself differently from my true nature. At best, I can understand myself without words, and then create the words to understand better. The words are a scaffolding to build understanding, yet for freedom I must be willing to build higher. Possibly I have no \u201ctrue nature\u201d, I am a creature of words, in society, moulded by others and by the ideas I take in through words. Possibly I have an essence or being in some things and not others; but possibly I cannot know. That in me which others have most desired and enforced might be the part of me which I most cling on to, terrified of their sanctions. Of course it is Real Me! Sometimes the words fall away, and like in infancy I simply am. Aware of my needs, desires and feelings, I do what I do without conscious analysis, flowing like water, following the Tao. Yet still I use words, to communicate with people on the other side of the world. People here I can communicate with more directly, and yet still use words to communicate as I have learned to. More learning is possible. Sometimes I choose a picture particularly for a post, sometimes I just go through a series of pictures with little relevance to a post, and sometimes going through my series I happen upon a picture which fits perfectly.
