I avoid actions, and ways of being or responding, because of disapproval in the past which no longer exists. I acted, I sensed another\u2019s disapproval, I absorbed the judgment that I should not act that way, I internalised the judgment that I, my instincts and actions, were wrong. Internalised transphobia is internalised self-phobia. Even if the judgment is my own, and no-one else\u2019s, it still paralyses me. There is a deep well of rage inside of me. Rage about how I as an individual have been treated\u2026; rage about how others I know have been treated; and rage about the conditions that I\u2019m sure affect many women and minorities, \u2026 and have caused many others to leave. Well, my own rage is there, but fruitless: I still am fearful of certain expressions, and the fear holds me down. I am depressed and lacking motivation. The rage could be energy for action, but my own judgment holds it down. Women live in a society that presents as \u201cnatural\u201d what they experience as arbitrary constraints. This can provide them with a particular sensitivity to injustices that are due less to individual ill will than to the structures of established practices and institutions. And I don\u2019t. I accept the judgment on my femininity as weak and as less than masculinity, not an arbitrary constraint but the natural order of things, not historically constructed social categories. I find the quotes in italics, about feminist philosophy, here. That feminist understanding of her own worth is an attitude I could learn from. The elephant could break the chain on its ankle easily, but remembering infancy when it could not, it imagines the chain as effective a restraint as it was then. My chain only exists in my imagination, but a chain there is strong. This is the answer to the allegation that trans women have male privilege. The feminist says that my upbringing, encouraging me to act assertively, should benefit me. I argue, against that, that their internal qualities, allowing them to reject the arbitrary constraints on them, place them in a better position to be themselves and overcome the structural injustice. I could not assert myself, only assert a masculine act, which tortured me and which eventually I fled from. Beside that masculinity which society values, my femininity seemed weak and worthless, even to me. We project our own judgments onto others. Others may read our lack of self-confidence and downgrade their judgment of us. So I am paralysed in acting. That article quoted a definition of \u201cwoman\u201d- S is a woman [if and only if] S is systematically subordinated along some dimension \u2014 economic, political, legal, social \u2014 and S is \u2018marked\u2019 as a target for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female\u2019s biological role in reproduction. I am systematically subordinated, at least. Or maybe I would be a woman if I passed as a woman rather than a trans woman. Because our oppression is so different, I could sympathise with a feminist caring more about hers than mine, or even not seeing mine as oppression. Presence may be the answer. I still the critical voices in my head, and act from a single volition rather than my conflicted state. Others suffer from Imposter syndrome, and still act. Living in Presence does not mean not setting goals or seeking to achieve them, but being present to one\u2019s atelic activities. \u201cAtelic\u201d means non-goal related, from Greek \u201ctelos\u201d, purpose, I read here. One might also be present to telic activities. One might develop self-confidence, I theorise.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 8 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
