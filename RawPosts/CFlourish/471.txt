It hurts Now. On Saturday, it was too hot to dance with my wig on. Even before we started dancing, the school was too warm- so I took my wig off, and tied a scarf round my head- and it was too hot for that. People I had never met before got to see the male pattern baldness. It is one thing to be read as trans, but that- is as if I am not really trying to appear female. Which I am. I do not want to look like a man half dressed up. Lots of women want to \u201clook their best\u201d and the sense that they do not is cruel to them- and it is particularly cruel to me. I have seen the fear on the faces of women who have not got their foundation on. And lots of people feel they \u201cdo not fit in\u201d, and I really, really don\u2019t. I wanted more to fit in with my mother\u2019s expectations, her conservative ideas, than my peers at school. Usually a child picks up his accent from his classmates, but I got mine from my mother. (Cormac Murphy-O\u2019Connor, raised in England, is another example.) My sister spoke a different accent at home from at school, and when I visited her in Edinburgh and she met me at the bus station a nursing student friend said, \u201cS, you\u2019ve got your English accent on,\u201d the one she used to phone her parents. So I created a Shell, a rationalist persona to fit in, and held my rage and terror out of consciousness. \u201cWhy is my life so hard?\u201d sang Paul Simon. Yes, yes, I know. And- \u201cWho will be my r\u00f4le model?\u201d Always difficult, but the obvious ones for me were men, and they did not fit at all. I hated many people, for they were\u00a0wrong too. It still feels a bit weird picking a female role model. I was aware of other transvestites in my twenties, and they were furtive and persecuted, and rightly so for they were disgusting. Chief Constable James Anderton had them arrested, when they went out in public. Watching telly together, in our teens, I said, \u201cOh look, a man in a dress. What do you think of that?\u201d And my sister said, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anything more disgusting. That turns me right off.\u201d I am neither.  I am terrified. Lana Wachowski is that role-model, for younger lesbian! TSs, hat tip to Mindy. There is a negotiated path, of transition. It takes determination and courage, and two years or so after taking the plunge one is awarded with a Gender Recognition Certificate, which says \u201cThe above named person is, from the date of issue, of the gender shown\u201d. So if I \u201cmarry\u201d it has to be a man, I could make a \u201ccivil partnership\u201d with a woman, and those M-Fs old enough to have a different retirement age get the woman\u2019s. And if people object to me in the women\u2019s loos, the law is on my side. And- being a \u201cwoman\u201d does not entirely fit me either, though it is a great deal more comfortable than being a \u201cman\u201d. I am neither.
