We gain sympathy, and the TERFs and conservatives don\u2019t. We lose on logic. \u201cPiss off, you\u2019re a man\u201d they say, and keep reiterating. One TERF identifies as a MERF (Go on, guess-) they are talking of TIMs, trans-identified males, and M-T, male to trans rather than male to female. If a trans woman spends too much time with their websites and twitter accounts, and not with affirmation in the mainstream press from the likes of, say, Margaret Atwood, they can get wearing. I take encouragement from their desperation: But they\u2019re men! Men! Men in women\u2019s washrooms! They just get ignored. \u201cTrans women are women\u201d say female Labour MPs, and here\u2019s Angela Rayner MP, who has an inspiring life story and is just pure dead brilliant: We are also calling on the Government to reform the Gender Recognition Act and the Equality Act 2010 to change the protected characteristic of \u201cgender reassignment\u201d to \u201cgender identity\u201d to provide proper protection for trans people. Margaret Atwood, feminist: It is always \u2013 \u2018What do you mean by the word?\u2019 For instance, some feminists have historically been against lipstick and letting transgender women into women\u2019s washrooms. Those are not positions I have agreed with. We generate empathy. This is who I am. This is what I wanted, more than anything else in the world. This wins hearts, and where the heart is with us the mind will find a way. Cold rationality has nothing on sympathetic emotion. This morning I fell off my bicycle again. I hate that road, narrow and busy, with a narrow path by the side that cyclists are permitted to use, which is potholed and muddy. I skidded in a muddy puddle, bent the supports of my mudguard, possibly knocked my derailleur out of alignment and the chain came off. And after, every motorist that passed me without courtesy, just a foot away, without care for my safety, shocked and angered me. So, I don\u2019t get propositioned, cat-called and touched up in the street. And I can sympathise absolutely with a woman who, having suffered a particularly egregious example, dodged into a toilet and was angry and shocked to see a trans woman. Normally it would be bearable but in that particular situation it was not. There, I have given you two examples where the slings and arrows of quotidian irritation might become too much, and perhaps you can supply your own. I feel if TERFs said, I saw this trans woman in the loo and it creeped me out, it was too much for me after what I had endured that day, they might win more people over. But instead they say, men in women\u2019s clothes, whether trans women or not, might be a threat; and everyone knows they are exaggerating; and trans women cannot be blamed for people pretending to be trans women. And if one said, I have given birth, I love my body, it is a woman\u2019s body doing what a woman\u2019s body does, and I loathe the simulacrum of a woman that is a trans woman- that might work too, though love of your own physicality need not mean despising someone else\u2019s, nor excluding that person. So they are reduced to calling us perverts, even paedophiles. It won\u2019t work. Hate never does.   This #LGBTHistoryMonth @dawnbutlerbrent , @angelarayner, @parislees and @iandylanthomas reflect on the victories Labour and the LGBT community achieved together, and those we\u2019ll keep fighting for.
