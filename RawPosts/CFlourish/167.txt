Her suggestion for an adjective for \u201cmen\u2019s films\u201d is a pure delight. I realized the problem began with the fact that adjectives are mostly required of the less powerful. Thus, there are \u201cnovelists\u201d and \u201cfemale novelists,\u201d \u201cAfrican-American doctors\u201d but not \u201cEuropean- American doctors,\u201d \u201cgay soldiers\u201d but not \u201cheterosexual soldiers,\u201d \u201ctransgender activists\u201d but not \u201ccisgender activists.\u201d Ooh! A feminist mentioning trans in a way which does not seem completely hostile. The article is not about trans, but about oppression, and it has a list of oppressed groups at one point, and one of those oppressed groups are trans folk. Thank you, Gloria Steinem. Wow, Gloria Steinem, in the pantheon of Feminist Pioneer Intellectuals, being nice about trans people. It almost makes up for a certain Australian intellectual being horrible. The article is not about trans. It mentions homophobia too, and I think it is wrong about that, quoting a playwright: if we look at all real homophobia, it\u2019s anti-feminism. It\u2019s really misogyny dressed up, or pointed at men. No, it is anti-feminine. Not all women are feminine, and many men are, and this is a good thing, oppressively policed by femmephobia. Feminism has to be for the harridan as well as the feminine. I first noticed this in an article by Eve Ensler, author of The Vagina Monologues. I can\u2019t remember what it was about, now, but it mentioned trans in a positive way as an aside. Something like they\u2019re women too and they have a hard time. I had read a radical feminist critique of this, and it poisoned my understanding. The rad-fem said that she only says that because she is terrified of the all-consuming power of the Trans Activists!!!!! who will ruin her career unless she is a cringing, fawning lick-spittle to them. I had definitely been reading too much TERF stuff. Gloria Steinem, with a huge list of awards and honours including several \u201cmost important or influential woman\u201d appreciations and a Doctorate of Human Justice, is above that. It is merely true that women, people of colour, gay people and trans people have less power than men, white people, straight and cis people. In 1977, Dr Steinem expressed concern about sex reassignment surgery, concern which I share. In my own case, I thought I wanted my body altered, where I now believe I really felt that having my body altered made me part of an acceptable category of feminine men, and I wanted to be acceptable. Explaining her stance in 2013, she said We need to change society to fit individuals, which is my current position. It would then be clear why people wanted genital alteration, and those who still wanted it could have it. I believe that transgender people, including those who have transitioned, are living out real, authentic lives. Those lives should be celebrated, not questioned. Their health care decisions should be theirs and theirs alone to make. Trans folk disagree about surgery. It is deeply emotive. It should be our discussion, first- not the doctors\u2019, and not wider society\u2019s, but ours, our theory, understanding, choices and ideological struggle. And Gloria Steinem is an ally against the femme-phobia. Gloria Steinem, What about men?   ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 17 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
