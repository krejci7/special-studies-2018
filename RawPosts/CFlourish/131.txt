Very odd, for where is the threat? Good question, which trans folk are uniquely well placed to answer, often conforming until we stop, and become our real selves. The threat is to my identity. When I put on an identity I invested a great deal in it. It has overcome many impulses and feelings which I suppressed out of consciousness, because they terrified me. I still have that fear- \u201cThe monster will get me\u201d- it is an existential threat, because I feared the withdrawal of my mother\u2019s love at the moment I could not survive without it. That fear is hard to grow out of, even though I am now adult. So the identity, as a \u201cman\u201d, was me, safe and protected, and losing it would be becoming naked and vulnerable. This is terrifying. For others, the threat might come from their age group, growing up. If you like X you are no longer one of the in crowd. Then there is the difficulty of admitting you were wrong. So much of your life has been wasted. This is terribly difficult. When we assert something our self-respect and self-belief become involved. You might be rescued by others who do not conform. You realise that there is no point in conformity after all, and you have tortured yourself into conformity for nothing. It is painful to realise you have wasted so much of your life and potential, so you may just snap back into denial. Yet if you can accept that lesson you can become free. This is a slow process. I looked at myself in the mirror as I cleansed and moisturised, and thought, I like myself. I frustrate myself a bit. No, I frustrate myself a lot, but I grow to like myself. This is taking me years. I am frustrated with my slow progress, and pleased with my progress. For trans folk, the difference between the conforming, adopted false self and the underlying real self is so great that we cannot continue with the process of denial. The benefit is becoming integrated, becoming one. Rather than the competing demands of real self and false identity pulling me in opposite directions, I pull in just one. My feelings can overwhelm me, but I am not so much spending energy on suppressing them, and they do not so much nag at the corner of my consciousness until they can be acknowledged. I feel the feeling. I know what I need. I work to get it. Increasingly, I flow towards it, the integrated self doing what is needed without all this analysis.
