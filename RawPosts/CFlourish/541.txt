 At one point, I could not have attended a women’s group. Now there is no problem. I was utterly delighted in 2003 when the Quaker Women’s Group agreed that anyone who “experienced herself as a woman” could attend. However, I am never again going to moan that I was told “big boys don’t cry” from the age of four. At least I was never told it is unfeminine, and therefore bad in me, to express anger. As I said, my mantra was, “These are ordinary decent people minding their own business”. And now, I have improved it. Now it is, “These are beautiful, wonderful people, being and doing”. There is no need to fear any of them. Not one. Oh, and: I used to say, “Everything’s gonna be alright”, but that is not quite it either. “Everything is alright.”
