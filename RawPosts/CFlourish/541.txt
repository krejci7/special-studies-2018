If you are over 5\u20196\u2033 or your hip to waist ratio is less than 1.4, it has probably happened to you at least once; but we are the only ones who, when we politely explain there is a mistake, are regularly disbelieved. Once, oh happy memory, I was reverse-read. There I was in jacket and tie and trench coat, going to the other office. As I left the bus, I sang out \u201cthank you\u201d in a light voice, and the busdriver said \u201cOrright Love\u201d then looked round and said, \u201cSorry, mate\u201d. I walked off floating on air. And once, when presenting male, I visited a friend, and afterwards her ten year old son asked her, \u201cWas that a woman?\u201d Today, four women were talking loudly about wigs. This did not necessarily refer to me, but it might have done.\u00a0My friend thought this showed success: if they comment on your wig, they would comment on your being T if they noticed it. And I do not think it meant they would have noticed it was a wig, but for the fact that they saw me leaving the wig shop. I would rather be able to grow my own hair, but feel less moved to whinge about my wigs than some people whinge about their hair, so am happy enough with wearing wigs. I liked the new one\u00a0when I put it on, and it\u2019s really growing (!) on me. I am delighted that the World Professional Association for Transgender Health has decided that gender non-conformity is not a \u201cdisorder\u201d. It is just part of the natural diversity of human beings. Their new standards of care are discussed\u00a0and excerpted\u00a0here. I have known that I am not mad for years, but I am glad the professionals have at last admitted it. ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 55 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
