Can you tell which is the dominant one, and which is the passive one?\u201d This is a\u00a0heterosexual way of looking at it which does not fit all heterosexuals. My friend described how he had relationships in which he was more active, and others in which he was more passive, and he could feel the erogenous zones in his body change as his relationships did. A gay friend has said that some gay men do not particularly like anal intercourse,\u00a0refuting the dominant/ passive paradigm. And I\u00a0doubt\u00a0you could look at a gay couple,\u00a0judge which of them was more \u201cfeminine\u201d, and from that deduce which was more dominant. A wife in\u00a0\u201cPeveril of the Peak\u201d manages her husband beautifully, always letting him get his own way if he insists in the small things, and always persuading him in the large things. The same gay man, from his observations, said that when\u00a0two blokes fancy each other, their eyes meet and they consent together immediately. Whereas two women could dance around each other for months before coming together. Others could see where they were going, perhaps they could too, but they took an unconscionable time. Transsexual people can form very strong bonds in the difficulty and delight of transition, from an understanding of each other which few others share. To connect with someone who has that understanding is a great blessing. ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 53 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
