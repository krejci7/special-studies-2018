This is the I Love you sign. I met U by the urn when I went to make coffee. I touched the kettle with my wrist, burning it slightly- halfwit- but did not want to interrupt the interaction. -Give us a hug. She will not, because I have asked in that way. It is like an order, a claim, and she does not respond well to orders. -But it is just a way of speaking, I would not order you- No buts.\u00a0Even though she would like a hug, she will not share one unless I rephrase. Oh, OK. -May I have a hug? We hug. We have long hugs in this group generally, but U and I have particularly long hugs. I cannot remember what we were talking about, but she objected to something I said, and tapped me lightly on the back of the head. -You hit me! -It was a love-tap. This time I will not let it go. You can\u2019t just hit people! And neither will she. It was a love-tap. It was completely unobjectionable. I went off to cry in the bunkhouse- where I met S, who listened and cared and shared, and then S came and looked after us both. I did a share in the large group. I am not here, I said, to have a relaxing weekend with friends. I am here to experience intense human interaction so I can get better at it. It takes courage for me to be here. Up go the hands, in the I Love you sign.\u00a0Lots of hands.\u00a0I chortle delightedly, indicating them. -Ha! A full set!! The day before was a Goddess workshop taster, and I got Kuan Yin, Bodhisattva of compassion. The picture I had was simpler, even prettier and more feminine. Speaking in the group, I felt self-conscious in speaking in a very high voice, and saying that\u00a0I had met her, and she had put her white robe on me. And it felt right. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed,\u201d said Anna. \u201cAll the anger has gone from you.\u201d   \u2665\u2665\u2665 I emailed U, saying \u201cI ask your kindness. I do not feel you were kind to me this morning.\u201d I dare to say that this, and my preferring to stroke Talking Tom than hit him, and other reactions, are \u201cfeminine\u201d. Can you imagine how much hurt and baggage I have around that? I have called it weakness. Remembering the example of Thomas Hardy\u2019s character Christian Cantle, who was weak, stupid and cowardly and called these characteristics the virtue of Christian Meekness, I am wary of naming a weakness or vice as a virtue or positive characteristic. I tried to make a man of myself for 34 years, which took me to ridiculous places- a court solicitor who hates conflict, forsooth! Still I am wary of being this feminine, which feels so achingly vulnerable. And the Radfems would leap on it, saying I have no right to say what is \u201cfeminine\u201d, the word is Patriarchal and I am an Oppressor. Being who I am is so wrong, in so many ways! The compliment which has delighted me most over the last forty years is, \u201cYou can be serious, but underneath it all you are a joyful, playful child\u201d. This weekend, I have amended that: I am a joyful, playful adult. I am feminine. Please tell me it is alright for me to call myself \u201cfeminine\u201d! That burn was superficial, two days later the redness is nearly gone. And- it was in the shape of a heart, on my wrist. ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 49 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
