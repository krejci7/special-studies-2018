I knew what manliness was, how I should be, what was right and wrong, how the world worked or ought to work. A friend said in her teens she was looking at everything, trying to work out how it fitted, but I was quite sure. And there was this shameful thing which did not fit, so I rejected it. I cross-dressed, but that was not me, or involved in how I understood anything. But it would not go away. It was the loose thread, which I kept pulling, and it turned my world inside out. The rejection of everything I valued was traumatic. I am lying on the floor weeping, repeating \u201cI am not a man\u201d. There is something I know to be true, even though it contradicts everything which makes me feel safe, even though it terrifies me. \u201cI am not a man\u201d. Then I devoted all my energies to making transition happen. I find it hard to claim any good quality, but I am learning. I am intelligent. I am expressive. I am good with words. People tell me these things repeatedly, I find lots of supportive evidence, I have come to believe them. One person said, in delighted admiration, \u201cYou have fantastic emotional intelligence\u201d and that has stuck with me, and also seems backed up with the evidence. I have emotional intelligence. I would not have believed it, when trying to make a man of myself. I have difficulty asserting \u201cI am a woman\u201d. I would say, \u201cI am not a man\u201d, \u201cI want to transition\u201d, even \u201cI am transsexual\u201d. \u201cI am Clare\u201d. Possibly I don\u2019t need to say that I am a woman, or believe it, just this is the way I express myself. I fear contradiction. It was the thread I pulled, and expressing female seems like real me underneath the stifling convention, all that learned behaviour, learned understanding, useless concepts of manhood and virtue. But I have not created an alternative world view, just partial, contingent understandings. And especially while transitioning but also since I have sometimes had the feeling of being completely at sea, having no understanding- the fact that I sense or believe something is no evidence for or against its truth or falsehood of knowing nothing at all. It is disorienting, terrifying, nauseating. In a world where Mr Trump is busy destroying the shared values and understanding of truth, this may be an advantage. These people believe the opposite of me- well, that has always been the case. I know how disorienting it can be to lose Truth as an anchor. Possibilities remain, and you have to be satisfied with that. And Truth has mattered to me. It is true- transition is right for me. I am trans. I worried away at it- could it just be a fantasy or perversion, but it is not just that. Yet- it is important to me not to need anything to be true- I am a woman!- because it could be snatched from me at any time.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 19 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
