He had had a chaotic\u00a0 life, addicted to skunk, living in squats, TWOCking for money or fun, and now\u00a0 he had a job and was going through college. At another, I met a man who hinted at a violent background such that I did not want any more details. And here he\u00a0 was, with those of us seeking enlightenment, the highest Good, the Good Life,\u00a0 God, whatever, seeking alongside me. And he said to me, \u201cI grew up in the\u00a0 plague zone, and I caught the plague\u201d. I do not think he was trying to exculpate himself, or excuse\u00a0 his acts. I think he was stating a fact, that the sins of the fathers are visited\u00a0 upon the Children- not because God is vengeful, just because that is the way it\u00a0 is- and that people can escape it, with luck or synchronicity, as he had. In a\u00a0 bad situation, people do bad things, and that does not make them bad people. We\u00a0 are all doing our best, some of us under difficult circumstances. When my friend said she would prostitute herself, I begged\u00a0 her not to, and she said she had no money. I actually drove her to the pick-up\u00a0 joint. The paedophile had a key ring, with four fobs on it, each with a picture\u00a0 of a child\u2019s face, and I could not bear to look at it. Then I asked him, \u201cWhat\u00a0 do you want from me?\u201d He said, \u201cI want you to make it so I don\u2019t have to fear\u00a0 any more,\u201d and my heart opened to him. All of us have the potential for growth. All of us have\u00a0 something of God within us. Any one of us may step forward on the path to\u00a0 enlightenment. Notes I love the Alternatives to Violence Project, which runs\u00a0 courses all around the UK, across the world, and particularly in prisons, where\u00a0 people learn by experience constructive ways of resolving conflict. There,\u00a0 douce middle-class people like me can meet with people caught up in the\u00a0 criminal justice system and the family courts, and grow together.
