There\u2019s nothing difficult about that hill, with reasonable gears. \u201cYou must be really fit then,\u201d she said, and I realised how proud I am of it, how it delights me striding along in top gear. There is not much I feel proud of. The next day someone in cycling gear rather than jeans and a t shirt overtook me easily. He was probably going further than me, too, and not necessarily much younger. Oh well, my jeans and t shirt label me not a Serious Cyclist, and yet I am still proud. I got to my friend\u2019s house in the dark, hoping to change into my pretty frock. She was running late, and her garden is not overlooked so I put my light on a chair and changed and made up. Then she said she was more than half an hour away, so I went to the pub to keep warm. -Haven\u2019t seen you in here before. We got chatting. He used to work in the shoe factory in Marsby. Very little shoemaking in the county now, I say. My turn. I\u2019m going to the Opera. They don\u2019t believe me. Where\u2019s that then? I tell them of that concert, and they say there\u2019s no church in Dell. So we get our phones out. \u201cSet up- say \u2018yes google'\u201d says my screen. Oh, why should it be so complex? Why should my location be continually known to the phone company, Google, facebook, whoever? \u201cWas that what you meant?\u201d asks another man, who finds that the concerts are usually in the Manor-house. Yes, but I know the difference between a church and a manor-house: one room is most of the building and you can see the roof from inside. Though I give up explaining. My friend had worried about going in there in case anyone thought she wanted to get picked up. I am still worried about going into pubs in case I am abused as trans- but actually I was uncomfortable there, because I am an Outsider. Don Pasquale by Donizetti was performed by Opera Minima, four singers and a pianist, and a silent Maid whose hammy facial expressions were hilarious. I spent most of the second half feeling complete delight, loving the voices, harmonies, tunes, and the English translation which rhymed, scanned, made sense and was singable.
