I have been commenting on a blog for three years, and it was a shock when she came out as TERF. I don\u2019t like that phrase: I don\u2019t agree with all radical feminists say, but some of it is worthwhile. Some people are feminists, some find that just too hard, and instead become obsessive trans-excluders. It could be trans-excluding rubbish \u201cfeminists\u201d, I suppose. Or trans-erasing ridiculous fantasists. The title of her post included the word \u201cpretendbian\u201d, because if a trans woman is gynephile she can\u2019t be a lesbian. Oh, no, the straights oppose that, supporting the lesbians. It went downhill from there: I don\u2019t support a transwoman (sic) standing as women\u2019s officer We\u2019ve moved on from WATM to WATTW. It\u2019s still male privilege assigned at birth pushing the agenda. All result of the Me-me-me-I\u2019m-a winner-and-always-right-and-I\u2019ve-decided-this-is-right-so-you\u2019re-wrong-and-terrible-person group? Caitlyn Jenner broke my shriveled feminist heart. Not because she was on the cover, but because that image, a woman in lingerie, was what she put out there as what being a woman meant to her. Claiming to be a lesbian is a joke when males try it on, whatever they happen to be wearing. Were I a woman student I would not want a man in a dress representing me. And then a real denizen of the rabbit-hole comes on:  You do realize that transactivists support males raping lesbians because they are right up there with the right wingers on science denying and conformity to gender roles? Oh, God. You know a real TERF by the rape allegations. Anyone else is just playing at it. A straight person who met a lot of people might meet a couple of dozen trans folk in a lifetime. They don\u2019t meet any more than that unless they work in a gender clinic. What can we do about this abuse? Turn the other cheek, really. We can\u2019t fight back, there are too few of us. If we argue, they get more and more aggressive and deluded. So ignore the \u201cman in a dress\u201d or \u201cpretendbian\u201d jibes, and if you hear a rape allegation get out of the way. This is what I have learned when someone I thought a friend starts spewing this bile. I have had a relationship with a lesbian. Because of this, others wanted to exclude her from the Northern Older Lesbians\u2019 Group. The word \u201clesbian\u201d matters to me far less than the relationship. It was warm and beautiful. The term \u201ccotton ceiling\u201d, coined by a foolish cis ally, had little currency among trans folk but has become a symbol for the TERFs of how vile we are. It is a little wearing when someone is terribly keen to repeat that they would never ever in a million years have sex with a person like me, but, you know, there are other fish in the sea. I doubt I would argue them into it. We trans women are ridiculous. Often, we don\u2019t look particularly good in our floral dresses. Our body-shape is wrong for many of the clothes we wear. Unless you want your scalp peeled back then a motorised grinder sanding your skull away your face probably won\u2019t be that pretty. Someone who has met a few trans folk gets able to read us. All we can do is embrace that. Ceasing to fear being ridiculous is freedom.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 30 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
