It is lovely to cycle in a light summer dress, but not at night in the rain, so I put on my waterproof jacket. That\u2019s quite hot, and I don\u2019t want my wig rained on, so I put it in my handbag. What could go wrong? I expect to take about forty minutes at night. It is lovely with the roads so quiet, even against the wind, even after such a storm that there is a lot of standing water on the road. I am almost home when there is a barrier across the road, with a police car behind it, and a diversion sign. Oh dear. That\u2019s a long way round, I think. I asked the police officer, politely, if I could get through as it was such a long way. No: the storm has brought down power cables, which are lying right across the road. They have called for someone to come and remove them, but don\u2019t know when they will come. I could wait if I want, but it could be half an hour. I go down the side road. When I get to the dual carriageway I see there is no ramp down leading westward. I had forgotten. As it is quiet, I go down the footpath beside the exit ramp. However when I get to the bottom I see there is a barrier across this road too, again with a man in a van to prevent anyone sneaking through. -Do you mind if I cycle through? It\u2019s a long way round, I am not sure of the way through Zhuzhkov and the road through Marsby is blocked. -Yeah, go on, mate, he says, just mind out when the lorries are reversing, yeah? -I\u2019m female, I say, but he makes no response to that. At one point I am cycling over hot tarmac, enjoying its rich aroma. At another I pull into the side to let a lorry reverse past. Again it is lovely in the quiet, with almost no traffic going the other way. The wind is against me but not too much. There is little drizzle. I slog up the hill from the roundabout and get home in about twice the time I thought it would take. The more people there are about, the more likely it is that someone will read me and object to me, but most people don\u2019t mind. This bloke, seeing my male pattern baldness and hearing my voice, nevertheless behaved reasonably. I have been thinking about pride. What did I do- how would I conceptualise it? I begged to be allowed through\u2013 no, I asked, with my tone of voice indicating the only reasonable course would be allowing me through. Or, pride in appearance- practicality is more important. The dress was comfortable, in the day-time. I met with setbacks and dealt with them.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 12 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
