How? The range of tolerated gender expression for cis women is wide. If I never wear makeup or skirts, is it enough? There are cis women who don\u2019t. I am thinking about what I say rather than how I present, and my voice pitch drops- do I have always to mind my voice? Or if I always wear skirts, high heels and make-up I may be called \u201ca ridiculous caricature of a woman\u201d- \u201cNo-one is as feminine as that\u201d. What a performance gender is, writes a cross-dresser in The Guardian, with pictures from the 1880s to the 1980s. Do I have to wear my wig all the time? A friend wore one, even in bed, as she could not bear to look at herself in the mirror in the morning with her bald head. Either you lie very still while asleep, or that quickly ruins a wig. I live as a woman. My clothes are from women\u2019s clothes shops, I pay some attention to my voice, I use a woman\u2019s name. And, I cycle in a helmet but no wig, and go into the small shop in Marsby in that helmet. It\u2019s pink, with a floral pattern. I never try to pass as a man, though I am seen as one. That must be part of it- I am in good faith. Certainly at the time I affirmed the statutory declaration I had that intention. Fair minded people who imagined the phrase was not impossibly constraining would probably give me a pass mark. That is, anyone might deny it if they wished. Yet I use a woman\u2019s name, a female gender-marker- the title \u201cMiss\u201d. I use women\u2019s spaces. Requiring anything further means specifying what clothes, or even perhaps jobs, are sufficiently feminine, so the law cannot do it. However, to maintain sufficient public acceptance, I must appear sufficiently feminine in the eyes of enough beholders. \u201cA man,\u201d she said. \u201cA middle-aged man\u201c. \u201cA married man\u201c. \u201cHe\u201c. She looked at me for a reaction, but I am not going to object. I sold the pass the first time I tolerated this, I knew it was not a mistake then. And I sympathise with her, I feel she has been wronged by this trans woman. We are women because we are accepted as women, and we are never accepted as women by everyone. I can\u2019t force anyone to use particular pronouns, and the best I can do is to not overreact or get too upset about it. It is not news to me that I am seen as a man. Withdrawing acceptance because someone has done something you object to is an easy trick. Calling her a \u201cman\u201d is a way of showing contempt, but also a way of controlling us: good trans will be tolerated, bad trans, who do anything someone objects to, will not. Then almost everything I do can be unacceptable, calling down the threat of rejection implicit in \u201che\u201d. And tolerating me in women\u2019s toilets because I have had the operation- that gives people the incentive to have the operation, hoping to be tolerated; yet arguing that trans is wrong because it involves mutilation and lifelong dependence on synthetic hormones- together, those leave no space for us. You are a Man. A man. He. I am not going to let it get to me, I insist, but it is wearing. What do you think it means, to \u201clive as a woman\u201d?  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
