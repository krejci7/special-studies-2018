There is a vast amount of theory around trans people, because we evoke strong reactions: if I describe my operation half the population say, \u201cThat\u2019s interesting\u201d and half cross their legs and\u00a0Wince. Only a tiny minority go, \u201cOhhhh\u201d, and relax completely. So, the muggles\u00a0try to make sense of us. We are less threatening if they imagine they can make sense of us. Some of them make sense of us by explaining precisely why we are deluded or wicked, and these theories can be extremely detailed. And yet, when Lili Elbe transitioned, the theorising served her.\u00a0Magnus Hirschfeld\u00a0agreed, and had to \u201cexplain\u201d what was going on, to justify their acts: and the result was to enable, not to prevent, her transition. It does not matter that others came afterwards\u00a0and said, only people exactly like her should be able to transition, because other theorisers said, well, other people need to transition too. I have read that even Ray Blanchard is an enabler, that he supported transition, even if we might not like his theories. I love Hirshfeld\u2019s motto, \u201cJustice through science\u201d. Harry Enfield nailed the knowall who tells other people how to live their lives in the 1980s. People, generally, do our best under difficult circumstances. If you see someone doing something you would not do yourself, ask yourself\u00a0if it really harms anyone, really. Really? Then ask yourself why they might, and give the answer, because they want to. If they want your help, they will ask for it. ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 50 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
