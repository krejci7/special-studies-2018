Women do. Well, obviously. They flush away baby wipes and sanitary towels- \u201cwomen\u2019s things\u201d is the formulation the theory uses- which do not break down, unlike loo roll and faeces. I heard this from Mick, and Steph heard it from Dyno-Rod. Steph got very angry, as the high pressure hose which went down the man-hole cover, forced away the blockage, and sprayed a little water on my loo seat and the floor before it, sprayed faeces on her bath, tiles and shower screen. We don\u2019t know who called them out. It wasn\u2019t Primal Scream, the landlord\u2019s agents. I had called the landlord, and heard at 9pm that something had been done when I heard Steph expressing herself forcefully at two men with rubber hoses, who beat a quick retreat. Here is a clear male v female divide, with me on the female side in loyalty and interest. I read Miriam, assigned male at birth, using a female name, who is attracted to men. One often reads such people claiming they are real transsexuals, and we gynephiles are sex perverts- \u201cautogynephilia\u201d is the jargon. However Miriam claims to be autogynephiliac, though she has not been aroused by the thought of herself as female, and regurgitates trans-exclusionist propaganda. In fact she claims to be male, and imagines all trans women are autogynephiliac. Here is her TERF argument why I should not use women\u2019s loos and changing rooms. She claims the word \u201cTERF\u201d is a slur, but trans-exclusionist, or even trans-erasing, is a literal description. Trans women are not women, they are males. Women are not responsible for protecting males from other males. If trans women (males) are allowed into women\u2019s safe spaces, such as loos and changing rooms, this is a safety issue for the cis-women (Miriam the TERF uses the term \u201cfemale\u201d). Trans women are male, therefore dangerous. Well, cis women are a threat in women\u2019s toilets. Trans women generally aren\u2019t. While Miriam\u2019s argument has an appearance of rationality, and will no doubt please transphobes and trans-exclusionists, it does not relate to the real world. Making rules against trans women protects no-one. Why would a sex-offender dress female and lurk around toilets in town centres during the day, when he could dress male and prey on drunken women at night? \u201cWomen are not responsible for protecting males\u201d but women in my experience are generally very happy to accept me in women\u2019s spaces, even lesbian or political women\u2019s spaces. My genuine sympathy with Steph, and scepticism of that male argument, does not by itself prove that I am on the women\u2019s side, but is one small piece of the overwhelming evidence that it is right to treat us as women.
