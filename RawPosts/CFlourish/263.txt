I went to the Gay Village round Canal St. I used the loos. Then I thought I have to go where the straights go, so started to go to the Bridgewater Hall for concerts. Then I went to the supermarket, because I had to be able to do everyday things, if I was to transition. I got a card from the psychiatrist- \u201cClare Flourish is receiving treatment for Gender Dysphoria, and should use women\u2019s toilets\u201d or something- and carried it in my handbag but never needed to use it. Of course trans women who do not pass need to use women\u2019s toilets, or they will have no chance of ever passing. Some blog- google for the quote if you want to read the whole thing- says, By no means do I believe that transgendered people have intentions of HURTING people. I honestly believe they are just people who are hurting. But I also believe that someone who wants to hurt people will stop at nothing to do just that. If a bad woman, claiming to be transgendered, could go into a men\u2019s bathroom and possibly hurt your son, who were in there alone, she would. Because the law gives her that right and takes away your son\u2019s right. In the same, any man could claim to \u201cidentify as a woman\u201d and have unrestricted access to my little girls in the restroom. She knows we are harmless, but still claims allowing us to pee causes some theoretical risk of assault. What assaults? Here is the research. Human rights commissions from Colorado to Connecticut had not heard of such cases. Cries of \u201cWe must Protect Our Children!\u201d are suddenly silenced when the topic of gun violence comes up. Perverts may pretend to be trans, and assault women and girls. But then perverts may lurk in car parks and assault women and girls- or just assault women they know, in their homes and offices. Ted Cruz is far more dangerous than Donald Trump, and his honest beliefs are popular. Scared people get more extreme. Some of the attack on us claims that we are sexually aroused perverts who are an actual danger of voyeurism or assault in toilets, and some of it is that women and girls may feel unsafe around us in toilets, and so their feelings should be protected rather than ours. Even if I am no threat at all, if someone imagines I am she must be protected from me. By physical violence if necessary, says this county sheriff candidate. If my little girl is in a public women\u2019s restroom and a man, regardless of how he may identify, goes into the bathroom, he will then identify as a John Doe until he wakes up in whatever hospital he may be taken to. Seeking election, he calculates this will be popular. It does not matter that we are not dangerous. They \u201cfeel uncomfortable\u201d round us, so they will get violent. They are not ashamed of their irrational prejudice.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 27 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
