How can we explain ourselves to such people? Here is a simple explanation for someone who has not come across the topic before, as neutral as I can make it. People seem to get more steamed up about trans women than trans men, and while there are similarities there are also differences, so for once I will limit my remarks to trans women. There is evidence for a behaviour, men dressing in clothes culturally considered to be \u201cwomen\u2019s clothes\u201d, for at least 2500 years. There is evidence from many cultures around the world. There are cultural accretions to this phenomenon, but it is consistent. In the West, now, the phenomenon is generally understood under the concept of \u201ctrans woman\u201d. These are people who appear physically male, who wish to express ourselves as female. I have used a female name all the time since 2002, and with increasing frequency before then. Some say this is merely delusional. I am clearly not a woman. That depends on what \u201cman\u201d or \u201cwoman\u201d means. There is the creature, with primary and secondary sex characteristics, and then there is the cultural accretion of concepts of \u201cmanliness\u201d and \u201cfemininity\u201d. In Emile, Rousseau imagined an Ideal Woman, who would negate herself for the needs and desires of her man. Mary Wollstonecraft railed against this, understandably. To me, \u201cfeminine\u201d and \u201cmasculine\u201d are useful words, but men can be feminine and women masculine; and much of the oppression of women arises from the judging of women as \u201cunfeminine\u201d. I am exceptionally feminine, and have overcome my upbringing and culture sufficiently to express that, though not enough to cease resenting it and seeing it as weakness. I have no idea how I would express myself in a culture which valued femininity and masculinity equally in men and women. I have not experienced such a culture. Now, I am far more comfortable using a female name and expressing myself as a female. I have had vaginoplasty surgery, removing my gonads and creating a clitoris from my glans. There are many critics of such surgery, because removal of gonads is such a shocking taboo. Why would I want it? I do not suffer the common psychological causes of delusion- I have a diagnosis that I am \u201cnot psychotic\u201d- and the desire has appeared fixed and immovable. It does, generally, in us. Some theorise that we seek surgery because it is expected of us, that being a \u201ctrans woman\u201d, which involves desiring surgery, is socially acceptable but other forms of non-standard gender expression are not. I do not think social pressure is sufficient to overcome the taboo against self-mutilation. Certainly I am revolted by the thought of damage to any other part of my body; yet I hated those organs, and much prefer what I have now. All that is known is that we want surgery, and are happier after it. Should we have access to women\u2019s space, such as toilets, changing rooms, and services for abused and battered women? Most women seem to accept us, though there is a minority against. I am generally treated as an honorary woman. I am a refugee, rather than an asylum seeker.  \u00a0 ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 33 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
