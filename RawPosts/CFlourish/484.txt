I can walk across the field, along the river and round the Lakes, such a beautiful walk that I need no other. And- that town of 45,000 people is just over there, and there are 35,000 just that way, and the duel carriageway and the other duel carriageway. I am not a serious cyclist, and I can cycle away from those two \u201curban areas\u201d, and quickly be in proper countryside. The metalled road has no number, and I can hear no cars or machinery, only the birds. There are sheep and lambs in that field.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWoodbines- a great little cigarette\u201d says the metal sign. I thought tobacco advertising illegal, and Woodbines discontinued- the more disreputable George Orwell characters smoke Woodbines. On to \u2014\u2014\u2014-, which was a town before Mercia was a kingdom, and eat under the awning of the pub.  The rain is so light, that the tiny droplets could almost be mist- a \u201csmirl\u201d, I would call it. Across the fields, the trees more distant are mere impressions, and the Willow only hundreds of yards away is quite clear. So beautiful. These tiny villages are in the Domesday Book, with huge stone churches: all that love and respect and wealth going into building a place of worship. The church is open: I prop my bicycle outside, disdaining the lock. This is no longer the way I worship, but the stone and the Victorian pews make me feel instantly at home, in childhood, and my heart is warmed.\u00a0Standing in the bell tower at St Peter\u2019s, you see that the chancel bends off to the left: in the 12th century it was believed that if anything was perfect, the Devil would pay it particular attention to damage it, so the church was made imperfect. Parts of those two stained glass windows, one of St George, one of St Christopher, date from the 14th century, around the time of Bannockburn. I stopped the woman driving away from the Old Rectory to ask her to confirm that. I am amazed that stained glass could survive our cultural revolution under Edward VI. Going through G\u2014, I hear a familiar tune. At the infants\u2019 school, the six year olds are country dancing, to a tune I danced to when a child, and which Playford might have known. There is\u00a0a crowd of parents, one filming on her iPhone, some carrying trays of cakes. I stop to watch. Here are some words,\u00a0not quite\u00a0the words I remember: \u00a0The first couple separate, go out around the ring \u00a0You meet your partner going out, you meet her coming in \u00a0You honour your corner lady, promenade your own \u2013 sing \u00a0I want to be near you, you\u2019re the one, the one, the one \u00a0I want to be near you, you\u2019re the one for me ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 49 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
