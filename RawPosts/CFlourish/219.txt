It means \u201cabsurd- deserving derision or mockery\u201d. You can\u2019t say that! \u201cRidiculous\u201d- a \u201cman in a dress\u201d- no, perfectly normal, part of ordinary, beautiful human diversity. A trans woman. It\u2019s OK to be me. Am I being cissexist, considering myself as an Outsider from a cisnormative perspective? Possibly that\u2019s part of it. I am cissexist. I have grown up in a cissexist culture, and imbibed its notions. And it\u2019s not just that. My inner critic\u2019s concept of normality is a hard steel block with a lead core for extra weight, unmoving, unrelenting. It doesn\u2019t only object to me expressing myself female, it objects to much of my emotional reaction and spontaneous response. For me, \u201cfeel the fear and do it anyway\u201d includes \u201csee it\u2019s ridiculous and enjoy it anyway\u201d. There are other ways to respond to my inner voices. I can talk to them sensibly. I can explain this is OK, that I have a perfect right to do what I want to do, and that takes time and effort and does not really convince me because it is a feeling thing. Or I can answer \u201cWhat will people think?\u201d fears with I don\u2019t care. Some of them will disapprove, and some will disapprove strongly. I am safe enough. It is OK to be ridiculous. If dressing colourfully, doing things that please me and having fun are ridiculous, perforce I must be ridiculous. Or- it\u2019s a way of coping. I find coping difficult, so any way of coping has to be a good thing. Tell me of the ways of coping that work for you, and I may try them; but don\u2019t tell me not to cope in the way I know how.
