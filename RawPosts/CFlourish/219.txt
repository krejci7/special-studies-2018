I feel like I\u2019m not good enough to be a girl. I don\u2019t feel feminine enough. I get misgendered all the time.  I am not a woman. But I don\u2019t have to be. There is no pass mark. I have a Y chromosome, which is often thought of as disqualifying. If I have to be a woman, think, act, look like a woman, I will always worry I am failing. I have to be me. I can\u2019t fail at that unless I think I do. I still want to dress female, but why not if I want to? I can be terribly negative. I am not a woman, I think, and that leads on to OhmyGod I\u2019m a fake, fraud, failure- ridiculous, never should have done this\u2026 Whereas, it could be liberating. I am not a woman. So, no need to pass! Dividing people into \u201cmen\u201d and \u201cwomen\u201d makes no sense in modern society. It is the foundation of patriarchal oppression. Let it fade away. And then I read this article on \u201cColour-blindness\u201d. White people affect to be \u201ccolour-blind\u201d, not noticing colour, but is that really the case? Try it in a room full of black people. I have only been in a black-majority room once: the white people sat together. Black people cannot be colour-blind, he wrote: they always notice. \u201cColour-blind\u201d is part of privilege, part of being the default default. On that analogy, males, brought up to be assertive and still the cultural default- a female fbfnd shared something in sexist language only yesterday- have not earned the right to express ourselves as women. I am not good enough to be a girl. Let the one without sin cast the first stone. Most of us benefit from one or another kind of privilege or oppression. Yes, it matters, and this is the way I am. I dress in clothes from third world sweat shops, even if I wear clothes out and buy from charity shops. All of us are supported by others- sometimes the support is given under duress. I recognise that. I oppose it- well, you know, I share articles, sign petitions and talk earnestly to friends. We do what we can. ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 22 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
