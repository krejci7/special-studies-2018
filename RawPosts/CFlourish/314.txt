Stop Trans Chauvinism is a site reblogging Trans-Erasing rants. What is the pick of the TERFs over the last few days? They claim \u201cmisogyny, homophobia and racism in trans activism\u201d and publicise a vast number of reblogs from TERFs- six on 22 December alone. Normally they publish just the start of a post, but publish the whole of a study of outcomes of transition from 2011. \u201cGenderwipesthefingerprints\u201d gives a very short introduction saying, sex reassignment is positively correlated with a far higher risk of death and a greater number of suicide attempts. Tragic stuff. Correlated in part because of the hate spread by her site; and the study cannot say how we would fare without GRS. The study found 804 diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder, of whom 380 had GRS and changed the gender indicator on their National Registration Number (NRN), between 1973 and 2003. Death and morbidity were not significantly greater in the first ten years, but were, after. As the \u201cDiscussion\u201d in the study notes,  the overall mortality rate was only significantly increased for the group operated before 1989. However, the latter might also be explained by improved health care for transsexual persons during 1990s, along with altered societal attitudes towards persons with different gender expressions. Bad news for the TERFs, then: there is less hate; and for us: hate kills. After 2004, the NRN ceased to record gender. So, a bit of gloating and a misleading introduction from Stop Trans Chauvinism. The study also indicates the tiny number with gender dysphoria: why are the TERFs so obsessed with us? A better introduction to the study is here. Headline: Do trans activists realise they enable this kind of misogyny and self hatred? The \u201cself-hatred\u201d consists of referring to breasts as \u201cgross chest tumors\u201d and to the vagina as the \u201crape gash\u201d. But 4thwavenow is quoting a comment by a trans man. That\u2019s not misogyny and self-hatred, but gender dysphoria. We hate our physical sex characteristics. That\u2019s what the diagnosis means. The person quoted is forty, well able to make up his own mind. 4thwavenow is the mother of a teenager who formerly identified as FtM, but has decided against transition. She asks, Why wouldn\u2019t someone who actually cares about \u201ctrans\u201d people celebrate a teenager who won\u2019t have to endure years of injections and surgeries? It would be like a cancer patient becoming enraged when another patient goes into remission. No, it would be like a cancer patient enraged when another patient refuses treatment. I can\u2019t know whether 4thwavenow\u2019s child will transition later in life- whether the gender dysphoria was a passing teenage phase, or a matter of identity which the mother has rejected, to the child\u2019s lasting harm. But neither can she, \u201cStop Trans Chauvinism\u201d, or the laughing TERFs reading that bullshit. I always seek common ground with the most extreme haters, and here I find a link to Anti-porn feminists. I too am opposed to pornography, because of the risk of STD and physical damage to women whose penetration is depicted, as well as the objectification of women; but the post linked is a quote, a slab of text from The Colour of Pomegranates, a \u201cradical feminism/ marxism\u201d blog. In post-modernity, pornography is just another \u201ctext\u201d representing another narrative that no competing narrative can claim superiority over \u2026If reality, truth and meaning are socially constructed (van Zon, 2013) then it makes sense that the reality that pornography is detrimental can be obscured. So- what? Post-modernity and Post-modernism are therefore a bad thing? Opposition to pornography cannot continue? I use post-modern thought-processes. I oppose pornography. I am inconsistent- again, so what? And: feminine and masculine expression are socially constructed too. Post-modernism is an essential feminist tool. On anti-porn feminists, I found this comment: the automatic response from most people is to dismiss you as an anti-sex prude. Is it? I hear the feeling of being a beleaguered minority: is that how it really is, and does that contribute to the TERFs\u2019 vehemence and hatred against us? Most people accept me as an honorary woman. Maria Miller MP, chair of the Women and Equalities committee inquiry into trans people, said: \u201cWhat has been most shocking is to hear the personal experiences of trans people who have had almost had to accept the unacceptable: which is day-to-day abuse on the street by members of the public shouting at them, and almost having to accept that is part of their life,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is not acceptable.\u201d Take heart. Powerful voices support us. Changing, today, from El Greco to Raphael.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 32 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
