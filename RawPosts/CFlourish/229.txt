I had to investigate. In chapters 18 and 19 of Jane Eyre, he goes from his house on business, and returns in a red cloak and a black bonnet, or rather a broad brimmed gypsy hat, tied with a handkerchief under her chin. He/she proceeds to tell the fortunes of the unmarried women in his house, unsurprisingly telling such things! She knows all about us! Finally he speaks to Jane, who stands up to the gypsy, and in hinting his love for her he think[s] I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium, and reveals himself. She rebukes him: now, sir, what a strange idea!  Possibly he could not have played the trick dressed as a man, as he would have been recognised. A man would have to take off his hat, entering the house, a woman might keep on a bonnet. He is mean to his fianc\u00e9e, who wants to put the gypsy in the stocks. Jane thinks there is a trick, but imagines it is Mrs Poole the servant- the thought that a man might dress as a woman is beyond her. It\u2019s the sensible thing to do, if he wants to play this dishonourable trick, and yet the taboo of the clothes makes it worse.

No. 1 is that he locks his wife up, but the cross-dressing is no. 4. Why Jane doesn\u2019t throw up in her mouth a little when she discovers his little game is beyond me. The writer adds I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Rochester likes to wear Jane\u2019s underwear, too. Or, let\u2019s be honest: Bertha\u2019s. I found that from The Squeee, Why Mr Rochester is not a creep. Dressing in drag does not make you a creep, she says, trenchantly, and I am relieved. She is a huge Jane Eyre fan: her tag line is REVIEWS \u2666 RAMBLINGS \u2666 ROCHESTER \u2666 OCCASIONAL RICHARDING. Richarding is squeeeing about Richard Armitage. Should one incident matter? It depends whom you ask. This pdf makes the description a feminist statement: \u201cNo longer believable as an interior \u2018truth\u2019 of dispositions and identity, sex will be shown to be a performatively enacted signification (and hence not \u2018to be\u2019), one that, released from its naturalized interiority and surface, can occasion the parodic proliferation and subversive play of gendered meanings.\u201d A woman writer dressing a male character as a woman demolishes patriarchy.
