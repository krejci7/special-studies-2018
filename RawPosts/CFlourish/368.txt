I had heard the voice, grating and nasal but pleasantly variable in pitch. It seemed to be explaining stuff unnecessarily. -Can I sit here? -It\u2019s unoccupied. -What? -The seat is free. At this point, I only clocked that the person was a bit weird. She started to explain that she had been at a festival, that her phone battery had run out, and that she needed to charge it up all while leaning down round my legs to the electric socket. Hurriedly I suggested that we swap seats. However that meant standing up and entering the aisle. At this, a ribald shout went up from three seats behind. \u201cOho! You\u2019ve got a right one there, love. Good luck!\u201d I mentioned this to her. She plugged in her phone, and moved in a load of shopping bags, round my legs as well as hers. \u201cYou\u2019re trans, right? So am I.\u201d Yes. \u201cHave you had the operation?\u201d I said I thought that even with a trans woman this was too personal a question for such a short acquaintance. She told me that she had not had the operation, but that her name was Denise- she hates Dennis. She showed me her black denim jacket with \u201cDenise\u201d embroidered on the right breast, then her driving licence. \u201cThe driver number is what declares your sex,\u201d I said. \u201cYeah I know.\u201d She held it with her fingers obscuring all but the name and photo. I was uninterested in the name: I tried to see the driver number, but she put it away. She identifies as gender-queer. She is really a tom-boy, she explains: a butch woman. She has had her facial hair removed with laser and electrolysis: have you had electrolysis? I confirmed I had. She felt the need to expatiate more on being a tom-boy, but did not add anything. It is only ten minutes to my stop, but I know quite a lot about her. She knows I am trans, and my name. \u201cYou said people on the train were nasty to you, earlier?\u201d she asks, just as I am getting off. I think of trying to correct the misunderstanding, but decide against. The misunderstanding intrigues me. I told her that they were rude about her, and she has converted this to rude about me. \u201cEveryone is very accepting\u201d, she declared, definitely. I have rarely seen so clear an instance of someone not hearing what they do not want to hear, though I have one possible example of me filtering out unpleasant information and working it out later. And this need to explain, to a total stranger. She is not interested in me, particularly; she wants to tell me about herself. Perhaps she needs to reassure herself, or work it out for herself, and each such conversation helps her understand or accept herself better. After all, such explanation is what I am doing, here. Oh! We suffer, so much!  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 37 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
