It\u2019s not because I fear violence. Men in the genteel places I frequent are not violent. The decline in violent crime may have to do with the decline in heavy industry- men do not habitually undertake hard physical labour in dangerous places, so can be softer. I found women\u2019s loos pleasanter. This one has a carpet, and a box of tissues by the mirror to aid repairing ones make-up. Some have comfy chairs. There are dried or plastic flowers, and an air freshener to suppress ghastly smells. Men\u2019s loos are yuck. A trans man I met felt the opposite way. I really don\u2019t want to go in the gents. I get self-conscious thinking of it: \u201cEveryone would be looking at me and judging me!\u201d Other people think about you far less than you do, and if they do, it rarely matters; and I could overcome these feelings, as I have with taking off my wig in public. But the feelings are strong. It would be a symbol, that I am not a woman. A friend said trenchantly that she would go in the gents\u2019 if there was a long queue in the ladies\u2019. It\u2019s only a cubicle! I have done, once, in the aforementioned Employment Tribunal offices in Manchester, and the trans woman with me was shocked. This is me, reaching the nub, getting sidetracked and avoiding. I kind of feel alright, at the moment. I get to feel I have the right to exist if I play this game. It\u2019s not real, though. It would all just collapse, and I would have to find some other way. Or- I am accepted in society, sort of, like this, and part of the game is that I express myself female. It\u2019s a symbol that I am accepted in society. It is a symbol for other people, too: if I have to be excluded from the women\u2019s loos because I am a threat, I am more Othered, one of those it is acceptable to detest. I hope I could talk down the apprehension and distress in me. It is not that bad really. It is only a cubicle. I hope I could bear it. I pray I don\u2019t have to. How would it be for the straights, the normal folk? The social rules change. I have found a way I can bear to be me, in the world. It was difficult. I might have to find a new way. I don\u2019t want to. How do you feel about me in your loo, or the other loo?  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 26 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
