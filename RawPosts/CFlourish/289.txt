If people know about us, we are less threatening. Should we defend her? A comment here: Bruce was born male and raised male\u2014and he was a jock\u2026The males in my family were jocks\u2014and while their life experience was that of being treated like young princes\u2014my experience as a female was that of being treated like a servant. While they were at some sports field tossing a ball while people eagerly watched and cheered, I was doing their laundry\u2026 Bruce\u2019s life has been one of extreme MALE privilege. He has been fawned over and catered to as are all male jocks.  So fast forward, and Bruce announces at age 65 he\u2019s \u201calways felt [he] was a woman\u201d\u2026 his having this dream life of extreme male privilege not afforded to ANY woman, especially back when in was in his 20s and women were bared from holding certain jobs, like being a cop.  Not entirely a dream life- she lived with gender dysphoria. Bruce doesn\u2019t have a clue what it is to be a woman, because all his experiences have been as a fawned over male. Some women resent successful men, because patriarchy kept women from such success. I sympathise. But also, some women reject transgender when they don\u2019t feel the \u201cgender\u201d \u201cfeminine\u201d applies to them. Female sexuality, but not \u201cfemininity\u201d. Females\u2019 experiences, not a set of feelings peculiar to females. then- This is why some women take issue with male to female transgenders. She applies it to us. All of us. To me, she says, I totally support you doing whatever you need to in order to feel comfortable in your own skin yet she \u201cunderstands\u201d the women who \u201ctake issue\u201d. We are a class. As Stewart Lee says, mocking Islamophobes, \u201cI hate all Muslims- except the few I have met who are all all right\u201d. She says about Caitlyn what others say of all of us. Just to be clear, I have no objection to anyone wanting to change their name, their gender, their body, whatever. It\u2019s their business. I don\u2019t care if Bruce wants to present as a woman, that\u2019s his personal choice, BUT I do have a problem with him claiming he\u2019s been a woman all along. It\u2019s total B. fucking S. It doesn\u2019t matter what he \u201cfelt\u201d inside. The reality is, he wasn\u2019t ostracized or marginalized. \u2026 For him to now claim he\u2019s \u201calways been\u201d a woman\u2014after he has reaped the rewards as a male\u2014is an insult. Unfortunately, \u201cclaiming to be a woman\u201d is what we do. We pretend to be Manly to cover up how we feel inside, then we transition. Caitlyn made her money as an athlete, some of us barely muddle through. Caitlyn appears on a magazine cover, glammed up by the best make-up artists and photographers, and that is what celebrities do, not just her. Notice- she has to do that, to get what she wants. She has to behave as a woman of her class, now. Women have been kept from particular roles and shoe-horned into others. I have been unable to be myself for thirty years, and only when I transition can I find and value myself. \u201cI have been a woman all the time I presented male\u201d means this is not a whim, but liberation of my real self: feminine, but arguably not female. Caitlyn\u2019s struggle is my struggle. Her privilege is that of the rich. Attack the privilege of rich celebrities by all means, but if you pick on the trans woman as trans, you pick on me too. So we have to defend her. Our arguments fail completely if they fail in her case. And if others divide us into \u201csuffering trans\u201d who get sympathy and \u201cprivileged trans\u201d who do not, who can be attacked, all of us will be called \u201cprivileged\u201d eventually. I wrote that, then she commented again: Transgender women want to go into female dressing rooms and bathrooms. Some women don\u2019t feel comfortable with that. And that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s their right to not have someone they view as male enter their private area. All that sympathy for my victims, and I get erased. Mmm. What alternative do you propose? And how important is it, considering the number of trans women?  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 29 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
