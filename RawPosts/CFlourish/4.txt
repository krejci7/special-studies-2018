It is beautiful. I take a moment to delight in it in the bathroom as I clean my teeth: the shape of my leg, the strength of it, the balance and poise. I love my strong, sharp teeth. I am evolved, here, over half a billion years as a multicellular eukaryote, fifty million years as a primate, and I fit, as a beautiful animal. Presenting male part of my sense of inadequacy as a man linked to my body, how thin it was. It shamed me because I compared it to some imagined different form. The ideal body is a curse, a way of blinding people to their beauty. Then I transitioned, and could be myself in a way I could never be, before, including my body. After seeing it through a smoggy veil of misery, I saw it clearly for the first time. My hands had delighted me before, able to create complex music on a piano, and now I loved the sensation of walking or cycling, the movement of muscles and the feel of ground under foot. Simone Weil: There is something sacred in every human being, but it is not their person. It is this human being; no more and no less. There is not some ideal \u201cI\u201d, an intellectual construct which owns \u201cmy\u201d body. There is a human animal, one thing, whole, its systems working together, neurons spreading throughout the physical creature providing perceptions processed by the whole being. I have been reading of the \u201cmind/body problem\u201d and the \u201cComputational theory of mind\u201d which seem to me to perpetuate this hellish delusion or intellectual error, that we are thoughts, processed more or less rationally, and interactions at an intellectual level, symbolised by the dark grey suits and white shirts of men, hiding their shape. I can \u201ccompute\u201d a multiplication of immaterial numbers, but anything else I do- relate to other humans, create poetry and prose, play and sing for my own immediate spontaneous delight- is far more than computation. I am all that is within my skin. For the disembodied mind, sex is not an encounter of two perfect animals but a ritual response to need, following a pattern determined by others communicated through pornography. The disembodied man, a dark grey suit, sees women as \u201cbits and pieces of flesh\u201d. Or, the computational mind surrenders control like a werewolf, becoming not even an animal but a set of responses, which can no more value the other than it values itself. For the sacred human, togetherness is the mystery of another, two presences knowing each other unconsciously, so impenetrably to that computer. Woman is the mystery of the mother, the origin of the world, which grows a child within a body and gives it birth in pain and joy. My womanhood is my Self, in every interdependent cell of my body, in all of me physical and responsive which my womanhood liberated. I process perception in a way my consciousness imagined as a computer, or a \u201crational man\u201d, could not know. It leads me to act in Love, as the fulfilment of my animal, primate, human nature. As I write, now, I stretch my body, luxuriating in it.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
