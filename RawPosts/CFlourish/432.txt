Otherwise, at 88, he would have needed a carer. He might not have lasted this long. Christmas 2001, they had been married for two months. I visited: it was the three of us, her descendants were in their own homes. On the Sunday I went to the Quaker meeting then to visit Sheena in Linlithgow, dressed female. I was still presenting male at work, but less and less, elsewhere. I got back to Dad\u2019s flat, and went into the spare bedroom. Dad told me I would have to get changed in order to spend the evening with Margaret, who would be home from her visiting soon. Later, he came in to tell me I had to get changed as Margaret was arriving. I stayed, lying on the bed. Just as I had started cleaning off my make-up he came in to tell me I could stay dressed. And I wonder whether he projected his distress at my transition onto her- even whether I was part of that projection. After I went full time, in April 2002, he told me I could not be in the house when she was there. I did not see her again until 2004. He complained about her so much that when she wanted to move back to B\u2014- I thought he might not go too. He complained about her to my sister as well. Now, my sister\u2019s children call Margaret \u201cGrandma\u201d (my mother had the baby-name of \u201cLi\u201d) and may be more likely to stay in touch with her than with me. And yet it was unquestionably good for him. I don\u2019t know what his social life would have been like, but with her this year he could live independently, and without her he would need some carer- me, possibly- at least to shop and to do some of the housework and any gardening. He was dressing and bathing himself, I think. If he, or we, were projecting distress at my transition onto her, had he not remarried that distress would have to come out in some other way, and we might have had a more honest relationship. When I had aversion therapy in 1991, he (I have just found the title for this post.) accepted me. I did not have to have aversion therapy, he said: if that was the way I needed to relax it was fine by him. Now I say I am glad he remarried, because it was so good for him. Even though it drove us apart, or at least after it our relationship was more distant. That is the generous thing to say.  0.000000 0.000000 ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 44 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
