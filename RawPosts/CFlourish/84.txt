She had enjoyed it. How wonderful to make an impression on someone like that! I really enjoyed meeting Kirsty. She was walking up the path as I was leaving my tent for the Eucharist. We talked deeply, enjoyed the sun together, and without irony she expressed admiration for my wisdom. I can\u2019t remember anything we talked about. I saw her again just as I was leaving, and we hugged warmly. She is a lovely person, and found me a lovely person. With another, I enjoyed getting my reference understood- I had \u201cseen a cloud no bigger than a man\u2019s hand\u201d. At Greenbelt, we consecrate the bread and wine together. We are worshipping, we become one body, but we need no priest or leader to do that, just the whole group of several thousand people. I raised my hand in blessing of the bread and wine- the priest\u2019s physical action is much like a healer channelling Qi- and we share it among ourselves. We danced and we sang and we heard a teenager preach through a speech device she programs through eye movements, as she was starved of oxygen at birth. She quoted Daniel 7:9- an Ancient One took his throne;  his clothing was white as snow,  and the hair of his head like pure wool;  his throne was fiery flames,  and its wheels were burning fire. God- in a wheelchair!! She was delighted to find God in her image in the Bible. God is us, and we are God: God is trans as well, the Father gathering us under Motherly wings. We are acceptable before God. As I was packing up my tent, a man was walking by on the path, so I asked him to help me roll it up. \u201cAre we folding it in half?\u201d he asked. No, we are folding it from one end, about 2\u20196\u2033 wide folds, then rolling up the folded tent. It is so much more efficient when you have one person each side, folding it inwards, dashing back and forth to do that is a pain. I roll the tent round the inner tent and the poles, but officiously he started to roll it up by itself, ponderously, forcing out the air. He was taking charge, diminishing me by looking after me. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to dry it out later, or it will be smelly,\u201d he warned. Well, that\u2019s my decision. The rain had dried off in sunshine, the underside was not damp, I thought, it will be hard to roll up again if there is a breath of wind. He was talking down to me. In the marquee, where the actors were preparing for their show, I looked over the shoulder of one into the mirror. Yuk. I have an old wig on, it is squashed flat, and its look displeases me. I push vaguely at the front, then move away. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to spend some time on that,\u201d says a woman. She judges I have no idea how to present my hair, and starts to educate me. I could push it behind my ears, she tells me. That means I notice my own grey hair, and it looks more like a hat plonked on my head rather than my hair, I feel. What I said was, I was self-conscious about the tabs above my ears. \u201cOh, nobody notices those,\u201d she said. My concerns don\u2019t matter. She will show me what to do. She showed me in her own hair how it was fine around the temples, and how she had had to draw it forward to conceal that. I back-comb the front of my wig with my fingers, and it plumps out a bit. \u201cThat does not look too bad,\u201d she says. It\u2019s good enough. I want to take it off, possibly will drop it on the floor, and did not want to take my human hair wig. I don\u2019t need to look impeccably groomed. I still got recognised, and given the microphone to speak from the floor.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 9 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
