Let cheerfulness become a climate that surrounds you, day in, day out \u2026 a constant undercurrent. On the surface you may be doing anything, but deep down there should be a singing heart. Unless you can remain cheerful, life is bound to become heavier everyday \u2026 the only thing that can keep you flowing is cheerfulness. So don\u2019t miss an opportunity; whenever you can, laugh, smile, dance, sing \u2026 Then a miracle happens one day: you become so full of light that you can go into darkness and the darkness disappears. You become so cheerful that you can go into sadness and the sadness starts laughing. \u2013 Osho On Sunday 21st I was in a state of misery and terror. I felt not grounded: not knowing anything, not able to know anything, my not knowing a threat to my well-being so that I could not care for myself. I thought, these feelings will pass, and answered myself- only because I blot them out! They are the rational response to the situation! What brought it on? I knew my friend was just not that interested in me. We would have gone for a drink but she had no time. Then I phoned G for a chat and found they had been together. Possibly something around not-knowing: there are these feminist arguments for or against innate differences between the sexes, and I would like to argue for differences- but feel unable. I would face too much hostility. I argued against. It seemed clear to me. Then I read evidence for- and am just confused. So much on the web is people so certain, and I can\u2019t be. Cis people are arguing about me, and trans folk butting in face such hostility! I should ignore it, but it is on places I go. So the ungroundedness. I was read as lower class. I was in the coffee shop, dressed for cycling, and picked up The Guardian. \u201cWould you like this?\u201d said a man, offering me The Express. No, I like papers with a higher reading-comprehension level. \u201cNo thanks, I\u2019m left wing,\u201d I said. I phoned the Samaritans, and he said \u201cYou\u2019re clearly highly educated and intelligent\u201d early in the call, just after -Is there a name I can call you? -Clare and I felt his surprise, and conscious readjustment Or, it\u2019s small child again. The monster will get me. Imminent death. I wasn\u2019t in the terror when I phoned. The worst had passed, and I felt tired and fragile. Seeing it like weather helps some people- don\u2019t go out when it\u2019s raining too hard. It isn\u2019t always raining. I felt I would always have to battle through the rain. I am so lonely. Contact on the net is no substitute. I want to feel useful- but then, in work I did not always either, I was following procedures rather than doing anything worthwhile. Walking in the park, I feel moments of delight in beauty- but am unsure I like the experience of the whole walk. Or, sometimes, biting into a peach- I am aware of the mindfulness theory, that such moments are available continuously. I want them to be. Is it my judgment, accepting or resisting in the moment, rather than the thing itself?  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 30 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
