trans real self verse 
 Birds gotta swim, and fish gotta fly I’ve gotta be the same girl till I die Can’t stop bein’ that gal o’ mine Tho’ I weep, and storm, and rage, and cry Try to deny- Oh how I try I Can’t stop being that girl of mine It cannot be true, it must be a lie Awake all night, I ask myself why I Can’t stop being that girl of mine Then become calm, give up with a sigh Under the fake, it is the real I that can’t help bein that gal o mine Written while considering transition
