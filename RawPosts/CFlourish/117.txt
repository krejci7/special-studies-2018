Yet the idea of autogynephilia is still used to attack trans women, sometimes by other trans women. Go to Urban Dictionary and vote down the third definition, which imagines two kinds of trans women: homosexual transsexuals, and autogynephiliacs. \u201cAshley has randomly transitioned from male to female despite being age 55. I think she\u2019s autogynephilic.\u201d \u201cRose just spent her children\u2019s university savings on sexual reassignment. She\u2019s in the throes of autogynephilia.\u201d \u201cI just danced all over Ally last night, and didn\u2019t even know she used to be male. Her movements and voice are so femme. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s autogynephilic.\u201d It creates a complete dichotomy. No homosexual transsexual transitions over age 25. All gynephile trans women are autogynephiliac. Most laughs in the Urban Dictionary are snark, but even by their standards this is a strong attack. I wonder if the statistic that 90% of trans women are gynephile has any basis in reality. Most cis people are straight, so that could just mean that the proportions of gynephile and androphile trans women are the same as in cis men. It seems to me that more people transition without GRS, and this is out of a desire not to be mutilated. Why should you have your genitals altered? What good does it do? People talk of wanting the \u201cpoison glands\u201d taken away, and orchiectomy means you don\u2019t need testosterone suppressants- it is less invasive in the long run- but possibly we are altered because of social pressure. We desire a woman\u2019s role, and everyone said that required body modification. Or, possibly we gynephiles are sexually passive, and that means we feel greater dislike for male organs. Anyway, gender dysphoria was popularly understood to mean body alteration, and now many trans folk don\u2019t seek that. I did not have facial feminisation surgery, but have known gynephile trans women who did. It involves grinding away the bones of the skull. I find the idea horrible, but again it could be that there is not the same social pressure. You will pass better after FFS, and that makes life easier, however much we assert that people should be treated differently according to other criteria, and not whether they pass or whether they are beautiful. Passing privilege and attractiveness privilege exist. A trans woman with a clear eye to her own interest might have FFS rather than GRS. The writer hedges his/her bets with the words \u201ccommon\u201d and \u201cgenerally\u201d. All generalisations are wrong; but either the dichotomy is real, or it isn\u2019t. There is no rational basis to this hostility- if it comes from anywhere, it is the idea that we make them look bad, that people would accept androphile trans women if the gynephiles weren\u2019t messing it all up by being so revolting. But no-one who is intolerant of trans women would think the difference mattered at all. What of this assertion? Generally, the two types of trans women don\u2019t associate with each other in any way. If you are an androphile trans woman, please leave a comment. I find that trans women do not associate with each other generally, whatever their orientation, particularly after transition.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 12 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
