I think it important to mourn our dead, including our countless suicides, but I also think it important to celebrate our heroes, people who have transcended the difficulties of being transsexual and given something to the World. Just a few, in no particular order: Lynn Conway Ad\u00e8le Anderson Dana International Anna Grodzka Marci Bowers I was delighted a few years ago when Fascinating Aida appeared on Woman\u2019s Hour on Radio 4 without the transsexuality being mentioned. Other things were more interesting. It is\u00a0a sign of acceptance. Also I remember the courage and strength of our pioneers, such as April Ashley, who is still going strong. I could name my own personal heroes, but some are in stealth, and I do not want to out people. In one way, it is no more sensible of me to be \u201cproud\u201d of the achievements of these women than of the achievements of, say, left handed people. But I am inspired to see what may be achieved, and how any difficulties arising from transsexuality may be transcended. And I have fellow-feeling with them, as I have with Scots, and pleasure in the value and worth of my kind. ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 53 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
