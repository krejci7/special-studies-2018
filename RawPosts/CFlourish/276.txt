They are close, but not touching. One has her right elbow on the back of the couch, pointing towards the other, her hand supporting her head. Her left leg is crossed over her right knee, the foot extending forward. Her body is an arc. At the centre of the arc sits the other, sitting forward on the couch, ankles crossed demurely and pulled back on the floor beneath her, hands folded in her lap. Enveloped- symbolically, at least, though she is taller and heavier. Quite sexy, actually. Nothing makes sense. You can rationalise, of course. I had a pointless debate this morning about \u201cassisted dying\u201d- the new neutral/in favour word for euthanasia. Having been suicidal, I will cling to life until I can no longer keep conscious, no longer draw a breath. I know this. S counters with a man with kidney cancer metastasised into the bones, in agony, in a hospice. He is given a particular arranged time with all his faculties to express love and say goodbye, and then he is given enough analgesic to take his pain away, even though it nearly sedates him. He is \u201cout of it\u201d until he \u201cpasses away\u201d. Thank God I don\u2019t have to choose for real, for a friend, or for the Law of the Land. You are allowed to think people should have the choice to die! The Oregon rules sound rational and compassionate. Please let me remain revolted. Transition certainly does not make sense. You can make the case about brain differences or \u201cwoman trapped in a man\u2019s body\u201d- or against about autogynephilia being perverted- and for anyone for whom \u201cI wanted to so I did\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting and they shouldn\u2019t\u201d is not enough, there is reams of rationalisation, arguments from the authority of thousands of trans women\u2019s responses and peer-reviewed journal papers, but no argument will change any mind affected with desire or revulsion. Thank God most people don\u2019t care much, and \u201cthey seem harmless enough\u201d is good enough for them. \u201cShe wanted this, so why not?\u201d \u201cTakes all sorts to make a world.\u201d I cared- so- Much! How can anyone not? Yet they don\u2019t. Being attracted to people who are controlling and manipulative, I can hardly complain when someone is controlling and manipulative. Given that nothing that I want makes sense, why should this? If someone plays my heart-strings, and makes me feel soft, I enjoy and resent it, for Love has almost always been a source of shame and misery for me. Stop thinking! Stop knowing there is nothing promised, and just enjoy the moment, that word, the single \u201cx\u201d in that text. I was a lawyer for a time. It is a game, or a battle- judges might need to consider justice, representatives can\u2019t (except as a rationalisation for fighting harder) and if having a lawyer means the opposition caves in, knowing winning a case is more hassle than giving in to you, Hooray! Let it happen Just enjoy it If only I could!  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 28 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
