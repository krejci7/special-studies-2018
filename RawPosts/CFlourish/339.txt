 I have suppressed, judged myself and pretended so long, that it is hard to stop. Of course we all suppress. I had thought I would enter officer training, then learned I would not for at least a year, and at the Territorial Army compound that evening told the lieutenant. When she sympathised, I nearly cried, but managed to stop myself. She acknowledged this with “good man”. Surely, some men might almost have cried?

In the morning, I thought, “There’s the woman whose name I don’t know.” I remembered her surname, but we are all on first name terms.
