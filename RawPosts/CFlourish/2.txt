There are no clear answers. The Office for National Statistics has no established estimates. The census of 2011 had a question asking sex, giving the options male or female. I am non-binary. There was no question on that. Since 2005, only a few thousand people have received gender recognition certificates, but they are expensive, and require a specialist psychiatrist\u2019s letter. Many might not bother, but would get a GRC after self-certification. About two hundred trans people a year have genital operations on the NHS, about the number of new GRCs. Many more people might call themselves transgender. The ONS puts it at 0.5-1%, or about half a million people. The Equality and Human Rights Commission put it at 1%. Ten years ago the government commissioned the Gender Identity Research and Education Society, GIRES, to estimate the number of trans people. They considered passports, which can be changed as soon as you transition. They estimated 300,000-500,000 people experiencing some degree of gender variance. Many would not act on that, or might dress at home. It\u2019s about feelings, not actions. If you are unhappy with your assigned gender, and have to hide that, it affects you adversely. In the next census, there should be a question on sex assigned at birth then a question on gender identity. If it asked \u201cdo you identify as a transgender person\u201d not all the 500,000 people might say yes, and some might mock the question: the 2011 census question on religion identified 176,632 \u201cJedi knights\u201d, down from 390,000 in 2001. Some are in denial, and some would not like to admit it. Many of that half million will never take any action to change their gender presentation. Not all trans children come out to their parents, who would answer the census question on their behalf. The 2021 census will have to be designed soon. The Yougov poll asked people to define their gender on a scale from 0, completely masculine, to 6, completely feminine. 2% of males aged 18-24 said they were \u201ccompletely feminine\u201d, 8% said they did not know, and 3% said they were neither masculine nor feminine. No females aged 18-24 said they were completely masculine, but 7% did not know and 10% said neither. More men had a negative than positive view of masculinity, but women were more positive. Both sexes were strongly positive about femininity. Only 28% of British men, but 42% of American men, said they were completely masculine. I wonder how many women \u201cwear the trousers\u201d in their heterosexual relationship, but can\u2019t find anyone even asking the question. Most data from More or Less on Radio 4.
