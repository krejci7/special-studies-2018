I presented male, and now express myself female. So I am \u201cTransgender\u201d, as this is to do with my way of presenting myself to the World, and expressing myself to myself. But- the word \u201ctransgender\u201d implies that sex does not come into it. In previous usage, there was a distinction between \u201ctranssexuals\u201d who had the operation, and \u201ctransgenderists\u201d who did not. I had male sex organs. Arguably my sex was male. Yet I revolt against that idea: it is so deep, so ingrained, so natural that I am female that I think of my sex as female, too, throughout my life. Something in my brain, something in my genes, something. So I do not like the word \u201ctranssexual\u201d- crossing between the sexes- because I feel I have always been female. One advantage of \u201cTranssexual\u201d as an identity is (Irony ALERT!!) that if the bigot looks at me, I can whine, \u201cI\u2019m not like those weirdos over there. I\u2019m transsexual! I\u2019ve had the operation and everything! Transvestites are perverts, but I have a medical condition!\u201d However, justifying myself to a bigot is a mug\u2019s game. It is impossible. And- I do not want to be accepted because I have gone down a certain path. I want to be accepted because I am human, and I want that extended to everyone. So, we use the word \u201cTrans\u201d. It is inclusive. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 On culture: the kilt, though skirt-like, is a man\u2019s garment, and trousers are a woman\u2019s garment. But the cultural issue is deeper than that: the kilt, with deep pleats in a heavy fabric, swings in a masculine way. It is not feminine. So, culturally, I can go so far. I can accept that men wear something which partially resembles a skirt, but I want it to be masculine. Men in something feminine is transgressive. Women\u2019s trousers are cut differently, in different colours and fabrics. The Restoration gentleman, in bright-coloured velvet and lace with a long curly wig still wore trousers, while the ladies wore long skirts. I can accept the different cultural expression of masculinity as long as there is a distinction. Oh, right. That is conservative. Not radical at all. I need the distinction. I am uncomfortable without it. Then I can accept others if it is explained to me. The concept of Neutrois, for example, someone identifies as neither man nor woman. Oh, OK. This person is neutrois. I can probably restrain myself from policing the person\u2019s apparent gender expression, but I will certainly notice it. This person is Genderqueer. I learn, slowly. Remember this is a trans woman writing- I have a reaction, then a moment\u2019s thought while I apply my Diversity understanding, and I may need to consciously apply that Diversity understanding repeatedly. And- not just as a matter of gender- I am not good with people new to me. I need to spend time with people before I am comfortable with them. Part of my noticing, part of my staring, is considering- is this a possibility for me? If people stare at women hand in hand, it might be bigoted condemnation, or fearful admiration- But that\u2019s not allowed \u2013is it? ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 45 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
