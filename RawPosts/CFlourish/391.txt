In the war within myself, religion has been on both sides. I love this:  It\u2019s like we Christians love the idea of grace,\u00a0but we don\u2019t\u00a0want it\u00a0distributed\u00a0indiscriminately- we want make rules about it and dole it out carefully and strategically. It\u2019s like we\u2019re worried that if\u00a0everybody\u00a0knows that she\u2019s loved and accepted by God \u2013 it will be Grace\u00a0Anarchy! I want that. I want Grace Anarchy. I want people to be free to be who they are. It makes sense to me\u00a0that the free-er people are, the BETTER people are. I believe in people because I believe in God. I think God knew what God was doing when God made each of us. Peter, who is over ninety, does not understand me. He asked me once whether F, who is lesbian and butch, was a man or a woman. I confuse him by arriving at the Quaker meeting in a cycle helmet then appearing later in my wig. Once, when I was overheated and he saw me without my helmet he thought I was a man. I was irritated. I thought, I do not want to explain to Peter. I could ask someone else to explain to him. So he came up to me, again, this morning, and said \u201cI thought you were two people\u201d. I told him I wear a wig, and took it off to show him. I did not start on being trans. Maybe later. Ernest, who is over ninety and nearly blind, mistakes my voice for a man\u2019s. It was much easier than I had feared. Just because he does not understand, does not mean he condemns. It has seemed to me he lives among so much that he does not understand, and I took that as an important lesson to keep as flexible in thought as I can, hearing the world view of the next generations: because I will still be around when the world is theirs. My trust levels are low. I need to practise trust. It is alright. As I accept and trust others, I am freed. I could almost be glad that Peter asks: he is my example. My friend confessed a compulsive obsession to me. I am so glad to hear it: it shows she trusts me. I am glad to be trustworthy. Just for bloggers: I always use the useful editor, rather than the beep-boop, because the beep-boop does not always record posts, and is generally horrible. With The Penguin\u2019s script, you can too. All links will go to the useable editor, rather than the beep-boop. WordPress is generally user-friendly, so its pointless, arrogant attack on its users irked me.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 40 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
