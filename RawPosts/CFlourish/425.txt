I have been away for the weekend, staying in someone\u2019s house, and this is how I repay her? However, as I have spent that time listening to her tedious, self-satisfied, ridiculous and/or commonplace ramblings, I feel she is the one beholden, to me. C. and I have some similarities. We both were brought up Anglican and Tory and have become Quaker and Liberal, and we both have transitioned. I find her rather a bore, when she phones up for an hour at a time, but she was slightly less dull in the flesh, so when she invited me to Yorkshire I thought I might as well go. I have little better to do. She has a great regard for her sense of humour, which consists of deliberate misinterpretation and malapropism: this morning when she mispronounced \u201cpossibility\u201d as \u201cpissibolity\u201d for the umpteenth time, I said that it was probably her cleverest witticism. This drew a hurt denial. She remarked that she had meant to fill the bird-bath. -How do you fill it? (An inane enough question, but sincerely meant at the time.) -With water, she replied, triumphantly. She looked after me well enough, with a comfortable bed, reasonable food and a gift of a jar of home-made marmalade. Each meal she produced, she told me how she likes simple food, well prepared. She insisted I wore my wig at all times outside the bedroom: when our mutual friend O. visited, C saw her with her wig off, with just a few wisps of hair round the side of the head. It ruined the \u201cillusion\u201d. Worse, she told me at least once a day how her own hair had grown thicker, and returned to formerly bald areas, after she started using Evorel oestrogen patches. Yes, I am really happy for you. No, my own hair-loss is too far gone for me to hope ever not to need a wig if I want to look remotely female, I said the first couple of times, then yes no or um when she paused, as if encouraging her to proceed; and finally I was silent when she started on that one. She paused for my prompt, and when I did not make \u201cgo on\u201d noises looked puzzled for a moment then ploughed on regardless. Yesterday we went to York, where she took meretricious photos of the Minster. Finding a couple with a guide-book at one of the \u201cbars\u201d, or openings in the wall (I would say \u201cgate\u201d but a \u201cgate\u201d is a road) she screeched \u201cAre you lost?\u201d and prosed at them: I felt embarrassment I have not felt since I was a teenager with my parents. We walked round the wall, a dull enough entertainment, it is a raised stone path between warehouse shops on one side, and 1950s tenements on the other. I went ahead while she took photographs, then sat on a bench by the river to let her catch up, blissfully relieved of the burden of her presence. Then she arrived, and treated me to a precise inventory of the ailments which prevent her from walking faster. I say I am a man, or whatever- I don\u2019t really know, it doesn\u2019t really matter- but she insists she is a Woman with a Gender Dysphoric History. Her \u201ctrans\u201d nature is in the Past. She went on at great length on this. \u201cDo you see yourself as ever working again?\u201d she asked. \u201cI have absolutely no idea,\u201d I replied. Fortunately for her, this headed her off from either condoling or preaching further. I should give her a shop window dummy to talk at. She did not want me to tell her anything more than it would, and perhaps she would then not need to inflict her hospitality on anyone else.
