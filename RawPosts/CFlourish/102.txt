More the lilt than anything. His is a mesolect, distinctively Glasgow but clear enough for any Brit, probably any native English speaker, to understand what he is saying. No, I\u2019m not mimicking you, this is jist- how Ah speak, sometimes. Here\u2019s a man, unselfconsciously, unaffectedly masculine. A solid bloke. It is rather wonderful. -How\u2019ve you been? -Fighting vaguely the old ennui, I said. And we were away, on mid-20th century musicals. He was in a group singing songs from them. He went to Kiss me Kate and quotes from \u201cI hate men\u201d- \u201cHe may have hair upon his chest, but so has Lassie!\u201d \u201cFish really don\u2019t need bicycles,\u201d I said. I am more and more uncomfortable, here, mirroring, empathising, mimicking, whatever it is I am doing. I fled in resentment thinking, Don\u2019t make a man out of me- we are blokes, talking in a blokey way, and I don\u2019t want to. I am uncomfortable enough with my gender at the moment. I feel I am now a bloke, talking like a bloke, except in a wig and bra and a silk skirt and sandals with delicate straps which make my feet look pretty. At the time I thought it was how he was responding to me, treating me like a bloke, and now I wonder if it was me, mirroring or whatever. I want to be a me I feel comfortable with, so go and talk to a woman in a different style and register. We are again sharing about things that please us but now enjoying the other\u2019s pleasure rather than subtly competing, around human contact rather than Cole Porter\u2019s rhymes and word-plays, and this is far more comfortable for me. \u201cMay I have a hug?\u201d I ask. Of course you may. I cycle through the town. A man gets up from a table in the street, staring at me, advancing in a sort of Sumo pose, and grunting- not like an ape, as the ape would have more dignity. Had a million years of evolution passed him by? It felt shocking and threatening, and I wondered what was going on for him then. I was cycling late at night last week when a pedestrian decided to sprint after me. I pedalled faster to get away, again threatened. It has happened before. It is a drunk, boisterous man having a bit of a laugh, and if he caught me he would not know what to do with me, probably- it is a play threat rather than serious intended violence, I hope- and I am discomposed. We looked at the blokes at the bar, and she said how unattractive they all were, how badly turned out in that uniform of jeans and tshirts, how stupid their masculine poses which don\u2019t fit them, and this morning I was thinking how I am not a woman, how \u201ctrans woman\u201d is only an approximation to Be Who I Am, how I do not fit, even how I might revert, though having grown breasts makes that difficult.\u00a0From wrong to wrong the exasperated spirit moves. In Meeting I decided I could not tell what was Real Me and what Ego-self, what Child or Carer, what the \u201cImage of God\u201d as Richard Rohr calls it and what the \u201csmall self\u201d. I kept looking at the clock, and felt uncomfortable, beside this large, friendly man- Oh! How\u00a0Wicked to be writing of people at the Quaker meeting! I am not, though, only about my reaction to them- and my comforting thought at the very end was, yes, I have to let that go, but only that particular plan for getting what I starve for, I don\u2019t have to deny I am starving or let go of the hope that I might somehow, sometime, be satisfied. Now, this mirroring or mimicking or whatever it is- my strong presumption is that my characteristics are blessings, not curses, to be welcomed, cherished, appreciated, and used ever more skillfully and choice-fully. I can mirror, and I can- be myself??? I don\u2019t know who I am.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 11 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
