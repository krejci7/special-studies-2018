US Catholic bishops have signed a letter seeing us not as individuals but as some nebulous threat: The movement today to enforce the false idea\u2014that a man can be or become a woman or vice versa\u2014is deeply troubling. It compels people to either go against reason\u2014that is, to agree with something that is not true\u2014or face ridicule, marginalization, and other forms of retaliation. Most of us just want to be left alone. We shun recognition because of hatred like this letter preaches. The letter casts the transphobes as victims, of unnamed \u201cretaliation\u201d, which justifies them in dehumanising and oppressing us. I never asked anyone to \u201cagree with something that is not true\u201d. Instead, I ask them to recognise my humanity, and my right to pursue my desires, as long as I harm no-one else. That means treating me with courtesy. Some may think me a man, but I ask them not to make that obvious every time we meet: so they should use my name and correct pronouns. Why should these old men appoint themselves judges of what is \u201ctrue\u201d? Rigid consistent notions of truth leave no room for diversity or complexity, for the love and life which bishops should nurture. Society is in flux. Rather than clinging to their old ideas of Truth they should be open to how the Holy Spirit moves in humanity. For they are deeply conservative, and any radical feminist should avoid saying anything which might encourage them. We come together to join our voices- pompous, portentous rubbish showing fear and anger-  on a more fundamental precept of our shared existence, namely, that human beings are male or female and that the socio-cultural reality of gender cannot be separated from one\u2019s sex as male or female. Gender cannot be separated from sex. God has ordained, according to these old fools, that women must be feminine, men masculine, according to their definitions not any sane psychology of humanity. They use positive words, then weasel words which eat away all the love. They only fool themselves that they are loving. A person\u2019s discomfort with his or her sex, or the desire to be identified as the other sex, is a complicated reality that needs to be addressed with sensitivity and truth. Each person deserves to be heard and treated with respect; it is our responsibility to respond to their concerns with compassion, mercy and honesty. \u201cTruth\u201d; \u201cHonesty\u201d- no, their ridiculous insistance that children conform to their ideas of gender. So there can be no sensitivity, no comprehension of complicated reality, no respect, compassion or mercy. Their wicked ideas of gender must be enforced rigorously on children, they say. Children especially are harmed when they are told that they can \u201cchange\u201d their sex or, further, given hormones. Whip the sissy out of that boy! It\u2019s the only \u201cloving\u201d way! Note the scaremongering of \u201cgiven hormones\u201d- children getting puberty blockers is incredibly rare. There is a stupid and arrogant insistence that they know more about medicine than doctors: we urge our medical institutions to honor the basic medical principle of \u201cfirst, do no harm\u201d- as if the whole letter was not urging harm. We desire the health and happiness of all men, women, and children. A lie, immediately contradicted. Therefore, we call for policies that uphold the truth of a person\u2019s sexual identity as male or female, and the privacy and safety of all. No, not privacy and safety, but the enforcement of their idea of truth. I hate their self-deluded claims to virtue. Desire health and happiness, forsooth, or \u201cauthentic support\u201d of trans people to reject our God-given nature. It is a wonderful example of delusion, these ridiculous Catholics, joining with the tiny \u201cAnglican Church of North America\u201d, a splinter group claiming 134,000 members in the US and Canada but with an eejit styling himself \u201cArchbishop and Primate\u201d. Oh, here\u2019s some fool calling himself \u201cMelchizedek\u201d, after the Eternal priest. He is Orthodox, and claims 90,000 members in the US. The \u201cNorth American Lutheran Church\u201d is another recent splinter group, claiming 141,000 members who cannot stay in communion with Lutherans in the US. There is a token Muslim who styles himself \u201cimam\u201d and has founded his own Islamic Society of the Washington Area. They are all pathetic and ridiculous, yet their malice is all the stronger for their claims to \u201cLove\u201d, and they have some influence on poor fools, who they would order to torture children in the name of \u201cTruth\u201d. Lest we forget, they hate gay people too. They  affirm our commitment to marriage as the union of one man and one woman and as the foundation of society. I fear for their victims; yet they are nervous and afraid. They would not bother with such bombastic drivel if they did not know that doctors and parents are accepting children as they really are, and trans people are treated with growing acceptance and respect. Oh, google the original if you must.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 3 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
