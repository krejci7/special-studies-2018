Surely he will stay on the pavement? I look, worriedly, at the back of his head and hope he will look round. I cannot evade him because of the oncoming car. I can\u2019t stop, so I scream; he looks round and brakes. I pedal on, and from far behind me I hear his aggrieved exclamation: The fxxk! Scream like that? And now, I am so envious of him: that reflexive self-righteousness, he resents me and my wronging him. He is the good person here. Whereas I am analysing the situation and after much thought, have decided that my conduct passes muster, though I wonder if I should have reacted sooner. There are advantages to the worried assessment- \u201cAm I good enough? Did I wrong him?\u201d which seems a more feminine response. The cars I notice waiting behind me for a safe, courteous time to overtake are driven by women, the cars which breenge past far too fast and close are driven by men. The advantage is that you probably won\u2019t be in the wrong, and won\u2019t have a collision. It means I need approval from others, though. There are advantages to the reflexive self-righteousness: you never need to think about second-guessing yourself, and nothing bad usually happens because other people manage to clear up your messes or take evasive action before you smash into them. I used to see S every week or so, but have not for ages; but she has been to Woodbrooke and wanted to tell me about it. At one point I state something passionately, then half-apologise for it: \u201cThat was vehement,\u201d I say, feeling her out. Oh, she says, that\u2019s just the normal way of speaking, for her and her family. It is not for me. My passion is usually behind a diffident manner, which can be painful for me: I am restrained by my own fears. \u201cLike an elephant with a-\u201d I am miming a shackle round my ankle, but do not need to, because she got the allusion immediately. \u201cWe need to be with others to know ourselves, because we see ourselves reflected in them,\u201d she says. Yes. Of course. I am learning, now, from my interactions. I judge myself. I always ask, \u201cHow am I wrong?\u201d I know this from interaction, but I am a recluse because for so long I judged myself reflexively and unconsciously, so I was always wrong, all the time, and when I was hurt too much by interactions and could take it no longer I needed to hide away. Right now, I am having the interactions I can bear. From facebook: To state that zazen has a definite and particular form, and to cling to that position leads to one kind of trouble, while stating that zazen has no particular form sends one off in another confused direction. There is no logical resolution to this problem. And it is this illogical paradox with which a true practitioner of Zen must \u2018sit\u2019 both literally and spiritually. Yes. I reacted to that: it is seeking safety in rules- like I do. I am more or less happy cycling because I think I know the rules of the road, and what I am entitled to- it\u2019s a formalised interaction. If I said, \u201cNon-theists are not Quakers\u201d it is an attempt to find safety in rules. In this future situation, I will act in this way, and I will be right. S said, \u201cThat\u2019s why Quakers talk all the time\u201d- because human situations are so complex, so making rules is difficult. She said this not because she had seen that in facebook, but a propos of something else. Perhaps I am in a computer simulation, where the same lesson comes to me repeatedly, or perhaps I am just open to it now. Also on facebook, someone wrote,\u00a0  Anyone who was abused in their formative years is likely to feel they are \u2018a lesser being\u2019 than all others and may live in fear of rejection and abuse; so they will continually seek and need the approval of others. And on-going approval will also help dispel their fears of engendering further abuse. I felt myself completely worthless, so I do need approval: developing my own grudging acceptance, just-about approval for myself is difficult. Here is David Brooks on another aspect of needing the approval of others.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 13 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
