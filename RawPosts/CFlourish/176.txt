I thought I can\u2019t be with a woman as I am because it just feels wrong. I saw a documentary on TV and I didn\u2019t realise that women could transition into men so it was from that and realising how unhappy I\u2019ve been all my life, that\u2019s what I wanted to do. Oh God, I thought, that\u2019s just what gay people who want to drop the T from LGB say we are: it is internalised homophobia. I can only love a woman if I am a man. Being a lesbian \u201cJust feels wrong\u201d. I was bothered to hear this on Radio 4, Ovid in changing times. It also had an old interview with Jan Morris: -Is it not the height of arrogance to assume that, having your penis taken off you can say \u201cI am now a woman\u201d? -I have not said that. I am a person who felt self to be of feminine gender so adjust body to fit my inner feelings. Later we hear her say, I was in a difficult situation, not certain of myself, I tried to be more one or the other. Now I know just what I am, I\u2019m in the middle, really, I\u2019m a bit of each. It\u2019s a comfortable place to be. We adjust what we say about ourselves, to fit what others will accept. I don\u2019t know about \u201ccomfort\u201d. Possibly rather she felt reconciled to the journey, she was not resenting or fighting it. Though I loved her for this: -Are you ever able to stand up and see an element of absurdity? -No. I think it is beautiful. Of course I am absurd. We retain the concept of \u201cnormal\u201d, even if we recognise that Diversity is a good thing, and I am certainly not that. I wanted something which many would call ridiculous, and I cannot justify except that I wanted it, because it was the way I could best express who I am. Emotion is absurd, and therefore people are absurd. But I resent on her behalf that allegation of a lack of insight- \u201cAre you ever able\u201d. What arrogance in the interviewer, to suppose that one could only transition if one didn\u2019t understand. I think I am beautiful. But that line, being with a woman just felt wrong as he was. He talked of envying his male cousin\u2019s anatomy in the bath, as a child, and how being a girl had been bad enough but puberty was awful; so there are two narratives here. It strikes me he is trying to justify his change, to create as many arguments as he can, and that is one. And gay people would say of course a woman can be with a woman. It is not \u201cwrong\u201d. I would agree- but this trans man said it was wrong for him. If a gay person objected to trans on that ground, they are denying our existence, our ability to see our nature and make our choices. Phobic? Right back at you. It does not help that his voice sounded female. Not everyone\u2019s voice breaks properly on T. There is a trans man sound which some men have, a roughened alto, but his was completely female-sounding. The excerpt was without context, beyond that he was 39 at the time: I have no idea where he was on his transition journey. Narrator: Not every change works out. We are always striving after what is forbidden, Ovid wrote, and coveting what is denied us. ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 18 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
