A gay man does not conform to the male stereotype, which is heterosexual. He does not pretend to conform, if he is Out, and he is gay not as a matter of choice but because of who he is. His expression of himself as a gay man contradicts and subverts that male stereotype, whether he is conventionally masculine apart from his attractions, or not. More broadly, there would be more than two groups, whether you consider who people are, in their inward selves, or how we behave. There are those who fit fairly comfortably within the male stereotype, those who do not but pretend to, those who do not fit and do not conform, and those who transition. Those who pretend to fit are oppressed by gender- are they \u201ccis\u201d? For me, the word \u201ccis\u201d simply means \u201cnot trans\u201d. A cis gay man is someone who does not self identify as a (trans) woman, and presents as male, however camp. This is true whether Trans is something we are at the core of our being, so that I really am a woman, or a choice we make because transition is most comfortable, given the circumstances. I am trans because I have transitioned, even though I claim to be a feminine man who could not bear my attempt to conform to the male stereotype, so fled it. If \u201ccis\u201d simply means not trans, it can include gender non-conforming people, and those oppressed by the stereotype. There is some problem when we talk of \u201ccis privilege\u201d, which they have only to the extent that they pretend to conform, and we never have. \u201cPassing privilege\u201d is something different. There is a grey area with people who are perfectly androgynous in presentation- you can\u2019t always tell what gonads someone has, just by looking at them- but few people are in that grey area. Am I boring you? I am almost boring myself. I read the suggestion that \u201ccis gay man\u201d is offensive, somewhere on the internet, and must use my felicity with words to establish that that suggestion is hostile to trans people, and unjustified. I have a right to exist. I have a right to exist anyway, but now find myself in need of seeking to reassure myself of that. I can name me and not-me without being offensive! I wish gender non-conforming could cease to be a thing, just be part of ordinary human expression. It is a thing because someone finds it objectionable or surprising- a child in the playground, a colleague, a passer-by on the street- and expresses offence, or displeasure, or institutes some sanction; and because we are permanently hurt by such displeasure, and ever after inflict those sanctions on ourselves; or we go into fight mode, always alert for the displeasure and armed to resist it. THEY\u2019RE THE ENEMY! NOT ME! Oh God, it\u2019s frightening. The intolerant are the enemy, those who want to force us all into tiny gender conforming boxes, men, only ever attracted to women, never expressing any feeling but anger, and life would be so much easier if-  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 8 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
