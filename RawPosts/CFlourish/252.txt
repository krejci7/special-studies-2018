Tina, a counsellor who specialises in our kind, said this was very difficult. Such a person would confuse others which usually means angering or distressing them. We don\u2019t have the words concepts ideas for it. \u201cPansy\u201d or \u201ceffeminate\u201d men are expected to be gay. \u201cGenderqueer\u201d begins to approach it. For some of us, it might even be liberating to call ourselves men, and see another way of being: presenting as feminine men. The problem is that some espousing this view argue we are not women, we are wrong to dress as women, and deluded and oppressed into losing our gonads as the price of grudging acceptance as trans women. And I have been too close to that view. I am affected by my friend H who sees me as a man, and likes soft men as I like strong women, but \u201csees me as a woman\u201d as far as possible relationship goes. If only I had kept my testicles! I am seeking love and acceptance again. I seek to fit in. Beware those who offer acceptance on their own terms! Now, I reject that view. I am a woman, and chose gender surgery: I was happier than I had ever been. I could not have been a man in that way. I have been liberated. And I have been too close to the view that we are not \u201creally\u201d women. Women are not like that. Well, the concept \u201cwoman\u201d is broad enough to include me. Thank God. I hear that stuff, and it sets off echoes of self-doubt from the time of transition, because the acceptance of trans women was grudging then. Am I right to do this, I wondered. I picked over every possible doubt- if I had found any reasonable doubt I would not have done it. I remain ashamed of myself- it is the echo of the shame I felt then. Or- I am persuaded. Apart from cultural expectation there is no difference between men and women apart from reproductive organs. It is all a huge con. We are men, and should express ourselves as soft, gentle men. Beta males, perhaps. I distort myself into a female form and am mutilated, because of Patriarchal oppression. Those who think they are trans should be saved from themselves, and prevented from any bodily alteration. Or- The reason I can\u2019t admit that trans is a huge con is because I would have to admit I was wrong to choose to be mutilated. But really- I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t decide. Differing loyalties, among other things, pull me different ways: I am with these people, who say this; or those, who think the opposite. It would be easier if I knew- possibly I am depressed, failing to value my current way of being and my decisions. I am where I am.   \u2665\u2665\u2665 This is the thing. When she says \u201cI see you as a man\u201d because of radical feminist theory, I could bear it; but when she \u201csees me as a man\u201d except in the way of a possible partner, where she \u201csees me as a woman\u201d and herself as simply heterosexual, I find myself regretting my op. Because I love her. So I phoned the Samaritans, second time in two days, and was explaining the dynamic. The woman had not heard the word \u201charridan\u201d which is entirely negative. \u201cIt\u2019s not like \u2018bitch\u2019,\u201d I explained. \u201c\u2018Bitch\u2019 can be positive. \u2018Find your inner bitch\u2019.\u201d And I thought, yeah. Find your inner bitch. Bitch can be positive. I hated my body. I had it adjusted. And then I loved it. -Lots of women have a great deal of fun with penises, I told a friend when I was considering the Op. -Yes, but I would not want one of my own, she said. Various people say, but penises and testicles are wonderful, part of your humanity, part of your beautiful body. Do not mutilate your body. They can\u2019t understand it, and nor can I, for \u201cI am a woman\u201d is a rationalisation not an explanation, and their opinions affect mine, because I want to fit in- but we want this, and we have the right to make our own decisions. I want to find my inner bitch, find my power. I am weightless, blown by the winds.  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 26 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
