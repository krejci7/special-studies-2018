trans transition 
 What is transgender ideology? What do we believe? That we are human beings. That we have a right to exist, like black, white, gay, straight, disabled, working class, educated people have. That we are mostly harmless, and we should be allowed to live in peace. That we should be judged for the harm we as individuals do, if any, not for some myth or scare-story. And that’s it. There is a phenomenon, that people transition gender socially. It has been going on for millennia. Similar activity is observed in cultures round the world. People do it because we have to, despite social ostracism, reduced opportunities, and the threat of violence up to murder, because it is better than the alternative, because living in the gender assigned at birth is unbearable. We do it though we are frightened and doubting, though we are assailed by the hatred of Republican bathroom bills and the allegation of autogynephilia, that we are merely sexual perverts. We do it despite the physical changes we must undergo. We carry on though family rejects us. Most of the attempts at theorising why we do this come from outsiders, from scientists who study us or haters who fantasise about us. None is necessary: we transition because we must. And- what is a trans activist? A trans person saying something the accuser does not like; or a trans person just living their life. I am not a threat to anyone. I should be allowed to live my life. That is transgender ideology.
