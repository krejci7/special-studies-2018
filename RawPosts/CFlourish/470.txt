 Toddler is cried into silence. Mummy looks at toddler worriedly.  Mummy says, "Is there anything you want?"  Silence.  "Would you like a biscuit?" That was the pretext of the last battle. NO Mummy reaches out, and sets her off again.   NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO    I understand, I assure you. I need to get myself a job, get out among  people, earn money, support myself, get myself out of this stuckness.  Or do something I enjoy doing, cheer myself up, stop being so negative.  And all my   I WANT is capable of, all she can manage at the moment, is NO. In the sauna I complain my nipples are wrong, and get the standard  feminine response, that they are absolutely fine, that there is a huge  variation in nipples. And this upsets me more, because it is not relieving  this anxiety but devaluing my greater anxiety, that I look like a man,  I look like a tranny.  Or someone says "Your skin is so soft!" and I hear surprise, and I hear,  underneath, "You're a man, you're a tranny, how come your skin is so soft?"  Though perhaps that implication is not intended.   Lighting the fire,   fanning the flames-   I am, no, not normal, no-one is normal, but- Acceptable.  How can I take that into myself? How can I breathe it in?  It seems clearer, kneeling in my ritual space. It seems strengthened when I tap into the Universe to refresh my Qi.  So, despite the apparently intellectual objections, this cannot be real, this  cannot make sense, etc, etc, yada yada yada  I need to do that.
