"I am someone who is inhabiting a world in between genders.\u00a0 There is a growing set of words, a subculture of sorts, and there are political agendas surrounding this experience.\u00a0 And in theory, I am on board with all I\u2019ve seen (and let me clarify that what I\u2019ve seen is almost entirely online at this time, and not reflected in the world I actually live in).\u00a0 But in actuality, not every part of it appeals to me personally.\u00a0 Which is OK \u2013 I can still support it while simultaneously getting the word out that not all non-binary people have the same needs, preferences, and agendas.I\u2019m going to go with a break-down of three categories:\u00a0 Pronouns, Bathrooms, and Legal Designations / Forms.\u00a0 And talk a little about the discussions I\u2019ve seen, but also how I personally feel.Pronouns:\u00a0\u00a0 I prefer to be referred to with male pronouns:\u00a0 He/Him/His.\u00a0 The reason for this is:\u00a0 because it is my preference.\u00a0 It really is as simple as that \u2013 no explanation needed.\u00a0 It feels the most right (although no pronouns actually feel \u201cright\u201d for me).\u00a0 That\u2019s all it comes down to \u2013 a feeling.Many non-binary people go by They/Them/Their, along with a myriad of more obscure pronouns.\u00a0 Some people have assumed that I go by They/Them/Their, because I identify as non-binary.\u00a0 That is fine.\u00a0 It\u2019s not my preference, but I\u2019m not offended by this assumption, nor do I mind being referred to in this way.\u00a0 I have felt some pressure (from within myself only) to adopt the They/Them/Their/ set in order to align myself more with an idea of a non-binary identity, and to take a stand / stand-out more for what some people truly feel they need (which is to be referred to with gender neutral pronouns \u2013 it is definitely a need for some people).\u00a0 But, bottom line, it does not feel right for me.\u00a0 Male pronouns feel (more) right.(And I imagine if I really break it down, this correlates to how I see my gender:\u00a0 I do not feel as if I am without gender, genderless, agender, or gender neutral.\u00a0 Instead, I feel as if I am an amalgam of genders, a kaleidoscope.\u00a0 And so it feels right that I view my identity\u2019s make-up as pieces from all genders, rather than a rejection of anything that is gendered.)I have seen many preferred sets of pronouns online (such as Ze/Hir/Hirs, Ey/Em/Eir/Eirs, Xe/Xem/Xyr/Xyrs and also ones based off of nouns).\u00a0 But in actual real life, I have come into contact with only one person, so far, with a preference for a set like this \u2013 and I immediately proceeded to mess it up when talking out loud.\u00a0 I have met a couple of people who prefer They/Them/Their, and that feels immediately do-able in real life, because these are words we\u2019re all familiar with pronouncing.\u00a0 And\u2026 that\u2019s kinda the difference \u2013 much of the online world is written, it\u2019s visual.\u00a0 And it\u2019s easy to backspace and try again.\u00a0 The real world involves much more talking out loud, at a conversational pace, and I personally am a long way from incorporating these newish words naturally into a conversation.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not willing to.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t support it.\u00a0 It means, in practice, I have a lot of work to do.\u00a0 And that work is difficult to do if I do not have people in my life who want to be referred to in this way \u2013 it\u2019s hard to practice if I\u2019m not actively practicing, essentially.\u00a0 And, since I am someone who identifies as non-binary, I might be, in theory, someone on the most sensitive, most open, end of the spectrum, in terms of the general populous.\u00a0 I have a lot of trouble with it, from a practical perspective, at this time.To summarize:\u00a0 Incorporating these newer pronouns is do-able.\u00a0 I support it.\u00a0 For some people, it is not a preference, but a need, in order to feel comfortable.\u00a0 I personally do not need or prefer to be referred to by gender neutral pronouns.\u00a0 I have a long way to go in terms of enacting this language.\u00a0 Which, I believe, means the general population has a much longer way to go.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to make progress if I\u2019m not actively using the words in regular conversation.\u00a0 At this time, I am not actively using the words in regular conversation.\u00a0 This is where I\u2019m at with pronouns.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to gauge where the world at large is at, but I imagine progress will be very very slow.\u00a0 I\u2019m just thinking pragmatically here.\u00a0 Ideally, I wish it were easy.This got a lot longer than I thought it would.\u00a0 It\u2019s complicated!\u00a0 So again I\u2019m going to break the topics up; look forward to yet another series!\u00a0 Up next:\u00a0 part 2 \u2013 Bathrooms and part 3 \u2013 Legal Designations / Forms.\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 19 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
