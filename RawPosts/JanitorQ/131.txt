Do you feel like you were born into the wrong body? Are you living life as the opposite gender you were given at birth? Magilla Entertainment and a major cable network are now casting men and women who identify as the opposite gender and who are considering going through a transition for a new docu-series. If you have been struggling with your\u00a0gender\u00a0identity and want the support of a coach or mentor as you transition, we want to hear your story. If you think you are ready to embark on this journey, please contact us ASAP at\u00a0castingdirector@magilla.tv\u00a0with your name, age, location, occupation, contact phone number, a recent photo and a few sentences about yourself.I\u2019m glad for the increase in media representations lately and really hope they aim to showcase a diverse group of trans-people.\u00a0 Demonstrate that not all narratives are the same.\u00a0 (For example, point out that not every trans-person identifies with having been \u201cborn into the wrong body.\u201d\u00a0 Another example: a non-binary person!)\u00a0 And, most importantly, to convey these struggles with the deserved respect!\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
