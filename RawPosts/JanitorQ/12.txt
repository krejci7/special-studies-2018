three state-level civil rights complaints, trying to get her re-instated.\u00a0 I read about it in the newspaper while at work, yesterday.She was treating transgender students who came to her with a previous diagnosis.\u00a0 She was definitely qualified to do so, having gone through many hours of training in trans-health care, attending a conference sponsored by WPATH (World Professional Association for Transgender Health), etc.\u00a0 She was doing this at the college\u2019s expense, which just makes it seem like it was condoned by the college, right?!!WPATH\u2019s stance is, \u201cWith appropriate training, \u2026hormone therapy can be managed by a variety of providers, including nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and primary care physicians.\u201d\u00a0 Apparently, this was outside the scope of what the Student Health Center did, but this was never communicated to her.\u00a0 The termination came from out of the blue.Hormones are prescribed for other reasons at the health center, with no problem.\u00a0 Birth control, ovarian disease, and low testosterone are all treated regularly.Interestingly, the information on the Student Health Center\u2019s website changed two months after her firing:\u00a0 While it had said, \u201ccomprehensive primary care,\u201d and \u201ccontinuity of care,\u201d it now says, \u201cbasic primary care\u201d and has no mention of continuous care.\u00a0 At least they\u2019re being accurate about the downgrade???This just angers me to no end because this doctor took it upon herself to step it up and become well versed in an area that, for whatever reason, makes so many medical professionals so squeamish and stand-offish.\u00a0 And if this was something she did of her own volition, and it was well within the standards of care, then back it up!\u00a0 What was the university afraid of?\u00a0 There are standards in this field, despite the fact that the medical professions are grotesquely behind the curve with this, in general.\u00a0 A bunch of transgender students were left in the lurch.The college\u2019s associate vice president of student wellness was quoted as saying, \u201cWe are fortunate to be situated in [city], where there is a strong medical community rich with resources.\u201d\u00a0 As if to say that students can just go elsewhere.\u00a0 I\u2019ve tried \u201celsewhere\u201d around here, as an adult, and it was a super-frustrating process.\u00a0 If I think back to who I was at age 18 or 19, disrupted care at the on-campus center in this regard would have definitely sent me into a tailspin and/or mental health crisis.\u00a0 I would have felt like I didn\u2019t have the means or psychic energy to find out another path.\u00a0 I would have felt deeply cut, in a personal way, by my institution\u2019s sudden change in policy.It just seemed like this college was at the forefront \u2013 it could have laid the groundwork for other area places of higher education to follow.\u00a0 And then it just took a huge leap back into the wrong direction.\u00a0 One step forward, two steps back sometimes I guess, right?I had a bunch of problems with getting continuous care.\u00a0 I was first getting hormones from a sketchy-ass doctor.\u00a0 I finally felt so disgusted with his practice that I sought out another path.\u00a0 I went to one specifically because she was listed as being LGBT friendly and knowledgeable.\u00a0 That ended up being wrong basically \u2013 she told me she didn\u2019t know how she had gotten on that resource list.\u00a0 I had to have a pretty heated conversation with her \u2013 her stance first was that I could come to her for primary care, but I should continue to get my hormone prescriptions through that other doctor.\u00a0 I told her I wasn\u2019t going to do that.\u00a0 She told me this was beyond her scope and if she had a male patient with low-testosterone, she would not even monitor him for that reason.We finally landed on a compromise.\u00a0 She would continue to prescribe what I was already at, and she would monitor that.\u00a0 If I wanted to make any changes though, I would have to do that through other means.When I did want to make other changes, I first got on a long waiting list for an LGBT-specific clinic.\u00a0 I kept hearing negative stories about the quality of care there, so I decided to also try another approach:\u00a0 an endocrinologist.\u00a0 I had to get on a long waiting list for that, as well.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been going there since January, and so far, I\u2019m happy because I don\u2019t have to deal with the PCP anymore.\u00a0 Getting an endo was not like adding yet another medical professional and another series of appointments.\u00a0 It was more like, instead.\u00a0 Unless I get like, a rash or something, then I\u2019d go back to my\u00a0PCP.All of this was hard enough, and I am an adult who has worked really hard at advocating for myself.\u00a0 Thinking back to who I was as a student I would have withered under this kind of stress.\u00a0 Students need to be able to access trans-specific care on their campuses.\u00a0 Period.A note about the lack of specifics in this post:\u00a0 I left out the doctor\u2019s name and the name of the college, city, etc. because that\u2019s been the way I\u2019ve always operated with this blog, in order to keep some anonymity.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure anymore whether it\u2019s all necessary, but I\u2019m not about to try to figure that out here-and-now.\u00a0 If you\u2019d like specifics and the names of the sources I got a lot of this information from, just leave a comment, and I\u2019ll get back to you!\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
