lately because I\u2019ve been working a series of 12 hour shifts at my real job \u2013 filling in for my supervisor plus doing my own work.\u00a0 But that\u2019s not really what I\u2019m writing about right now\u2026For a few years, I was very much disconnected from the trans* community, and I\u2019ve been recently back in some big ways (online at least\u2026 for now).\u00a0 Where was I from roughly 2007-2013?\u00a0 Why was I not involved?\u00a0 How was I involved before that time period?\u00a0 Why did I decide to come back?\u00a0 These questions are basically teasers for right now.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be elaborating on all of that in the near future, but in this moment, I want to focus on some things that have changed in that short time period, linguistically speaking.When I started to dip my toes back in the water, I started at\u00a0LiveJournal, a space I\u2019m familiar with and had been an active contributor in the past.\u00a0 I joined a group that\u2019s all about non-binary identities but was quickly confused by a bunch of phrases and acronyms I\u2019d never encountered before.\u00a0 I had no idea what AFAB/AMAB, FAAB/MAAB, DFAB/DMAB, CAFAB/CAMAB* stood for, or why there was an asterisk now attached to the word \u201ctrans*.\u201d\u00a0 The most commonly used gender-neutral pronouns, last I was aware, were \u201cze/hir/hirs.\u201d\u00a0 In fact, I hadn\u2019t even heard of any others, not even \u201cthey/them/their.\u201d\u00a0 !!!\u00a0 I\u2019d never come across the honorific, \u201cMx.\u201d\u00a0 I had not heard of the terms \u201cneutrios,\u201d \u201cagender,\u201d or \u201cbigender,\u201d although these were easy enough to figure out.\u00a0 In fact, in the past, I had identified (and I still identify) as genderqueer, but at the time, I strongly wished there was a better word\u00a0 (and maybe it was there, all along \u2013 I just wasn\u2019t aware of it).\u00a0 I would have definitely identified as \u201cagender\u201d or \u201cneutrois\u201d if I\u2019d been familiar with those words then.\u00a0 Now, not quite so much.(I\u2019m getting bogged down by trying to link everything!\u00a0 Here is an additional good resource, and I\u2019ll just leave it at that.\u00a0 Nonbinary.org\u00a0 The internet is, you know, pretty search friendly anyway.\u00a0 You can do the work yourself, haha.)Coincidentally, I came across a book at the library last week, called Uncharted:\u00a0 Big Data as a Lens on Human Culture.\u00a0 I\u2019m only 36 pages in, but it\u2019s already one of the most interesting books I\u2019ve EVER read.\u00a0 Highly recommend!\u00a0 (If you\u2019re into quantifying things and looking at social trends.)\u00a0 Basically, the authors teamed up with Google and created this website.\u00a0 Google has been digitizing over 30 million books over the past 10 years, and they\u2019re just getting started.\u00a0 What that provides (among many things), is a database for how frequently words and phrases are used within languages and over great spans of time.\u00a0 And these guys came up with a search engine lens to chart this stuff.\u00a0 I decided to see what a graph would look like between 1980 and now (it cut me off at 2008, unfortunately) for the phrases \u201cfemale-bodied\u201d vs. \u201cFAAB\u201d vs. \u201cAFAB.\u201d\u00a0 It looks like this:\u00a0(You can click on it for a clearer image)What does this all mean?\u00a0 Well, it means we can look at how words and phrases shift over time.\u00a0 (We can also see how infrequently these words/phrases are used, but that\u2019s beside the point, a little bit\u2026)\u00a0 It\u2019s incredibly exciting to me that I could have been out of the loop for roughly 6 years \u2013 a very short time, relatively speaking \u2013 and when I came back to these dialogues, there was a bunch of new terms I\u2019d never heard of!\u00a0 The trans* umbrella is an amazingly rich and dynamic area of changing identities, linguistics, politics, health initiatives, etc.\u00a0 It feels like there are endless things for me to write about and stay up to date with!\u00a0 Let\u2019s continue discovering\u2026________________________________________________*What do all these acronyms stand for?!!\u00a0 Well!\u00a0 here is the long string:\u00a0 Assigned female at birth / Assigned male at birth, Female assigned at birth / Male assigned at birth, Designated female at birth / Designated male at birth, Coercively assigned female at birth / Coercively assigned male at birth.\u00a0 These terms are gaining traction over \u201cFemale-bodied, Male-bodied,\u201d which was previously the dominant way to describe someone\u2019s birth sex, I believe\u2026\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013
