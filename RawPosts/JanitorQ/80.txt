And I don\u2019t tweak my nipples \u2013 I cover the whole area with my hands.I don\u2019t really feel anxious or excited, at least not yet.\u00a0 I\u2019d be into the idea of getting through this without either or those emotions \u2013 we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 It helps to read other accounts of impending surgery thoughts and feelings.\u00a0 Such as this post:\u00a0 Last Minute Concerns, from over 5 years ago.\u00a0 And recountings of the process, such as this post, from yesterday:\u00a0 It\u2019s Never Too Late.I only have 3 more days of work.\u00a0 Then I won\u2019t be back till probably August.\u00a0 That\u2019ll be weird.\u00a0 I wonder what my days will look like, once I\u2019m recovered enough.\u00a0 Will I feel like being creative and getting stuff done, or will I end up just hanging out?\u00a0 We\u2019ll see \u2013 I\u2019m not going to make it be anything in particular.Other stuff has been going on too.\u00a0 My spouse and I visited some extended family on my dad\u2019s side last weekend, most of whom she had not yet met.\u00a0 I sent an email to as many people as I could in advance just mentioning my name change and that I go by male pronouns.\u00a0 I received only one reply, and my expectations were pretty low.\u00a0 Surprisingly though, everyone who said my name used my new name, and there were zero slip ups.\u00a0 It was awesome.\u00a0 I think this\u2019ll help my dad get on board!\u00a0 (He is getting there, slowly\u2026\u00a0\u00a0 \u2026\u00a0\u00a0 very slowly\u2026)\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
