In Letters for My Siblings, we wish to capture short pieces of a similar spirit from people who are genderqueer, gender non-conforming, bigender, agender, or who simply don\u2019t fit nicely into the boxes of \u201cman\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d.Your submission should be between 500 and 2500 words and address one or more of the prompts below.Not all prompts will apply to all writers. Your submission should be about your own lived experience \u2014 please avoid delving too far into the theoretical, or making broad generalizations about any group (even one that you belong to).Send all submissions to lettersformysiblings@gmail.com by February 1, 2014. Authors will be notified of acceptance within six weeks of the submission deadline.\u2022 What does it mean to transition as a non-binary identified person? How have you transitioned medically, legally, socially, or otherwise, and why? Has your transition been an important part of your identity and/or experience? How and why?\u2022 Where do you fit in the larger trans* community? Have you found friendship and connection among other trans* people, binary or non-binary? Have you encountered discrimination or resistance to your identity within the trans* community?\u2022 Have you been able to find or create language to describe your gender/experience? Are you intentional about using (or NOT using) particular words for your gender / experience? Why do you use (or not use) these?\u2022 How has your non-binary identity intersected with other parts of your identity, such as your race, class, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, physical ability/disability, or age? Are there times when these other parts of your identity come in conflict with your gender? If so, how do you manage these conflicts?\u2022 What do you like about being non-binary? What is your biggest frustration? How do you navigate a world set up only for men and women?\u2022 Who are your mentors? Who has guided you on your journey / transition? Who do you look up to?\u2022 What advice would you give to genderqueer/gender non-conforming/non-binary people who are at the beginning of their journey?As compensation for their contribution, all authors will receive a free copy of the anthology upon its publication. Transgress Press will donate all proceeds to organizations benefiting trans communities (www.transgresspress.com/our-donations).We look forward to hearing from you!\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 22 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
