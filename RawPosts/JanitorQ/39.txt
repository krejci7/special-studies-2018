Also, spoiler alert for this super obscure film that is probably hard to find, but totally worth it!My spouse and I just saw The Lure, a Polish film re-envisioning The Little Mermaid (meaning Hans Christian Andersen much more so than Disney, although there are elements from both). \u00a0It takes place in the 1980s, and these particular mermaid sisters are vampiric vamps who come ashore in order to perform as singers/dancers/strippers. \u00a0One of them also joins Triton\u2019s punk rock band. \u00a0There is no sea witch in this version; instead, they are exploited by the humans around them, for their talents. \u00a0The director likened them to\u00a0\u201cimmigrants, abused by the locals (used in the sex industry) on their way to their real goal\u2014America.\u201d \u00a0I didn\u2019t quite catch that hidden meaning, although that\u2019s super interesting; I guess I was looking at it through a trans-specific lens, and I saw a bunch of parallels that resonated.The two sisters have two very different focuses/goals. \u00a0\u201cGolden\u201d wanted to perform and find her way to America. \u00a0\u201cSilver\u201d falls instantly in love with the young bass player at the nightclub. \u00a0Golden, very early on, warns her sister, something along the lines of, \u201cwould you be willing to eat him if need be?\u201d \u00a0While on land with legs, the mermaids have no sexual or excretory organs. \u00a0They\u2019re paraded around, and it\u2019s said\u00a0that they\u2019re \u201cas smooth as Barbies.\u201d \u00a0When water is splashed on them (Think, 80s movie, Splash !!) and their tails re-emerge, they do have a \u201cvagina\u201d of sorts \u2013 it\u2019s just super unconventional. \u00a0Also, they have a strong fishy smell (d\u2019uh!), and another quote from the director, \u201cthey represent innocence,\u00a0yet their odour and slime recalled girls maturing, they menstruate, they ovulate, their bodies start smelling and feeling different.\u201d \u00a0The reason I\u2019m focusing in on this in particular is because it is Silver\u2019s motivation for what she does throughout the rest of the story. \u00a0She does want to marry the bassist, but even more clearly, she wants them to have sex, and he won\u2019t, the way that she is. \u00a0There is a really graphic surgery scene where she loses her tail and gets new, permanent legs, fully formed with vagina and everything else. \u00a0She gives up her singing voice, as a trade off. \u00a0There then is a sex scene, which does not go as planned. \u00a0And then, OK I\u2019m going to leave it at that, to not give away anything more!I related to this sexual conundrum, as a trans-person. \u00a0Not literally, of course, but, in a way. \u00a0Just to cover the base-line, in general, trans-people feel all sorts of ways about sex and sexuality and their own anatomy. \u00a0It really is all over the\u00a0map, from person to person. \u00a0And, as well, I\u2019m sure, there are cis-people who feel a total disconnect, for a variety of reasons. \u00a0So it\u2019s not really a \u201ctrans-specific issue,\u201d but, overall, it is surely more common among trans-people. \u00a0Following that disclaimer, I\u2019m actually only speaking about my personal experience in the next couple sentences. \u00a0I do not relate to what I have. \u00a0And I never did. \u00a0I\u2019ve created some work-arounds, in my head, over time, that have helped. \u00a0And I\u2019ve been able to become more present, which is nice. \u00a0But I still get hung-up. \u00a0And upset that there\u2019s not a whole lot I can do about it.I\u2019m not the only one, by far, who is making this connection between trans-people and mermaids. \u00a0If you are familiar with Jazz Jennings, 16 year old trans-activist, author, spokesmodel, youtube celeb, etc., she has linked the two in some very strong ways. \u00a0She even has a company called Purple Rainbow Tails, through which she sells mermaid tails she\u2019s made herself raising money for trans-kids. \u00a0I found a really interesting article that touches on Jazz and mermaids called, Transgender Mermaids. \u00a0Here\u2019s a quote from it!Of course, the question that most people ask is \u201cWhy mermaids \u2014 why not some other animal or creature?\u201d The reasons may be varied and complex, and they may vary with each girl. However, a common theme is that mermaids may hold a special appeal because they have a high level of human feminine facial features and upper body features while having a lower body that isn\u2019t that of a traditional human female. Many transgender girls may relate to this because they know that they are truly females no matter what their genitalia may be.Also, Mermaids UK is a support resource and advocacy group that has been around since 1995(!!!) focused on helping transgender kids and adolescents, and their families.I was once in a really obscure play, a reworking\u00a0and twisting of the children\u2019s play, If Boys Wore the Skirts. \u00a0The original was \u201ca\u00a0satire on what may happen if women continue to copy the clothes that men wear. According to this play, in self-defense the men may take to wearing feminine things. Here we see a bunch of rugged males forced into skirts. The setting is a schoolroom in the present.\u201d \u00a0(Present, meaning 1958.) \u00a0The version that I was in was a mature audiences, tripped-out dream-like version. \u00a0As one of the \u201cschoolboys,\u201d I got to imagine and create my own genital-themed skirt, called a \u201cgroinment.\u201d \u00a0I had such a blast with this, probably much more than anyone around me could have known! \u00a0I\u2019ll leave you with two images of what I came up with:\u00a0I pulled out the ol\u2019 skirt and water-balloons this weekend, to get a photo of this creation. When I looked back at the pictures from the actual show, however, I realized I\u2019d done a different water balloon configuration, haha. Either way works\u2026This is from the fashion show scene. I\u2019m gonna spell out what I got going on here: There\u2019s a highly delicate water balloon configuration at the top of the water slide. These pointy party hats are there to protect it. And in my right hand is a needle: I\u2019m the only one who gets to \u201cpop\u201d it. (And I did, and the water actually did follow along the slide!)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
