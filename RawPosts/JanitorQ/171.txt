we would not do it again!\u00a0 It was a different kind of experience for me; I was on a natural high for so long, it was starting to get tedious.\u00a0 I mean, I\u2019ve had a lot of extreme highs and lows in moods, over much longer periods of time, but this was somehow different.\u00a0 Somehow much less scary.\u00a0 I felt confident that even though I felt this way, I could depend on myself to do whatever it was I needed to do.\u00a0 It was a high that was not really all that fun, in its duration.\u00a0 Maybe I am growing up.High extended roughly, from Thursday (kicking the planning for Saturday into high-gear,) till Tuesday (by then, we were in Northampton, MA for the start of our vacation, and the long drive to get there felt like it happened in a snap.)\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t hungry; I wasn\u2019t sleeping well.\u00a0 I was able to just keep going and going and going regardless.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t particularly feel euphoric or excited (I mean, I did at times, but not sustained.)\u00a0 I basically started feeling like all I wanted was to get a full night\u2019s sleep, an entire meal in my stomach, and to come down from wherever up-in-the-clouds I was.On our vacation, we stopped through Northampton and Spencer, MA before heading up to a tiny town (talking about a town with a church and a convenience store.\u00a0 No gas station.) in central Maine.\u00a0 We stayed with two friends who have an awesome cabin they\u2019ve basically created themselves, over the past 10 years.\u00a0 It sits on 50 acres of land, and they live there part time.\u00a0 We went blueberry picking (organic!\u00a0 $1.50/lb!!!), swimming in a very cold lake (when the air temp + rain hitting lake was even colder), trouncing through the woods a bit.\u00a0 We kicked back, did some reading, connected with our friends, and heard stories about / met some of their neighbors.At a rest stop on the way up there, I did an awkward dance with an older woman over the fact that I was in the women\u2019s bathroom.\u00a0 She spun around to walk back out and check if she was in the right one, sort of touching my shoulder to prevent a collision between us, saying she\u2019s checking that this is the right bathroom.\u00a0 I smiled and said, \u201cYep, it is.\u201d\u00a0 This, surprisingly, does not happen to me often at all.\u00a0 I can\u2019t even remember the last time.\u00a0 I enjoyed the experience (since it wasn\u2019t threatening or uncomfortable, was in a way validating.)On our way back home, we stopped to stay in a tree-house!\u00a0 And on our way from Maine to this tree-house, my partner read aloud an article from the August 4, 2014 edition of the New Yorker (p.24 \u2013 \u201cWhat is a Woman?\u00a0 The Dispute Between Radical Feminism and Transgenderism\u201d).\u00a0 I\u2019ve never picked up a New Yorker before.\u00a0 (I think maybe my partner hasn\u2019t either, because she commented, \u201cThere are a lot of comics in here!\u201d\u00a0 Haha.)\u00a0 It had been given to us by our friend in Maine, because she knew we\u2019d be interested in this one article.Imagine driving on winding roads through rural VT, rain coming down, having previously been bored out of my gourd, tired of our musical selections.\u00a0 And suddenly being fully engaged in this topic that seemingly came out of nowhere (I mean, I know it came from the New Yorker; I just mean I wasn\u2019t prepared for it, but it surely was a much needed distraction right then.)\u00a0 At various points, I interrupted my partner to argue passionately both with the article itself and with the radical feminists the article was about.Some of the gists:\u2013 Not all, but some radical feminists still feel that transwomen are not women and will never be women (and that they benefit from male privilege\u2026?).\u00a0 These rad-fems continue to want to exclude transwomen from women-only spaces, and to invalidate their experiences in numerous other ways.\u00a0 They reject the notion that someone could feel intrinsically female or male, and that all the ways that women and men are different are due to sociological forces and learned experiences only.\u2013 The common term for these rad-fems is TERF (trans-exclusionary radical feminists).\u2013 Some TERFs are detransitioners, and TERFs often cite detransition as proof of the fallibility of transgenderism.\u00a0 (Expert reports state that the percent of people who detransition is somewhere between 1% and 5%.\u00a0 This is higher than I would guess, but hardly significant enough to attempt to build a case.)\u2013 Some TERFs face threats, both in their personal and professional lives.\u00a0 Situations have become so escalated at times, that they must be escorted by security to events and go underground in their academics.There was so much more to this article (such as why FTMs are OK, but MTFs are a threat -???\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019ll return to the article for a more in depth future post); I highly recommend seeking it out if you can.\u00a0 It was eye-opening for me because even though I\u2019ve heard of this term (TERFs) and understand the basics of the arguments, this really painted a picture.\u00a0 On the one hand, TERFs\u2019 arguments are terribly weak and seem fueled by fear and a lack of understanding, with no efforts to begin understanding.On the other hand, I find myself empathizing (just a little.)\u00a0 \u201cTERF\u201d is not a self-describing term.\u00a0 It is essentially yet one more slur, coming from others in sexual/gender minorities \u2013 people all too familiar with slurs themselves, usually.\u00a0 These women have fought passionately (sometimes for decades and decades, creating groundbreaking groundwork) for changes in the view of what it means to be a woman, and now they\u2019re kinda in over their heads here.\u00a0 One final passage from the article that really sums up how this sub-group of rad-fems must feel,\u201c[These] radical feminists find themselves in a position that few would have imagined when the conflict began:\u00a0 shunned as reactionaries on the wrong side of a sexual-rights issue.\u00a0 It is, to them, a baffling political inversion.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
