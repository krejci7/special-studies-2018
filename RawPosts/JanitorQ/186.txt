I admitted myself voluntarily to a psychiatric hospital.\u00a0 I thought I was going to go there for a day or two, be able to finally catch my breath, and then work with those around me to make a plan for what I needed.\u00a0 This is not what ended up happening.\u00a0 I still wanted to leave after a day or two \u2013 that didn\u2019t change \u2013 but suddenly, things were getting really confusing really fast, and lots of people had other plans for me.\u00a0 Since I was still a minor, I really had no say in what happened.\u00a0 I was there for 19 days.\u00a0 I was put on 3 different medications.\u00a0 I was told I suffered a psychotic break.\u00a0 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (based on how I was behaving \u2013 short-term \u2013 and things I told them, such as, \u201cI think I am bipolar\u201d).\u00a0 When I left, I spiraled into a major depressive episode that lasted about 4 months (and I felt highly unstable for years to come).\u00a0 This helped confirm for me that I was, in fact, bipolar.\u00a0 Something I believed for about 6 more years.I am most definitely not bipolar.\u00a0 I did go through a psychotic break, but in retrospect, I believe this could have been prevented had I not been hospitalized.\u00a0 I think, ultimately, I just had an extended panic attack.\u00a0 And having no idea what that was or felt like, I thought going to the hospital was the only thing I could do to help myself in the moment.For the next 6 or so years, I complied with my mental health care.\u00a0 I took all my medications every day, as they were prescribed (and those meds and dosages changed a lot over the years).\u00a0 I went to all my appointments I was supposed to go to.\u00a0 I talked to therapists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, psychiatrists.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t seem to be improving.\u00a0 In a lot of ways, my mental state was getting worse.\u00a0 I just followed along with the treatment plan because I didn\u2019t know what else I could do.\u00a0 In fact though, I couldn\u2019t really tell you what the treatment plan was.\u00a0 Was there a plan?\u00a0 I don\u2019t recall that being a conversation.All of these experiences have greatly shaped who I am, and also my attitudes toward health care providers.\u00a0 I\u2019ll say right now, I am definitely biased and wary.\u00a0 Once I decided I wasn\u2019t going to take medications that didn\u2019t seem to help, and I wasn\u2019t going to listen to ideas that didn\u2019t seem to make sense for me, there really was no going back.\u00a0 Pretty much dropped out completely (except for going to a dentist and a chiropractor, haha) for a very long time.Until I decided I wanted to access testosterone.\u00a0 I thought I was going to need \u201cThe Letter\u201d from a therapist, but in the end, the doctor I went to didn\u2019t care about formalities like that.\u00a0 (He\u2019s also a sketchy doctor though.)I feel very adamant that I should be able to easily access testosterone for the rest of my life.\u00a0 Testosterone is doing for me what antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics never quite did.\u00a0 And more.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to go through hassles to be able to get it.\u00a0 I\u2019d go as far as to say that being challenged about it by a health care professional is highly triggering for me.\u00a0 Because when I was younger, I was told what would be best for me for so long, and I followed.\u00a0 And it was shitty.\u00a0 So now the dynamic is going to be the other way around.\u00a0 I know that\u2019s extreme and reactionary, but I do feel that strongly at this point in time.\u00a0 I hope that as I age, I will mellow out about it.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure there will be times that I\u2019ll need help and I won\u2019t know what is going on with my body, and I will be grateful for doctors\u2019 and specialists\u2019 expertise.\u00a0 As for now though, I\u2019m not there yet.Although my experiences with mental health professionals have been shaky at best, I believe strongly in the therapeutic effects of\u2026 well, therapy (haha).\u00a0 Without having been in therapy through those toughest years, I would not be where I am today, no question.\u00a0 I learned how to talk and communicate from therapists.\u00a0 I learned how to stop being so hard on myself.\u00a0 I learned to let go of my past.\u00a0 I learned that I cannot save others from their pain.\u00a0 I learned what things really matter in life, and what things I am spending wasted energy on.\u00a0 It was the slowest imaginable process.\u00a0 None of these gems felt like they were working for me at the time, but in returning to therapy over these past 2 years, it all started to suddenly sink in, and I\u2019ve made some real leaps and bounds.\u00a0 I feel grateful for that groundwork I started in my late teens and early twenties, through therapy, even though I could not feel the benefits whatsoever at the time.Two years ago, I attended a workshop at the Philadelphia Trans-Health Conference called, Who Needs Therapy?\u00a0 Some Thoughts on Mental Health and Gender Variance.\u00a0 It was largely an open discussion format, with a mix of mental health professionals, people with experience being in therapy, mental health survivors, and others.\u00a0 Toward the end I had worked up the courage to ask the group, \u201cWhat if I really connect with my therapist, but it is clear she is not knowledgeable about trans* issues?\u00a0 Is it worth it to continue working with her if I want to explore this?\u00a0 Is it up to me to attempt to point her to resources if I want to keep working with her?\u201dEveryone who responded to me was very adamant that it was not up to me, and if she does not do the work on her own, I should find someone who is knowledgeable or who is immediately and clearly willing to do the work.\u00a0 It turned into a very impassioned discussion with a lot of people saying the same things.\u00a0 I left feeling really confused.It had been very hard for me to find a therapist I click with.\u00a0 I\u2019d gone to a few in my mid/late-twenties, and felt really dispirited.\u00a0 A couple of them were specifically gender therapists.\u00a0 In the end, I returned to the main therapist I saw through some of my toughest years.\u00a0 It was amazing to me she is still around and I could find her.\u00a0 Re-connecting with her again after 8 years was mind-boggling in the best way possible.\u00a0 Despite the feedback I got at that workshop, I wasn\u2019t about to let go of her so easily.\u00a0 Nor did I feel like educating her myself, or even asking directly what she did know and what she did not know.\u00a0 I just continued to tell her how I feel, and I didn\u2019t ever get the impression that she didn\u2019t understand or wasn\u2019t going to work with me on that.\u00a0 However, when I asked her if she\u2019d write me a letter for HRT if need be, she said, \u201cNo.\u00a0 I don\u2019t feel like I have that expertise.\u201d\u00a0 And I appreciated that.\u00a0 It is all working incredibly well.When going to my new doctor, I could have possibly had an easier time if I was forthcoming with the fact that I\u2019m in therapy for gender issues (although I\u2019m not in therapy with a gender therapist).\u00a0 But I didn\u2019t feel like I should have to.\u00a0 So I didn\u2019t mention it.\u00a0 When the doctor asked me who is in my support network, I said my partner and my parents and friends.\u00a0 I left out my therapist.\u00a0 When she told me she would like to collaborate with the gender identity youth clinic in making a plan for me, I could have saved some time and hassles by saying, \u201cMy therapist already talked with them, and they won\u2019t see me because of my age.\u00a0 So the plan B is this.\u201d\u00a0 But I didn\u2019t.\u00a0 I just said, that\u2019d be great and let my doctor make the phone calls and come to that same conclusion on her own.Why?\u00a0 Because I think that therapy is an important part of my well-being.\u00a0 And I think that getting the best medical care possible, for what I need, will also be an important part of my well-being.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t feel like the two necessarily need to have much to do with each other.\u00a0 Specifically, I don\u2019t want to suddenly be taken more seriously and be given what I need, gender-wise, because I am in therapy.\u00a0 I want what I say to be enough.\u00a0 I want to access hormones without it being known I\u2019m in therapy, if I can.I am deliberately attempting to lay some of the groundwork, saying that this is perfectly acceptable.\u00a0 Not all of us live within access to clinics or doctors who offer the Informed Consent model.\u00a0 But I feel like I am in a position where I can work to change that.\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 19 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
