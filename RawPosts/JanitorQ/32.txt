I wanted a narrative that spoke to my identity as a gay man. So that is how gay pirates came to be. I describe the EP as a series of lamentations and exaltation of a very gay love.\u201dYou can check it out here: \u00a0Evan WestfalThe music is fun and catchy; the lyrics are full of stuff like coy promises and sweet deceits, treasure chests and booty, tight shirts, resiliency, and a \u201craging sea of hormones.\u201d \u00a0My favorite is probably the title track.I asked him a couple of questions, because he\u2019s got a lot going on behind the scenes, and because I was really curious what it\u2019s like to live in Edmonton. \u00a0He said,If I had to explain Alberta to an American, I would say that, culturally, it\u2019s the Texas of Canada. Politically Alberta is fairly conservative, and it\u2019s also a Province that is rich in oil. A lot of our citizens are tradespeople that work on oil rigs.\u00a0 As for my city, Edmonton itself is a really cool city. A river valley runs through the centre of the city, it\u2019s rich in wildlife and flora. The city has a fantastic pride centre, and lots of other queer organizations. To answer your questions regarding weather and topography, Edmonton is really cold in the winters, and really hot in the summers. You are correct, the surrounding areas are prairies.The pride festival is really cool. Edmonton had it\u2019s first parade in the 1990\u2019s, and it was very small, and most of the participants wore bags over their heads to hide their identities. Flash forward to the millennium, and things have changed quite a bit. In the last few years our city hall has raised a pride flag, the Edmonton public school board was a marshall for the parade, and the Canadian Forces Base in Edmonton raised the pride flag. Each year over 30\u2019000 people attend the parade. This year the pride festival\u2019s theme is \u201cone pride many voices.\u201d The festival says they\u2019re taking strides to become more inclusive. I think this is a great approach, as pride could definitely stand to be more intersectional and welcoming.I asked what his musical background was, and also what instruments he plays / does he collaborate? \u00a0He said, My background with music begins with my schooling. I am a graduate of the Canadian College of Performing Arts, it\u2019s a musical theatre program in Victoria, British Columbia. I think you\u2019ll notice some heavy influences of musical theatre in my songwriting. I then decided to focus on commercial contemporary music, I achieved that through matriculating at MacEwan University. As a musician I\u2019ve had the opportunity to sing backing vocals for Josh Groban, to play for the opening ceremony for the Edmonton Pride Festival, I\u2019ve performed with Opera Nuova (an Edmonton based opera company), and I\u2019ve produced and performed in many cabarets. Right now I\u2019m working on a music video for my song \u201cGay Pirates,\u201d it should be out in a month or two. As for instrumentation, I play the piano and sing. On my track Gay Pirates, I wrote all the song, but I had some great musician\u2019s record with me. I have to send a thank you to my drummer Julissa Bayer, guitar player Andrew Brostrom, and Bassist David Pollock.He also mentioned that he volunteers with an outreach program called fYerfly, so I asked him to elaborate on that too:fYrefly is a great program. The name is an initialism that stands for: fostering Youth resilience energy leadership fun leadership yeah! You might notice the Y is capitalized, that\u2019s because youth are the most important part. fYrefly originated as a summer leadership camp for LGBTTQ2SIA+ youth between the ages of 14-24. I attended the program as a teen, and it changed my life. For the first time in my life I got to be surrounded by people like me, I got to share a sense of camaraderie, and I got to feel pure acceptance. I loved the experience so much that I spent over a decade volunteering for fYrefly.\u00a0 Every year it\u2019s a treat to see the difference the camp makes for youth.I\u2019m just going to repeat that acronym: \u00a0\u201cfostering Youth resilience energy leadership fun leadership yeah!\u201d \u00a0Haha, I love that! \u00a0Evan will be performing for the opening ceremony of the Edmonton Pride Festival, coming up on June 10th. \u00a0If you\u2019re able to get up there \u2013 I just looked it up, and for me, it\u2019s 34 hours away, by car! \u00a0It\u2019s up there!Also, related, here\u2019s one of the first posts I ever wrote \u2013 an experience I had at a wedding: Effeminate Pirate Orders Fruity Drink on Party Boat\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
