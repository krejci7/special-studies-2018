In response to open ended questions about mental health effects and motivations for binding, participants consistently affirmed that the advantages of binding outweighed the negative physical effects.\u00a0 Many participants said that binding made them feel less anxious, reduced dysphoria-related depression and suicidality, improved overall emotional wellbeing and enabled them to safely go out in public with confidence.\u201dThe first time I bound my chest, I used duct tape, for a drag show.\u00a0 This was about 10 years ago.\u00a0 I quickly moved on to ace bandages.\u00a0 Shortly after, a trans-friend gave me one of his old binders that had stretched too much for him to feel comfortable in.\u00a0 It was too big for me, but it was pretty effective anyway.\u00a0 Still, I didn\u2019t like it at all, preferring to just layer my shirts.\u00a0 Over the next 10 years, I\u2019ve purchased 2 binders from Underworks, and 3 binders that were actually almost tolerable, just compressing the breast region, and from the outside looking like a ribbed tank-top.\u00a0 Still, I didn\u2019t like it at all, and only very rarely wore any of these things.\u00a0 Like, if we were going out and then going to a movie, I might wear the binder, but as soon as we\u2019d get to the movie theater, I\u2019d go to the bathroom just to take the thing off, because it\u2019s not a huge deal, while sitting in the dark.If you\u2019re interested in another study about trans- and gender non-conforming people, Here\u2019s an interesting one that I summarized:\u00a0 \u201cA Gender Not Listed Here.\u201d\u00a0-Works cited: Sarah Peitzmeier, Ivy Gardner, Jamie Weinand, Alexandra Corbet & Kimberlynn Acevedo (2016): Health impact of chest binding among transgender adults: a community-engaged, cross-sectional study, Culture, Health & Sexuality.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
