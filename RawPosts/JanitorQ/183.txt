\u2013 I find this topic to be highly interesting and, again, I left with a sense that we\u2019d only scratched the surface.\u00a0 The guided discussion (when we got around to it) was very stimulating, but quite a bit of time was used up at the beginning of the session going around the room, introducing ourselves, and saying what brought us to this workshop.\u00a0 (I\u2019m talking about maybe half of the session was used up doing this.\u00a0 I understand the facilitators wanted everyone to be involved, and they genuinely wanted to know why we were there, but this approach took too long.)\u00a0 We then discussed diagnoses for insurance purposes, stigmas attached to diagnoses, the DSM and the ICD (the International Classification of Diseases \u2013 this was new to me!), and how things are done in different parts of the world.\u00a0 A woman from India stood up toward the end, and talked in an impassioned way about how none of this applies to her and her country.\u00a0 And she went into details about some gruesome conditions in India, where it would be accurate to still refer to modifications as undergoing a \u201csex change.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m glad she had the courage to tell us about it, from her own perspective.A Gender Not Listed Here \u2013 I\u2019m going to do a separate post about this workshop, soon, because I loved it so much.\u00a0 So, this is just a teaser about that.\u00a0 Haha.We also attended the Blender! Showcase after the conference, on Saturday night.\u00a0 There were some really amazing and intense performances, in the vein of spoken word, dance, and drag.My networking accomplishments:\u00a0 I actually talked to some people!\u00a0 This is kinda huge for me; I don\u2019t generally do this.\u00a0 I met Rhys Harper, a photographer raising funds to do a nationwide tour, a book, and art openings.\u00a0 I met and talked to two trans*guys from Transgress Press.\u00a0 I met Ezekiel of firsttimesecondtime.com!\u00a0 And I met two other internet friends, something I\u2019ve never before experienced.\u00a0 We even went out to dinner with an internet friend, along with eir partner and another friend, and our friend from Philly.\u00a0 It was cool!\u00a0 We ate dosas.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 19 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
