( To check liver functioning, and/0r cholesterol? \u00a0I forget.) \u00a0It was a hassle, at the very least. \u00a0But I did start getting very comfortable with it: \u00a0I was present, it barely hurt \u2013 I just looked away so I didn\u2019t have to see the vials filling up with blood.Because of this, probably, I was intrigued by the idea of donating blood. \u00a0I did it a handful of times between these ages (17-21), both at my high school and at my college. \u00a0It was one of the most bizarre things, in my opinion: \u00a0Here we are, a bunch of us, all laying down on cots. \u00a0Any one of us might pass out at any time, and that would cause a chain reaction for others to pass out too. \u00a0There are these nurses hovering over all of us, making sure we can stand up OK as if we are rising from the dead, with these baggies of blood tied to us. \u00a0They are on hand with cookie packets and juice boxes. \u00a0We can have as many as we want\u2026The one reason I stopped doing it was because I had a hard time maintaining the minimum weight requirement during college (110 lb). \u00a0I didn\u2019t have an eating disorder, per se, I just didn\u2019t have an appetite or desire for much of anything at all. \u00a0I also struggled with anemia.And self-injury too. \u00a0In that case, pain was my friend. \u00a0I guess I can best describe it as, I would work myself up into such a frenzy that cutting my skin felt like the only thing that would bring me down. \u00a0I was hyper-ritualistic about it. \u00a0It was a fairly common occurrence for years, but never \u201csevere.\u201d \u00a0And I don\u2019t do it anymore.Testosterone has changed my relationship to pain, for sure. \u00a0I\u2019ve written about that here: Differences In How I Experience PainHere\u2019s a quick excerpt (I wrote this somewhere around 3 years ago):Before I started taking testosterone, I had a peculiar, but not really uncommon, relationship to pain.\u00a0 In many cases, I derived pleasure from pain.\u00a0 I would create sensations of pain, within my control, in an effort to calm myself.\u00a0 Also, when I\u2019d hurt myself accidentally like for example, hit my arm on a doorway, I would feel alarm, followed by an adrenaline rush, followed by a pleasant soothing wave.Now?\u00a0 If I hurt myself, it hurts!\u00a0 If I accidentally ran into a doorway, it would not be pleasant in any way, shape, or form.\u00a0 I remember the first few times I got hurt in little ways, in the first couple of months of being on testosterone; I was so surprised by how much pain was coursing through my body.\u00a0 I just felt like, aaaaaah!\u00a0 I\u2019ve been swearing under my breath and feeling unnerved by how much stuff hurts.So what am I trying to get at? \u00a0I guess I just want to acknowledge that sticking yourself with a needle, in an ongoing way, is a really intense thing to do. \u00a0And it\u2019s totally understandable that some trans-people would just have a hard limit and say, \u201cI\u2019m not doing that.\u201d \u00a0For myriad reasons. \u00a0So at least there are other options:\u2013 Gels, patches, and creams (unfortunately, quite costly) \u2013 Sub-cutaneous injections (not as deep) \u2013 Stuff like Nebido that\u2019s injected every 3 months or soDoes anyone have experiences with switching methods? Doing self-injections feels like a badge of honor, but I\u2019m not quite sure that it feels like an \u201chonorable\u201d thing to do\u2026\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
