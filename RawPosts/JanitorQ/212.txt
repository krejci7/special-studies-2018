Especially for the boys\u2019, because technically I am female.\u00a0 This is very serious.Before I labor over that point, here\u2019s a little back story about my take on which bathroom I personally should be in:\u00a0 Over the holidays, I got to hang out with two out-of-town friends who are both trans*.\u00a0 They were both describing dreams they\u2019ve had where they went into an unaccommodating bathroom, like stalls were missing or it was more of an open locker-room vibe.\u00a0 And they asked my partner and me if we\u2019ve had public restroom anxieties, and we both replied, \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 And in that sense, it\u2019s true.\u00a0 I strongly feel myself to be non-binary and genderqueer (and my sense of self is closer to male than female), yet I really have no questions or reservations about which public restroom to use.\u00a0 If a gender-neutral or family one is available, I will use that.\u00a0 Otherwise, I will use the women\u2019s room.\u00a0 And if people are doing a double take or wondering if I should be there, that\u2019s kinda their problem.\u00a0 Because it\u2019s the bathroom I feel more comfortable in.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t always feel this way.\u00a0 I used to always feel very anxious about the whole endeavor of going into the women\u2019s room.\u00a0 Honestly, I\u2019m not sure what changed, other than the fact that I\u2019d rather be in there than in the men\u2019s room, and I\u2019d rather feel calm than anxious?What if, though, I were just a few degrees closer to feeling male and presenting masculine?\u00a0 And/or I felt more comfortable going to the men\u2019s room, but looked the way I look now?\u00a0 What would that mean for me at work?\u00a0 The whole system of safety according to separation of genders would be breaking down.\u00a0 Like, what if I were out at work, and asked for male pronouns and used the men\u2019s / boy\u2019s room?\u00a0 Would there be a lot of upheaval and confusion?\u00a0 Or would everyone be accepting and cool with it?\u00a0 I really can\u2019t make that call in advance, but it\u2019s interesting to think about, even on this basic level of which bathroom is it \u201csafe\u201d for me to be in at the same time with children?Daily, I have to be in and out of both bathrooms.\u00a0 And as of now, f I get a call that there\u2019s a problem in a boys\u2019 room, I gotta get out wet floor signs and yell into the doorway, \u201cAnyone in here?\u201d\u00a0 (I do this for the girls\u2019 room too, even though I don\u2019t technically have to.)\u00a0 If I\u2019m already in there and a boy walks in, I have to make a huge deal out of the fact that we are both in there.\u00a0 And I have to walk out immediately.\u00a0 This happened just yesterday in fact.\u00a0 I knew I was taking a chance, starting to clean the bathroom before school was out.\u00a0 A first-grader came in, and I had to be all, \u201cWait one second.\u00a0 Let me leave and then you can go in.\u201d\u00a0 He was really flustered and turned right around and was really hesitant about going in at all after I walked out.\u00a0 I had to repeat a couple of times, \u201cYou can go ahead now.\u201dWhy all the paranoia?????\u00a0 I follow this protocol because people can loose their jobs over shit like this.\u00a0 And a part of me understands it, from a safety standpoint.\u00a0 But at the same time, we are instilling and reinforcing really irrational fears and gender rigidity into kids!\u00a0 The situation is anxiety provoking, all around!During the majority of my shift though, I walk in and out of bathrooms without any hesitation because my co-worker and I are the only ones in the school.\u00a0 (There are evening activities most days, but everyone needs to go to designated bathrooms at those times.\u00a0 They can\u2019t just wander around the school.)This may sound kinda weird, but bathrooms are a good place to kill some extra time.\u00a0 I like to practice peeing standing up, without an STP device.\u00a0 (Basically because I don\u2019t have one; I\u2019m thinking about getting one.)\u00a0 Interestingly, I do this still in the girls\u2019 room.\u00a0 I never actually use the boys\u2019 bathrooms (it\u2019s been ingrained in me too).\u00a0 Also, bathrooms have mirrors, which used to come in handy when I was just starting to get into doing drag.\u00a0 I\u2019ve spent countless work hours listening to my mp3 player and practicing lip synching and dancing, in front of mirrors in the public restrooms.\u00a0 I like to use the mop handle as a microphone stand.\u00a0 It\u2019s pretty fun.Bathrooms end up being a microcosm for people\u2019s anxieties surrounding gender.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t totally get it.\u00a0 But I can attest to the fact that it is indeed taught and reinforced at a very young age.\u00a0 I can also attest to some differences between genders, based on the different states I find the bathrooms in or just trends and differences between the two, but that\u2019s sort of a different topic all together.\u00a0 And some of it is just plain gross.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 22 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
