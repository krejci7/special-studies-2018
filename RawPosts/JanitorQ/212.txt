(yes!)\u00a0 Do I want to? (not sure)\u00a0 Will others take me seriously? (not sure), etc.I do not generally pass as male.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve been on low-dose testosterone for almost 11 months, and I still don\u2019t pass.\u00a0 And I plan on being on it for the rest of my life without ever really passing as male.\u00a0 This is what I want; I\u2019m right where I want to be.\u00a0 Except, I feel more male than female, inside, and I want that recognized with male pronouns.\u00a0 Also, I just want to be more visible as being non-binary, and the visual/pronoun incongruence suits me.\u00a0 I could go my whole life without anyone guessing I\u2019m on T (I think).\u00a0 I know that I could go my whole life without being seen how I really feel.\u00a0 And that could be said for a lot of people.I (sort of) came out to my parents in November.\u00a0 I did this at that point only because I was getting married, and pronouns were going to be used, haha.\u00a0 C\u2019s family consistently uses male pronouns for me \u2013 that\u2019s how I was introduced, and how they know me.\u00a0 It\u2019s awesome!!!!!\u00a0 My family does not, and I\u2019d never brought it up to them.So, in preparation of the getting-married day, I told my parents, over dinner, that I don\u2019t feel like I am either gender, and I avoid pronouns when I can because none of them feel right, but when I have to use them, I prefer male pronouns.\u00a0 I said, \u201cSo, I wanted to tell you this because other people use male pronouns for me, and I wanted you to know why, so you would know what was going on.\u201d\u00a0 My mom was nodding emphatically the whole time I gave them the spiel.\u00a0 My dad was making eye contact with the TV rather than with me or my mom.\u00a0 I know he heard me, technically, but I know nothing beyond that.Yesterday, I was talking about coming out, in therapy.\u00a0 And I relayed/reviewed this scene with my parents (\u2019cause we\u2019d already gone over it, at the time it was happening), and my therapist looked surprised and replied, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t realize you had given them the soft sell!\u201d\u00a0 And when she said that, all I could do was visualize Soft Cell (see below) and stare at her, confused.\u00a0 It took me a while to register what she was saying.\u00a0 And I was all, Damn!\u00a0 \u2026but, she\u2019s totally right.These guys know how to keep a secret.My parents do not use male pronouns for me now that I\u2019ve explained this to them.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t ask them to.\u00a0 At this point, I don\u2019t actually expect them to because I haven\u2019t told anyone else within their circles, and even I think that would be too weird and uncomfortable for them.\u00a0 BUT!\u00a0 It has made me decide that I want to tell more family members and then start expecting that they will make the change for me.\u00a0 I know it will be hard and I will feel vulnerable.\u00a0 I know some people probably will be able to just switch with no problem, and some people may never actually do it, but that doesn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t ask.As of now, here\u2019s what I\u2019m looking at: Friends / Community \u2013 use male pronouns, I feel understood C\u2019s family \u2013 use male pronouns, I feel understood Work \u2013 use female pronouns, about half know I\u2019m married to a female, they probably all think I am a lesbian My mom\u2019s side of family \u2013 use female pronouns, all know I\u2019m married, they probably think I am a lesbian My dad\u2019s side of family \u2013 use female pronouns, use my birth name, no one knows I\u2019m married, they probably think I\u2019m a lesbian My mom \u2013 uses female pronouns, I feel understood (interestingly), knows I\u2019m on testosterone and how I identify My dad \u2013 uses female pronouns, I don\u2019t know what he thinks My bro \u2013 He\u2019s been living in Turkey for 3 years and I have not had much contact.\u00a0 In the past though, he has used male pronouns, I feel understood.I think that I have a lot of work to do.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 22 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
