if I start transitioning, my gut is telling me that I will be even more drawn to guys, and I will want to end our relationship in order to pursue that.I vividly recall, at one point, completely breaking down and telling her, while crying, that I was attracted to masculinity.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t seem surprised, or threatened; she didn\u2019t shut down.\u00a0 She stayed there with me, in that moment, and replied, \u201cone of the many pitfalls of being in a queer relationship.\u201d\u00a0 I appreciated that reply so much, in the moment.\u00a0 It felt like relief.\u00a0 Sometimes, I make things overly-fraught; she brings it back down to earth.She has since elaborated that she did indeed feel the heaviness of the situation.\u00a0 Although we weren\u2019t talking about all of this directly at the time, she recently told me that she knew.\u00a0 And that she was going to support me in transitioning (whatever that looked like to me) unconditionally, at the risk of losing me along the way.\u00a0 Wow.While trying to sort that out, some life changes occurred that vastly improved things.\u00a0 My partner got a new job, we shifted our approach to friendships, I went back to therapy.\u00a0 Our relationship improved by leaps and bounds.It was about two more years before I really found myself at that crossroads of needing to try testosterone (although I no longer planned to transition in that common-narrative way).\u00a0 That fear was still there.\u00a0 Although it felt like we had a solid foundation to work from, I worried, would things shift between my partner and me?\u00a0 Would I start to be drawn exclusively to men?\u00a0 Where would that lead us?\u00a0 I started testosterone anyway.Testosterone has changed things for me, but not in those ways I feared.\u00a0 I\u2019m attracted to my partner and also I\u2019m attracted to men.\u00a0 Sometimes I\u2019m attracted to women; mostly, I\u2019m attracted to androgyny and effemininity (effeminate men).\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what that all adds up to; I just call it \u201cqueer.\u201d\u00a0 The nature of attraction feels a little less cerebral, and a little more physiological than before.\u00a0 I like that.\u00a0 I think I still fall under the category of demisexual, for sure, but it does feel different.\u00a0 My partner and I talk about all of it.\u00a0 None of it is threatening to her.\u00a0 None of it feels worrisome to me.\u00a0 It\u2019s all just puzzle pieces, that, although not straightforward or common, make more sense to me than my sexuality has ever made sense before.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
