be a part of a group performance art piece, an interpretation of John Cage\u2019s Variations III.\u00a0 We were given a sheet of transparent plastic with 42 circles on it.\u00a0 Our task was to cut out each circle, take a 11 X 8.5 inch sheet of paper, drop the circles onto the white paper, clear any circles that landed outside of the paper and also any circle that wasn\u2019t overlapping with another circle.\u00a0 Then we took a photo of our \u201ccircle configuration.\u201d\u00a0 Mine looked like this: We were then supposed to distill this pattern into a \u201cscore\u201d that would span 2 hours (including 5 minute breaks for every \u201cevent.\u201d\u00a0 According to the directions, \u201cStarting with any circle, observe the number of circles which overlap it.\u00a0 Make an action or actions having the corresponding number of interpenetrating variables (1+n).\u00a0 This done, move on to any one of the overlapping circles, again observing the number of interpenetrations, performing a suitable action or actions, and so on.\u00a0 Some or all of one\u2019s obligation may be performed through ambient circumstances (environmental changes) by simply noticing or responding to them.\u00a0 Though no means are given for the measurement of time or space \u2026 or the specific interpretation of circles, such measurement and determination means are not necessarily excluded from the \u2018interpenetrating variables.\u2019\u00a0 Some factors though not all of a given interpenetration or succession of several may be planned in advance, but leave room for the use of unforseen eventualities.\u00a0 Any other activities are going on at the same time.\u201dSo, in less dense terms, 24 performers were given a space of roughly 4 feet by 6 feet, all in one big room.\u00a0 And we could do any activity we chose, for a length of two hours, off and on, as was guided by our circle permutation.\u00a0 So, basically, I had 9 circles which meant 9 events, and I tried to have each overlap \u201cdictate\u201d how each of the 9 events was structured.\u00a0 The performance was on December 1st.I decided mine would be about doing drag.\u00a0 There was really nothing else that made sense.\u00a0 Drag has been the only form of performance art I\u2019ve done, and I was excited to, in a way, deconstruct and leave up to chance, the way it played out.I brought an alarm clock radio with a tape player, 100 cassettes tapes all in a display case, 9 wigs & hats, 4 skirts, 2 pants, one dress, a bunch of shirts and coats and belts and cumberbunds, 4 shoes & boots, a makeup bag, 4 \u201cmicrophones,\u201d a mirror, a blow dryer, and a hair buzzer.\u00a0 I think I was the performer with the most \u201cstuff,\u201d and over the course of 2 hours, I proceeded to make a mess of all of it, within my space.\u00a0 This was reminiscent of any time I would do drag.\u00a0 After a show, my room would be a disaster of dress-up options.So, for each of the 9 events, I threw \u201ccircles,\u201d onto the ground (including cds, tokens, bracelets, and mason jar rings).\u00a0 I then pretended to have these circle formations dictate what I wore and what tape I played.\u00a0 In a vague sense.\u00a0 It all did work out in the end \u2013 I had 9 different outfits and 9 different songs, all chosen at random.\u00a0 Some of those included REM \u2013 Drive, XTC \u2013 Summer\u2019s Cauldron, Tears for Fears \u2013 Shout, and Kate Bush \u2013 Jig of Life.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know these songs by heart, so I just pretended to lip-synch.\u00a0 Due to the cacophony in the room though, I was the only one who could hear the clock radio anyway \u2013 I had to hold it right next to my ear!Other peoples\u2019 actions included baking things, bicycling, playing instruments, creating play-dough art, playing video games, reading aloud, dancing, and much more!\u00a0 Observers just walked among us.\u00a0 It was unclear whether they were supposed to engage with us or not.\u00a0 One guy did come up to me and ask if he could talk to me.\u00a0 I said, \u201cSure.\u201d\u00a0 He said he thought earlier I had silver lipstick on and now I don\u2019t, so what happened?\u00a0 I said, \u201cOh, that lipstick was so old it didn\u2019t go on right.\u00a0 It was all clumpy.\u00a0 So during one of my breaks, I went to the bathroom to take it off.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWas that part of what was supposed to happen?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo!\u201d\u00a0 And we both laughed.\u00a0 He asked more questions about why did you do this, why not this?Afterward I talked to a handful of acquaintances \u2013 it felt good to be social.\u00a0 That guy came back up to me and said, \u201cYou know, when you put on the lipstick, you really had me convinced.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cConvinced of what?\u00a0 That it looked bad?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo, that you were a woman.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cOh, whoa, OK, so, I\u2019m a little bit of both.\u00a0 As is all this stuff.\u201d\u00a0 I gestured to all my clothes and junk, still strewn about.\u00a0 My two friends I was talking to backed me up, which felt awesome.I think ultimately, I was going for that response, for people to be confused about what genders I was playing out or not playing out.\u00a0 So even though his forwardness made me uncomfortable in the moment, it was an important element, or \u201ctakeaway,\u201d from the night.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "janitorqueer"}
