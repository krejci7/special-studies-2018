(how costumes fit into our lives)I just listened to a really interesting podcast about how what you wear can affect how you feel, how you\u2019re treated, what you decide to do, your cognitive abilities, your identity, and so much more! \u00a0It starts with a brief snippet of a Halloween night, with kids running around a neighborhood in all kinds of costumes. \u00a0Here\u2019s part of that transcript, talking with a girl who is afraid of flying:FRANNY: I\u2019m wearing a leather jacket and an aviator hat and aviator goggles and jeans, boots and an aviator scarf. ROSIN: Franny\u2019s dressed as\u2026 FRANNY: Amelia Earhart. MILLER: Yep, a woman who ate airplanes for breakfast.\u00a0 Who was\u2026 FRANNY: Awesome and brave. ROSIN: And as Franny puts on the white silk scarf, the leather jacket, the hat with the floppy ears\u2026 \u00a0\u2026Guess what happens? \u00a0The nervous disappears. \u00a0If I put you in an airplane right now, what would happen? FRANNY: I\u2019d feel like a pro.It\u2019s true, to an extent! \u00a0We\u2019ve all experienced this, somehow or another, I think.Listen to the full podcast here: \u00a0InvisibiliaFor me, shoes have always been a big deal \u2013 probably my favorite element\u00a0of self expression. \u00a0I remember the first time I got to get a pair of boy\u2019s shoes, in 3rd grade, and the emotional tenor of that moment and of every single day that I got to wear them. \u00a0It was the best thing ever. \u00a0And of years later, in my early 20s, when I first got a pair of skateboarding sneakers \u2013 it was that same feeling (or, OK, maybe a diluted young-adult version of that same feeling) because I decided that I was worthy of wearing the type of shoes I always coveted. \u00a0And I was an adult. \u00a0And I could buy and wear whatever I wanted (I had a hard time \u201cletting\u201d myself buy things that I wanted.) \u00a0And now! \u00a0I recently got a pair of Reebok pump basketball shoes, and\u00a0I have such a fun time just putting them on! \u00a0I\u2019m not a skater or a b-ball player, but that\u2019s OK, shoes say so much more than \u201cbasketball,\u201d \u201crunning,\u201d \u201cwork-boot,\u201d etc.What are your favorite articles of clothing to play around with? Have you used Halloween as an opportunity to try out something new, that you might want to incorporate into everyday life?There are 6 other stories in the podcast, including someone who uses sunglasses to avoid getting bullied, and then ends up feeling so strongly about their magical powers that he just ends up never taking them off. \u00a0This was my favorite story, and it\u2019s the first one, so if you wanna just hear that one, it\u2019s totally worth it!Parts 2 and 3 are also really good. \u00a0Part 2 is about a person who started out as a cross-dresser, and then after a breakup, they started wearing feminine clothing all of the time, and identifying as a trans-woman. \u00a0She was also a fairly public figure, doing stand-up comedy regularly and being covered in the media. \u00a0She was also 6\u20195\u2033, never passed, and always was on guard, feeling paranoid and defensive. \u00a0It was wearing her down, and the feminine clothing had lost their allure. \u00a0After about 7 months, she went back, from \u201cSarah,\u201d to \u201cWill.\u201d \u00a0And he endured backlash from the trans-community for doing so.Part 3 was about a social science experiment (I think I\u2019d read about it in a book, as well), where people were asked to put on a white lab/doctor\u2019s coat, and then go through a battery of concentration tests. \u00a0The control group wore their regular clothes. \u00a0And it was proven that those with the coat on did twice as well as those without! \u00a0Was it something about the extra weight on the shoulders? \u00a0No, that was tested for with just pressure being applied. \u00a0What about if the coat was referred to as a \u201cpainter\u2019s coat\u201d instead of a \u201cdoctor\u2019s coat?\u201d \u00a0No go \u2013 that did not produce any improvements. \u00a0It appears that when people feel like they are putting on something that has a particular meaning, they will, largely subconsciously, act accordingly.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
