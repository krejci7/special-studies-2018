His project:\u00a0 He is the mastermind behind a new radio station that will be hitting the airwaves by October.\u00a0 It\u2019ll be run by and for the community; all funds will be raised by community efforts (as opposed to commercial, although there might be underwriters and/or sponsorship members).So when he approached me, he said that each group presents 20 slides and a representative talks along with the images, which are on an auto-timer of 20 seconds each, for a total 6minute, 40 second presentation (per group).\u00a0 And the audience sits and watches each presentation, one after the other.\u00a0 He told me he\u2019d already gotten permission to stray from the rules and just not use power-point or slides at all.\u00a0 To instead go totally lo-fi, using poster-board with words sharpied in black.\u00a0 Just my style!In the past, any opportunity to be in drag and perform outside of a typical drag show format has been a total blast, and so I jumped on the chance.\u00a0 My friend and I hung out in his attic the Sunday before the event, listening to music, practicing, and drawing out the words with sharpie markers.\u00a0 He had written out a script, telling the story of the radio station thus far.\u00a0 I assumed a wide stance and stony expression, just like Mr. Bob Dylan.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We decided in advance that I was going to have an attitude.\u00a0 I was just going to drop each poster onto the floor and then at the end of our 6:40, I would throw the last poster up into the air and walk off, leaving others to pick them all up.We arrived early, and I was excited to find out we were on first.\u00a0 Love getting a performance out of the way and then kicking back!\u00a0 The audience was a bunch of young entrepreneurs / hipsters / yuppies / intellectuals.\u00a0 Haha.\u00a0 We got up there, did our thing, I walked off, and then we watched everyone else.\u00a0 There was an intermission with cucumber sandwiches, meats and cheeses, and tiny fingerling potatoes(?), and beer.\u00a0 This was, ultimately, a networking event, but I dislike that stuff, so I let my friend do the talking, and my partner and I grabbed food and beer and went to explore the building a little bit.After the event, my partner and I went out to a bar to see a different friend\u2019s new band.\u00a0 I felt really solid in my button-up shirt, vest, and sideburns.\u00a0 I should remember to go out \u201cin drag,\u201d just for fun, more often!Also, if you wanna check out what I wrote in Part 1, it is here!\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 19 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
