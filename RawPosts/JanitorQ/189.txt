Some blogs I\u2019ve really been enjoying lately:Apparently I Don\u2019t ExistmilomorphosisAmorphous AmphibianFISTFELTThe Voice in the ClosetBecause I\u2019m FabulousTransdoctorSir FallsalotTwo Lady GeeksAnd a favorite blog, that, sadly, appears to now be an archive: rainbowgenderpunkIf I linked to your blog, and you wanna follow all the rules, click here for more info about the Liebster Award.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t wanna do it at all, that\u2019s OK too.Some random facts about me:\u2013 I know all of Tom Petty\u2019s greatest hits by heart.\u00a0 This is not indicative of my musical tastes.\u00a0 I just had the cassette tape growing up.\u00a0 (I do still love it.) \u2013 What\u2019s on my iPod right now:\u00a0 albums by Bauhaus, Daft Punk, DJ Shadow, Maps, RJD2, Skinny Puppy, Sleigh Bells, The Roots, Wolf Parade.\u00a0 This is slightly more indicative of my musical tastes.\u00a0 I listen to my iPod every single work-day, for probably 4-6 hours. \u2013 I\u2019m going to hear back in a couple of weeks whether my proposal for a radio show will be accepted.\u00a0 I\u2019ll most likely be a radio DJ starting this fall! \u2013 One of my favorite pastimes is brewing kombucha. It is a delicious, healthy alternative to soda.\u00a0 It is awesome!\u00a0 You can buy it in stores, but it is $$$.\u00a0 You can make it at home for super super cheap. It\u2019s basically just black tea (or any tea, but black is best) and processed, white sugar.\u00a0 Plus the weird flesh-colored disk called a Symbiotic Colony Of Bacteria and Yeast (SCOBY).\u00a0 You have to acquire one of those. \u2013 We have a pet dwarf rabbit named Grey Bunny.\u00a0 She is 12 years old!\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s about all I got for right now.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 19 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
