It helped that her mom (my friend), let us know she often does this.\u00a0 She\u2019s super outgoing, and she\u2019ll hone in on one adult of a group she\u2019s with, and that person is 9 times out of 10 the most handsome adult male of the group.\u00a0 I\u2019ll take it!I have been considering what might happen if I increased my testosterone levels.\u00a0 And these exchanges really sunk in, as one more thing, in a way that makes me feel motivated to move in that direction where I appear and sound more masculine.\u00a0 I am still positive that I do not want to live my life as a visible male, but how cool would it be if people had some serious trouble knowing?\u00a0 I would love that (as long as they were respectful in the not-knowing).This kid\u2019s reaction was interesting, because usually it\u2019s kids more than anyone else, who are not quite sure whether I am a girl or a boy.\u00a0 If I am asked this question, it\u2019s coming from a child.\u00a0 I\u2019m usually not told, strongly and forcefully, by someone making eye contact, two inches away from my face!\u00a0 Haha.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
