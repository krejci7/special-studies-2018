I\u2019ll let you know which ends up being more painful \u2013 this or surgery!Other than that, I feel relatively prepared.\u00a0 I just had my pre-op appointment via phone call a week ago, and that has put things into motion for getting everything ready.\u00a0 I got a huge packet in the mail of things to sign (informed consent), directions for when to do what, etc.\u00a0 I made a checklist to make it easier.Pay surgeon \u2013 I still have to do this.\u00a0 I exhausted all info about my insurance plan, and there is no way insurance would pay for any of it.\u00a0 I expected as much all along, so, no big blow there\u2026Get parking permit \u2013 In process.\u00a0 My spouse and I will be in Ardmore, PA for close to 48 hours, and we need a temporary parking permit to park in the municipal lots.Get therapist letter \u2013 In process.\u00a0 My therapist just sent me her draft last night, and it looked good to me, so she should be faxing it at some point today.Get prescriptions filled \u2013 Done.\u00a0 This could be done well in advance, so your meds are ready for you when you need them.\u00a0 I needed to get a pain med and an antibiotic.Get lab work \u2013 Done.\u00a0 I did it yesterday\u00a0 morning.Go through a pre-op appt. with primary care physician \u2013 Done.\u00a0 I did it yesterday morning.\u00a0 I killed 2 birds with one stone \u2013 this plus shingles diagnosis all in one.\u00a0 She will be filling out a form to clear me, despite the shingles, and faxing it in.Send in consent forms and everything else that needs a signature by me \u2013 I gotta get this together.\u00a0 I think I need to re-print certain pages and figure out what I still need to read through.Take photos of chest \u2013 I did this for the surgeon already, but I might want to re-do it.\u00a0 Not while I have these shingles though!I feel ready for surgery, mentally.\u00a0 Emotionally, I\u2019m wondering if something is going on (shingles are brought on by stress, which I\u2019m not actually feeling).\u00a0 I set up an appointment to see my therapist (who I haven\u2019t been seeing lately), just to cover all my bases.\u00a0 It can\u2019t hurt!\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
