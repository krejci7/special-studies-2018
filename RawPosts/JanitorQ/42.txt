[last name] (pronounced Mixter). \u00a0I\u2019m comfortable answering any questions about this.also a recommendation if you one day have a transgender student: A podcast called \u201cHow to be a Girl,\u201d told from the point-of-view of a parent \u2013 with lots of input from her 8-year-old daughter (male to female). \u00a0They talk about school, friends, privacy, etc. \u00a0The parent is a great advocate.Thank you! -KameronThere was some slight confusion in which the principal included all this information in the school-wide email, where, for example, I had only intended the podcast\u00a0recommendation to be for her. \u00a0But, I realized, the fact everyone received all of the above was actually way better! \u00a0It gave people more context, which, I really really really think helped the information lodge into their brains better. \u00a0Like, I have not had to correct anyone, once! \u00a0Which is just completely blowing my mind. \u00a0People seem more into addressing me by my name than before. \u00a0Some people have decided to call me \u201cKam,\u201d instead, of their own volition, which I\u2019m OK with \u2013 it\u2019s just plain fascinating. \u00a0(My one co-worker / ally has been calling me, \u201cKilla Kam\u201d for a while now. \u00a0Haha.)A barrier between me and other people has definitely started to lift, just within this past month. \u00a0I have had more conversations with more people about a wider variety of things than ever before. \u00a0This is what being a person within a work environment is mostly\u00a0about. \u00a0The connections are what make it something more than just a random assortment of people that you (seemingly) have nothing in common with.I wanna just keep running with this!PS: \u00a0This post has 882 words. \u00a0Haha. PPS: \u00a0Posts coming soon about this amazing podcast, \u201cHow to be a Girl.\u201d\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
