(Mixter) in their professional settings. \u00a0I had heard of this before, but I thought it was just a theoretical pipe dream. \u00a0Here was someone who was actually using it, in their actual life! \u00a0I felt soooo jealous. \u00a0I thought to myself (with\u00a0a good dose of biting envy), \u201cOooh, look at the progressive academic who gets to waltz around in an enlightened and indulgent bubble all day long.\u201d \u00a0I never thought I would get there. \u00a0Furthermore, even though I\u2019m in my thirties, it was tough to envision a world where I was grown-up enough to have an honorific of my own.I\u2019d done an excellent job at avoiding it. \u00a0No Mr. or Ms. for me! \u00a0I am a janitor at an\u00a0elementary school: \u00a0a place where there\u2019s a lot of \u201cMr. / Mrs. / Miss / Ms.\u00a0[last name]\u201d around the kids, and then first names\u00a0amongst ourselves. \u00a0Except for the custodial staff. \u00a0It\u2019s first names all around for us, generally. \u00a0Everywhere except for our name plates on the custodial office door. \u00a0There, we are \u201cMr.\u00a0[last name]\u201d and \u201cMrs. [last name]\u201d \u00a0I had somehow gotten away with requesting that I be simply \u201cKD Shorts.\u201d \u00a0It was awesome.There was another\u00a0sticking point though: \u00a0every year, at school pictures time. \u00a0We get our pics taken, \u00a0and then we get some freebies, as well as a sheet of all the staff pics \u2013 just like a student would get a sheet of their class. \u00a0And so, we had to give our names, to be recorded on the sheet. \u00a0It would vary from year to year, depending on how vocal/empowered I was feeling. \u00a0I usually told the portrait employee, \u201cno Ms. or Mr. \u00a0Just KD Shorts.\u201d \u00a0There were a few years though, where I was\u00a0\u201cMs. Shorts\u201d as the default.These past few weeks, I\u2019ve been riding the wave of legally changing my name, which has been especially gratifying at work, where I was still known as KD Shorts, (she/her/hers). \u00a0Everywhere else in my life, I had been going by \u201cKameron\u201d for about two years, and (he/him/his) for many many years prior to that. \u00a0So, essentially, I utilized this time of change as a chance to come out at work.I talked to the principal and assistant principal on Friday, December 23rd. \u00a0I stated that I was changing my name and my pronouns, and that I identify as neither a man nor a woman. \u00a0The impromptu meeting was less than stellar \u2013 they fixated on bathrooms and the fact that the change was going to be hard for people to remember. \u00a0They did mention that they wanted me to feel comfortable, but didn\u2019t offer any concrete ways that that could happen. \u00a0I did not panic though \u2013 I was thinking, \u201cdo not catastrophize this.\u201d \u00a0I remained neutral and open, but I didn\u2019t use it as a teaching moment. \u00a0I shouldn\u2019t have to! \u00a0I thought\u00a0that things would work out fine, ultimately, and if not, I could always call in the big guns: \u00a0my local gay alliance\u2019s speaker\u2019s bureau, to do the\u00a0educating on my behalf.We all took a time out for winter recess. \u00a0I then came in on Tuesday, January 3rd, and the principal asked me if I\u2019d come speak to her. \u00a0Of her own volition, she had consulted the head of HR, and she had basically done a 180. \u00a0We had a much more fruitful discussion. \u00a0She still was strong in her opinions, but she made it clear that every choice was up to me, and I could take some time to think it over. \u00a0We ended up talking about: \u2013 How to come out, and the timeline \u2013 How my name would appear on my name plate on the custodial office door \u2013 BathroomsComing out: \u00a0I said that I have already pretty much told the people I would naturally tell in person, the ones I see regularly or semi-regularly. \u00a0And I wasn\u2019t going to be able to get to everyone, so if she could either make an announcement at the next staff meeting and/or send an email, that\u2019d be great. \u00a0We agreed she would do both. \u00a0I told her I\u2019d get back to her with the content I\u2019d like her to say.Name plate: \u00a0The biggie! \u00a0I said I had two ideas, but I didn\u2019t say exactly what they were. \u00a0(I\u2019ll say it here though! \u00a0Either\u00a0 1. just \u201cKameron\u201d\u00a0and nothing else. \u00a02. Mx. [last name].) \u00a0She said that her thought was that my co-workers have Mr. _____ and Mrs. _____, so it\u2019d be great if I conformed to that and picked one or the other. \u00a0I said, \u201cOK! \u00a0Great, there is another option that I will go with. \u00a0It\u2019s Mx. \u00a0That\u2019s pronounced \u2018Mixter.'\u201d \u00a0She wrote it down in her notes. \u00a0It was a done deal!Bathrooms: \u00a0I could write an additional article about this (heck, probably more like a dissertation!), but to keep it short and sweet: \u00a0We agreed that I get to pick where I go, and I am making no big deal of it, and it does not need to be a part of any announcement.All\u2019s how it should be! \u00a0Just one more small way I am joining the world of adults. \u00a0That\u2019s Mixter, to you.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
