testosterone.\u00a0 During this past year of seeing him multiple times (in the beginning, it was so many times), our values and expectations were not at all lining up.\u00a0 My goals and values include communication, follow-through, trust, and respect.\u00a0 As far as I could gather, his values involved maximizing appointment frequency ($$$$$), minimizing face-time, being the expert, and using aggression to barrel through mistakes.Because of all these clashes, I got myself a new doctor for a couple of months from now.\u00a0 Plus, I have a plan B if that doesn\u2019t pan out.\u00a0 I feel a huge amount of relief to never have to see my previous doctor again!\u00a0 Here is an anecdote from that last visit:I called on a Friday to ask if I could come in and pick up a prescription the following week.\u00a0 (Because testosterone is a controlled substance, I can never get refills or prescriptions faxed to pharmacies, apparently?\u00a0 So even though I only need to see the doctor / get blood work every 6 months, I have to go every 3 months just to get a new script.)\u00a0 The receptionist asked when I\u2019d want to make the appointment, and I had to repeatedly be clear this is not an appt.\u00a0 I am not due for an appointment at this time.\u00a0 I told her I\u2019d like to come in Thursday to just pick up a prescription.\u00a0 I asked, \u201cShould I call ahead that morning to make sure?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYes, that would be good.\u201dI called Thursday morning to ask if the script was ready.\u00a0 She replied that oh, no it\u2019s still in his messages box.\u00a0 She told me he\u2019d do it once I arrived at the office.\u00a0 I said OK.\u00a0 Once I got there, I waited a while to speak with the receptionist.\u00a0 She and a patient were in the middle of an argument about outstanding bills.The woman asked how had she been able to see the doctor without paying?\u00a0 There has never been a time he has seen her unless she pays first.\u00a0 This is why she\u2019s not able to see him right now \u2013 she hasn\u2019t paid first.\u00a0 So how could she have a debt if he won\u2019t ever see her before she pays?\u00a0 She asked the receptionist to ask him, since she can\u2019t go ask because he won\u2019t talk to her unless she\u2019s paid, at any point in time.\u00a0 She can never talk to him.\u00a0 There was a question about the dates of these alleged appointments, and the receptionist just kept replying that she does not know anything because she\u2019s not the billing department.\u00a0 This circular back-and-forth was making me feel dizzy (I was rooting for her in this standoff, anyway).\u00a0 There were other nonsensical details, but I can\u2019t recall everything.\u00a0 I was focused on myself and getting out as quickly as possible.The woman stepped aside to call the billing department, so I approached the receptionist just to be like, \u201cHey, remember me?\u00a0 I\u2019m here now.\u201d\u00a0 Haha.\u00a0 I sat back down and waited for a while.\u00a0 The doctor brushed past the entrance to the waiting room and mumbled my name (maybe?) and for me to step into room 4.\u00a0 My heart started racing.\u00a0 I knew I was about to be bullied into an appointment, and I was prepping to fight back.I stood up and tentatively walked toward the corridor (because I wasn\u2019t even sure he had been addressing me!)\u00a0 He came back through and directed me to a room.\u00a0 I said, \u201cOK, just to be clear, this is not an appointment.\u00a0 I am just here for the prescription.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI know, but we have to get you a new blood work form, so it is [an appointment.]\u201d\u00a0 He essentially yelled this as he rushed down the hall to his office.\u00a0 I stood in the room to wait for him, but did not sit down or take off my coat.\u00a0 Once he came in, I asserted, \u201cI had my blood work done in December.\u00a0 So it is not due, and I do not need an appointment at this time.\u201d He replied, \u201cOh, it was December?\u00a0 I thought it was June.\u00a0 OK then, you\u2019re right.\u00a0 Well, take this form anyway since I already filled it out.\u00a0 What prescription do you need?\u201d \u201cAndrogel.\u201d \u201cThe Androgel rep is here right now.\u00a0 Go ahead and go back to the waiting room and tell him how much you like it.\u201d \u201cOK.\u201d\u00a0 ???I went back out to wait for him to get me my prescription.\u00a0 A young man in a suit and black wool pea coat, with a briefcase, sat kiddie-corner to me.\u00a0 I thought to myself, Oh, what the hell?\u00a0 I like his product 100X more than I\u2019ve liked anything else I\u2019ve ever been prescribed.\u00a0 I guess I\u2019ll tell him\u2026 \u201cHey, I like your product,\u201d I said, nodding my chin his way. \u201cOh, you like it?\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 It\u2019s a good product.\u201d I sat there feeling smug and tough, for some reason.\u00a0 I guess because everything was feeling increasingly surreal, and instead of shutting-down to it, I participated in the absurdity.The doctor finally came out and gave me my prescription.\u00a0 He said, \u201cDid you tell him how much you like it?\u201d \u201cI did.\u201dAnd then I finally got to walk out the door.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 21 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
