but he was a janitor.\u00a0 And when I started doing drag, one of my earliest ideas was to portray him as a janitor, singing / screaming into a dust-mop handle like it\u2019s a microphone.\u00a0 (And also using the handle as a pole vault to propel myself off of the stage, super dramatic-like.)I went back to his journals in order to glean some details from his janitorial career.\u00a0 He dropped out of high school 2 weeks before graduation, turned right back around, and worked as a janitor at his old school.\u00a0 He also later worked at Polynesian Condominium Hotel Resort, and for Lemons Janitorial.On page 43 of his journals, he drew up a mock flyer for a janitorial business he apparently was dreaming up with Chris Novoselic (bass player) called Pine Tree Janitorial Service:\u00a0 Basic Commercial Maintenance.\u00a0 He claims, \u201cWe purposely limit our number of commercial offices in order to personally clean while taking our time.\u00a0 We guarantee $50.00 lower rates than your present janitorial service.\u00a0 You see, other services usually have too many buildings assigned to the individual\u2019s route.\u00a0 So in turn they end up running thru buildings trying for time.\u00a0 But at Pine Tree \u2014\u2014\u201d\u00a0 The page ends there and so does the thought process.\u00a0 His band was really starting to take off anyway by then, haha.\u00a0 Most of the journals are devoted to band-related thoughts (and thoughts about drugs, guilt, politics, fame, etc.), not janitorial dreams.On page 160, he\u2019s starting to plan out the music video for \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit.\u201d\u00a0 He wrote out a list: \u201cneeded 1.\u00a0 mercedes benz and a few old cars 2.\u00a0 access to an abandoned mall, main floor and one jewelry shop. 3.\u00a0 lots of fake jewelry 4.\u00a0 School Auditorium (Gym) 5.\u00a0 A cast of hundreds.\u00a0 1 custodian, students. 6.\u00a0 6 black cheerleader outfits with Anarchy A\u2019s on chest\u201dNot sure what became of the old cars (gold mercedes benz?), mall scene, and fake jewelry, but the gymnasium scene, cheerleaders, and custodian ideas did come to fruition.The cheerleaders are wearing black uniforms with anarchy symbols on them.\u00a0 The custodian plays a much more prominent role in the video than he would at an actual school.\u00a0 He is rocking out with his mop handle \u2013 in multiple cut-away shots.\u00a0 Great music video moments!Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have any pictures of my performances doing Nirvana songs, as a janitor.\u00a0 But I remember some details!\u00a0 The two songs I did (at two separate times) were \u201cAneurysm\u201d and \u201cSliver.\u201d\u00a0 My hair, at the time was bleached blonde, and I pulled it in front of my face in stringy clumps.\u00a0 I wore work boots, navy blue Dickies pants with a lot of keys hanging off the belt loop, a light blue work shirt \u2013 not tucked in- with epaulets, and a thermal shirt underneath that.\u00a0 I brought a dust mop to dust mop the stage / use as microphone stand and pole vault.\u00a0 Once off the stage, I continued dust mopping all throughout the audience.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know whether anyone got into these performances or knew what I was doing, but it felt pretty cathartic.Just like Kurt Cobain, I worked at my old high school \u2013 er, technically it was my middle school, but it is now a high school (although unlike Kurt, I managed to graduate first, and to also graduate from college before returning).\u00a0 It was weird.\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019ll write about it more in depth at a later date.\u00a0 I also have rocked out with mops many many times, just like the janitor in the video (often, I\u2019d be narrowing down drag songs, listening to my mp3 player and lip synching into the mirror in the bathrooms).\u00a0 I\u2019m actually currently doing this while at work!\u00a0 I have a Halloween drag show coming up and I\u2019m trying to decide between Bauhaus, Skinny Puppy, Swans, and a few others.I\u2019d like to think that Kurt Cobain wrote some of what\u2019s in his journals while he was working as a janitor.\u00a0 Although I don\u2019t write in a journal, I do have a little notebook on my cart where I write out lists and jot down thoughts about music, mostly.\u00a0 I also often utilize the time to think about stuff I might write about here, on this blog.If you\u2019re interested in what else I\u2019ve written for these series so far, here they are:Janitors in pop culture #1 \u2013 Good Will Hunting Drag King Stories #1 \u2013 Starting Out / Overview Drag King
