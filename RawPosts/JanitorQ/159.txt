nice to get out of town.\u00a0 The art museum portion of the day was totally bizarre and surreal.\u00a0 The docent seemed surprised we wanted to pay the full $5 each suggested donation.\u00a0 No one else was in the museum except for her and a very friendly (and bored?) security guard.\u00a0 Or so we thought, until we headed toward the stairway to the bottom floor \u2013 there were loud banging noises and the sounds of screaming children en masse.\u00a0 I just kept visualizing a stampede of school-aged children horsing around and slamming into the glass cases housing invaluable ceramics.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t too far off \u2013 it was indeed a stampede of children, but they were contained within a \u201cplay area.\u201dpriceless ceramic piece #1priceless ceramic piece #2We wandered around for a solid 2 hours, and were trailed by the guard for much of that time.\u00a0 She made sure to let us know we could take photos of the ceramics, as long as we didn\u2019t use flash.\u00a0 She pointed out some specific ones to us, commenting, \u201cthis one fools a lot of people,\u201d etc.\u00a0 She asked us if we\u2019ve ever heard a player piano before (part of one of the exhibits) and we felt obligated to follow her back into a room we\u2019d already been in, because the piano was rolling out the music.\u00a0 I asked her how many times the piano kicks on per day.\u00a0 She said, \u201cthree or four.\u201d\u00a0 There was an A/V exhibit where you could record a 10 second digital video of yourself, while manipulating special effects.\u00a0 So, we went ahead and did that, and playback mode shows what you just recorded, followed by everyone else\u2019s segments\u2026\u00a0 Our block was followed by 10 seconds of the guard, pacing the room at a slight distance, all pixelated and swooping (she must have recorded herself earlier in the day).\u00a0 It was a distorted version of our real life experience, at the art museum.\u00a0 It was a moment.The gallery event was incredible.\u00a0 Very well attended.\u00a0 Lots of snacks and drinks (I usually make a bee-line for the free snacks at these kinds of things).\u00a0 Seeing these images (many of which I\u2019ve seen online) on these white walls, in person, felt really powerful.\u00a0 There\u2019s an Episcopal nun.\u00a0 A fire fighter.\u00a0 An ex-military person.\u00a0 A cat rescuer.\u00a0 A MMA fighter.\u00a0 A DJ.\u00a0 And so many more.\u00a0 I think Rhys\u2019s project is going to go far.\u00a0 He\u2019s already going far!\u00a0 He recognized me right away, and we talked further about my being photographed in the future.\u00a0 We also talked about being introverts and stuff like that.\u00a0 He invited us to an after-party outing which was super nice, but we politely declined (since my partner and I are such introverts.\u00a0 Haha.)me and Rhys!The opening was a joint effort with Gavin Rouille, a conceptual and graphic artist living in Minneapolis. gavinlaurencerouille.wordpress.com.\u00a0 If you go to his website and click on \u201cpersonal\u201d (personal work), you\u2019ll come upon a lot of really cool visual stuff.lots of interactive and take-away materials!\u00a0 (apologies for the blurriness \u2013 this stuff is all on his website as well.)The text on the card reads:\u00a0 \u201cDear friend, I am a boy.\u00a0 I am sure you did not realize this when you called me, \u2018lady, girl, miss, she, her, or ma\u2019am.\u2019\u00a0 In the past I have attempted to alert people of my gender identity in advance.\u00a0 Unfortunately, this causes them to react to me as pushy, or socially inappropriate.\u00a0 Therefore, my policy is to assume people don\u2019t make these assumptions about me, and to distribute this card when they do.\u00a0 I regret any discomfort my presence is causing you just as I am sure you regret the discomfort your assumptions are causing me.\u201dEdit:\u00a0 I JUST saw this: this article about Rhys\u2019s photos was published 2 hours ago in Cosmo.\u00a0 (!!!)
