THE CARS \u2013 MOVING IN STEREO!!! \u00a0In my book, it doesn\u2019t get any more classic / fabulous than that.I was really just browsing, not looking for anything in particular. \u00a0A bunch of stuff popped out to me as \u201cmust have\u2019s.\u201d \u00a0I got a handful of 7-inches, and a couple of records.I\u2019d recently started thinking I need to upgrade a few records, if I come across copies in better condition, because I am a DJ (That\u2019s a Bowie song!), and it sucks to play crappy sounding vinyl.Five days prior, I\u2019d told a friend that I probably need a new copy of Culture Club\u2019s \u201cColour by Numbers.\u201d \u00a0Me \u2018n this record have a loooooong history together. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t get any more basic than that. \u00a0Sure enough, at this record store, they had two options!!! \u00a0Either: An original, still factory sealed, for $9.99, or An original, still with the plastic plus promo stickers saying \u201cGrammy Nominee,\u201d and \u201cAll New Songs!\u201d (and then it listed 4 song titles. \u00a0This one was $10 even. I went with the one with bonus stickers! (PS \u2013 $10 is pretty much the most I\u2019m willing to spend on a record, and it better be pristine and/or hard to find!) Another exciting find was: PETE SHELLEY* \u2013 HOMOSAPIEN* (Elongated Dancepartydubmix) !!!Anyway, back to the story: \u00a0So I bought this stuff and went back to the music store I had really wanted to check out. \u00a0It was small and quiet (I think he was playing music, but I have no recollection of anything playing!) and there were just a couple of older dudes coming in and out, with special requests and just to shoot the breeze. \u00a0I was only there for about an hour, but I left with a HUGE HAUL. \u00a0I spent more on records and cds than I ever have before (meaning within one store at one time.) \u00a0Almost everything I found was $5 or under, and it was an extreme pick-through type situation. \u00a0Meaning, don\u2019t go looking for anything in particular, just start looking at everything!I had a nice conversation with the owner while he rung things up (in a way so as not to distract him, haha, he was super methodical with his calculator and his mechanical receipt machine.) \u00a0I told him he\u2019s got lots of great obscure stuff, and I might be back within 6 months or a year or whatever. \u00a0He asked me if I live here or am passing through. \u00a0I said I went to his old store with my mom a lot and he then seemed to maybe remember me. \u00a0I said I do live here, I\u2019m a DJ, I like 80\u2019s music, etc. \u00a0It took him a long time to ring everything individually, so I started browsing to pass more time. \u00a0Found 3 more cds to buy, and then, as a last minute thing, the \u201cDAVID BOWIE\u201d category within the records popped out. \u00a0There were two records in there: DIAMOND DOGS* (pristine and currently hard to find) for $15.98 and LET\u2019S DANCE* (pristine and currently hard to find) for $9.98I bought Diamond Dogs because that more or less completes my Bowie On Vinyl collection (no new pressings or record store day garbage, haha.) \u00a0I left Let\u2019s Dance behind because I already have it, but, hey everybody,LET\u2019S DANCE, everybody, DIAMOND DOGS and BENNY AND THE JETS included! \u00a0We\u2019re all HOMOSAPIENS, we\u2019re all JEEPSTERs, MOVING IN STEREO, sex and drugs and rock \u2018n roll\u2026_________________________________________________*All Capital LettersNOTES:This is, by far, the longest post I\u2019ve ever written.\u00a0 Does the song \u201cBye Bye Love\u201d by The Cars have 3 F-Bombs in it? \u00a0Also, are they saying, \u201cIt\u2019s OMG Style.\u201d???Pete Shelley was the lead singer of original English punk-rockers, The Buzzcocks.Another exciting find was TWO copies (one for me, one for my friend) of a pink marbled vinyl original 7\u2033 EP by The Stranglers from 1977, one of our fave bands! \u00a0They were $4.00 each. \u00a0(Hugs Work!)I\u2019m listening to The Cars S/T debut while I write this.If you haven\u2019t yet, check out the music video for \u201cHello Again.\u201d \u00a0It\u2019s prob on youtube or some shit.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
