What are 2-3 questions (or as many as you like) that one should NOT be asking a transgender person? What are 2-3 questions (or as many as you like) that one SHOULD be asking a transgender person?This reader happens to be the marketing coordinator of Simmons College, the third US women\u2019s college to accept students who identify as transgender.\u00a0 She was wondering if I\u2019d like to add to the conversation in the form of a blog post.\u00a0 Sure!\u00a0 So, officially:I am participating in Trans*forming the Dialogue, Simmons College\u2019s online MSW program\u2018s campaign to promote an educational conversation about the transgender community.\u00a0 By participating in this campaign, I will be offering my perspective on what TO ask and what to NOT ask trans*people.The first thing to think about:\u00a0 it totally depends on how well you know the person!\u00a0 So, let\u2019s break it down:If this is someone who is a stranger, and they just introduced themselves to you, saying their name back to them is a great way to start out affirming who they are.\u00a0 Also asking, \u201cWhat are your preferred pronouns,\u201d is important so that you can address them to other people in the way they want/need.\u00a0 This is a little tricky because we\u2019re specifically talking about visibly trans-people here.\u00a0 You could be meeting many trans-people throughout your life and not even know it!Then, personally, I would steer the conversation away from trans-related topics, unless they bring it up.\u00a0 Oftentimes, trans-people don\u2019t want to talk about more personal aspects upon meeting someone new.\u00a0 So any other great questions fall into the general getting-to-know-you category.\u00a0 \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d\u00a0 Or, \u201cHow do you know so-and-so?\u201d\u00a0 Or, \u201cHow\u2019s your day been so far?\u201dIf you are talking to an acquaintance and want to get to know them better, instead of asking direct questions about their experience, you could share some of your own \u2013 what was your childhood like, what was puberty like?\u00a0 Chances are your new acquaintance has a lot to say about growing up and will feel more comfortable sharing if you share first.\u00a0 Do NOT ask, \u201cdo you feel like you are trapped in the wrong body?\u201d\u00a0 This is a trope perpetuated by the media that not all trans-people relate to.\u00a0 It\u2019s kind of a sensationalized way of putting it.\u00a0 It is a sound bite.\u00a0 Asking about their experience is a great way to get a better understanding about how broad and different \u201ctrans-narratives\u201d really are.If you are a friend / ally of a trans-person, there is a lot you can do and ask!\u00a0 You can specifically ask, \u201cWhat can I do to support you?\u201d\u00a0 It might mean correcting pronouns in the moment in social situations for your trans-friend.\u00a0 (I know I have a hard time with this, and if someone does it for me, it feels affirming.)\u00a0 It might mean exploring gender expressions together \u2013 maybe going out and trying on different clothes or trying out makeup together.\u00a0 If you are a trusted friend, more personal questions to help you understand would probably be appropriate.\u00a0 \u201cWhat does gender dysphoria feel like?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHow would you define your gender?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhere are you in your coming-out process?\u201d\u00a0 These questions can spark great conversations that let your trans-friend know you are engaged and interested and want to help if possible.If you are in an intimate relationship with a trans-person, asking a lot of questions is essential!\u00a0 Transition related decisions will affect both of you, emotionally, financially, and energy-wise.\u00a0 It\u2019s important not to press for a timeline or throw in your two cents about what your partner should be doing.\u00a0 You will need to adjust to the natural pace (it is a long process) and understand that there is going to be a lot of uncertainty.\u00a0 \u201cWhat can I do to support you?\u201d works well, but your partner might not really know in the moment.\u00a0 There will probably be times when gender dysphoria and frustrations are acute \u2013 during those times, just being physically present and not asking any questions might be best.\u00a0 In the bedroom, asking what is OK is a must.\u00a0 The way trans-people feel about their bodies and about sex can be wildly in flux and change from day to day.\u00a0 Asking, \u201cIs this OK?\u201d or \u201cwhat if I did this?\u201d or \u201cWhat feels good right now?\u201d is going to be better than phrasing things in the negative, such as, \u201cWhat is off limits right now?\u201d or \u201cWhere can I touch you?\u201d\u00a0 These kinds of questions might lead to shut-down mode.Questions that are never appropriate are, \u201cHave you had any surgeries yet?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhat are you going to do about your beard?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cDo you think you will be able to pass?\u201d\u00a0 Or anything else related to their bodies and their appearance.\u00a0 This is personal and could be triggering.\u00a0 Not all trans-people have the same goals or timeline.\u00a0 Also, some people are non-binary, and their transition goals might look very different.If you don\u2019t know the trans-person very well yet, and you are not sure what is OK and what is not OK to ask, just use this rule of thumb:\u00a0 Is this something you would ask a cisgender person?\u00a0 Other than the preferred pronouns question (important question you might not ask a cisgender person) this will get you far in a social situation.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 13
