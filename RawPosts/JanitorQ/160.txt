I think because we were discussing Stone Butch Blues, and I felt like I was supposed to be adding to the discussion, yet I couldn\u2019t say anything. I\u2019m one of five people in class who are potentially VERY focused on issues raised in that book. These other classmates all contributed a lot. I contributed nothing. I just couldn\u2019t. Katrina even brought attention to me because of the zines I\u2019ve been handing in for my project. She wanted me to talk about some of the stuff.\u201c[Janitorqueer\u2019s] been doing these amazing zines,\u201d she told the class. I felt like I was in elementary school again, simultaneously hoping for and fearing any kind of attention. \u201cCan you share with us your thoughts about what you\u2019ve been writing about, after reading through Stone Butch Blues again?\u201d I hadn\u2019t read through Stone Butch Blues again. I hadn\u2019t yet read ANY of the books for class. I feel guilty and like a fraud. I stared straight ahead. Said, \u201d \u2026 um \u2026 \u201d in almost a whisper. My mind was totally blank. Why does this happen? She acknowledged my discomfort by asking me if we should just move on. I said, \u201cyeah.\u201dI thought I might cry. How awful would that have been. I tuned out completely to avoid that scene, and that worked really well. I came back to reality within a few minutes. But for the rest of class, all I wanted to do was grab all of my stuff and run out of the room \u2026 go and hide. I have this urge often in class, but it\u2019s never been THIS intense. Sometimes I want to slip through the edge of the floor, but not today. I just wanted to explode out, to escape.Girlfriend? was brought up during the discussion! We were talking about clothing and performance, and Katrina asked me, \u201cYou know [your girlfriend?], right?\u201d I nodded. Because I referred to girlfriend? a few times in my zines, she must have made the connection. Then she addressed the class. \u201cGirlfriend? uses clothes as a performance all the time. She is always playing \u2026 she\u2019ll wear goth, hello kitty, Ragedy Ann (girlfriend? prefers to call this one \u201cBag Lady\u201d) \u2026 and when she came into class the day people were instructed to wear particularly masculine or feminine clothing, something different than normal, she said that this isn\u2019t any different for her than any other day because she\u2019s always playing. She feels comfortable dressing extremely masculine and/or feminine.\u201dA classmate asked, \u201cDid she have pink hair for a while last year?\u201d and I nodded, yes. \u201cOh, ok, I had a class with her. She is really interesting.\u201d Katrina: \u201cYeah, she\u2019s very bright.\u201d Classmate: \u201cPolitical Science major?\u201d I nodded again.I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever thought of girlfriend?\u2019s incredible attention to clothing as \u201cplaying.\u201d I thought of it as this valley girl thing she does. This thing which is sometimes tedious and sometimes fun and goofy. (She is really excited about creating me as a goth girl for Halloween.) To look at it as a carefully planned out form of play makes me respect it much more. I feel proud that I \u201cknow\u201d her. I feel especially tender toward her, or something, ah, I don\u2019t know! Anyway \u2026\u201d ________________________________________I remember that Halloween.\u00a0 She dressed me up in her clothing and did my hair and make-up.\u00a0 I liked it.\u00a0 She was dressed as a school-girl gone wrong, or something to that effect.\u00a0 It was a really warm night, and we kind of just walked around a lot, stopping in at this party and that party, maybe acquaintances of hers.\u00a0 (I had no idea.\u00a0 As per usual, I was out of it, dissociating.)It makes me think about all the things we can be expressing with our clothing choices, gender-wise and otherwise.\u00a0 And although Halloween costumes are extremes, all sorts of outfits can be seen as \u201ccostumes.\u201d\u00a0 Getting dressed up in formal wear?\u00a0 Costume.\u00a0 Even business casual?\u00a0 Still, costume.\u00a0 Work out clothes?\u00a0 Total costume.\u00a0 If it\u2019s not a t-shirt, hoodie, button-up shirt (mostly flannel), jeans, corduroys (or gym shorts, sweat pants for lounging around), hiking boots, or skater shoes, to me, it feels like a costume.\u00a0 Which isn\u2019t a bad thing at all!\u00a0 Costumes have their times and places \u2013 I love costumes!\u00a0 But I will not compromise and wear clothing that does not allow me to feel like myself, when that\u2019s all I wanna be.Another blog writer covers some similar concepts, here \u2013 Becoming Hope:\u00a0 MasksOh, and completely coincidentally, this year I\u2019m going as a goth boy for Halloween. What\u2019s your take on costumes?\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 16 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
