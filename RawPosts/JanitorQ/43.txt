My name is Kale and I wrote a guest blog post for Kameron over a year ago when I first started taking testosterone. I live, mostly, in Newfoundland, where it\u2019s cold and grey a lot of the year. I suppose it goes without saying that a lot has changed for me in the past year. I\u2019m writing this today after making a monumental change to my appearance and expression of self this very morning. After five years of having them I decided to cut off my dreadlocks. I know some of you might be thinking \u201cwhat does that have to do with taking testosterone or being transmasculine?\u201d Well, I believe that all the choices we make about our bodies, not just the big ones like taking hormones or having surgery, impact our experience of self enormously. And though I hate to think on my dreads in a negative way I know they were a kind of crutch for me for a long time. If you think about it dreads are very gender neutral. Whether a man or a woman has dreads it doesn\u2019t matter; the dreads will more or less look the same. And certainly once my dreads were long enough they obscured my neck, my slender feminine neck.Well after a year it seems my neck isn\u2019t as slender as it once was. In fact a lot of things about my body are very different. It amazes me how I can feel so much the same and so very different all at the same time. On the one hand the differences feel right to me, feel like the me I always expected to be, and I know that makes a huge difference. On the other hand I know there is so much about me that is the same, the integral parts of me that will never change, no matter what. I think a lot of folks, myself included, fear changes that will alter who they perceive themselves to be. It\u2019s a legitimate fear but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s grounded in any reality. I know that I am the same person I\u2019ve always been except now I feel closer to that person and so much happier. I should say that I identify with being transmasculine but do not feel comfortable with many labels. Every label I\u2019ve ever tried on did not fit well enough to make me feel comfortable with it. Right now I like to say that I do not feel like a man or a woman. I feel like myself and that person has masculine and feminine traits.Generally I feel more attuned to my masculine side and that was a huge factor in my choosing HRT. Being read as female, therefore feminine only, made me feel very unlike myself. I could not live that way feeling like no one saw me for who I was. A year later my voice is pretty low and I have the faintest line of hair over my upper lip. My veins pop out of my forearms and my pecs and shoulders have muscles they never had before. Strangers almost always think I\u2019m a man. This is my new reality. It generally feels good to me but it\u2019s not perfect. I\u2019m not a man. I don\u2019t really want to consistently be thought of as one. I take what I can get though because in this society being seen as neither a man nor a woman is a pretty unrealistic goal. I feel closer to my masculine side so being read as a man is less difficult than being read as a woman.The other huge reason I chose HRT was my association with my genitals and my experiences of sex. For whatever reason I am cursed with the desire to have male genitalia. It fucking sucks. I cannot imagine having bottom surgery despite the fact that I really would rather male genitalia. I\u2019m so not ready to even entertain that idea and I don\u2019t know if that will ever change. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what testosterone would do for my relationship with my genitals but it certainly seemed worth trying. This was hands down the best choice of my life. I can\u2019t express how thankful I am that I had the ability to make this choice. Before HRT I often could not derive sexual pleasure from my junk; it just didn\u2019t feel like it was a part of me. That feeling was exasperating. I felt incredible guilt because I loved my partner but I could not enjoy sex with them. I don\u2019t know how to describe the difference in my genitals other than it feels like what I imagine having male genitalia feels like. I have experienced some clitoral growth but it\u2019s so much more than that. The difference is mind blowing, truly, and I wish I could find the words to express what it actually feels like but I can\u2019t seem to. I hate to use the cliche but it\u2019s so accurate; my body feels like my body now.Despite all the ways I am so thankful for testosterone, I don\u2019t like to put excessive emphasis on HRT. It was right for me in that moment in time. It\u2019s not necessarily the right choice for everyone. And certainly I don\u2019t think HRT is the only thing that\u2019s helped me with my sense of self. If I want to I can think about my dreads negatively, as being a crutch. Or I can think about them positively, as being a big part of how I expressed myself authentically. Having dreadlocks and using HRT are both choices I made to feel closer to the person I feel inside. There\u2019s so many ways that we can learn to be happy in our own bodies and the only thing that matters is that; each individual person\u2019s happiness. I am so happy I found the courage to choose HRT but there are still days I look in the mirror and wonder who I am, what I think I\u2019m doing. They\u2019re less often, definitely, but they\u2019re still there. This life is a journey, happiness is a journey and there\u2019s no end until you\u2019re dead. I wish I could say HRT made me completely whole and happy and yay now my days of feeling dysphoria and sadness are over! But it\u2019s just not true. Happiness is not something you attain once and that\u2019s it; it\u2019s something you have to always work for. My intent in saying all this is to remind folks of certain realities. And I need to remember them as much as anyone. Life is hard. Go easy on yourself. Love yourself, no matter what you may feel sometimes. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve taken out of this last year and all my experiences with my changing body it\u2019s this.____________________________I like how Kale starts this piece with\u00a0hair-related changes, and then gets more into it from there. \u00a0I also use my hairstyle to obscure my slender feminine neck! \u00a0What are some things you do to help feel more congruent with your gender identity?If you\u2019d like to write a guest post, please go for it! \u00a0You can just click on \u201cask me something\u201d at the top of the page\u2026\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
