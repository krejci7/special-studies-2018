\u00a0Did you feel like something was wrong? \u00a0Who were your playmates?\u201d \u00a0I cut her off and said, while smiling, \u201cI find these questions interesting, but I don\u2019t see how they are pertinent to the here-and-now.\u201d \u00a0She replied that, well, for some people\u2026 and trailed off. \u00a0And then we changed directions. \u00a0It was awesome.She told me that the next step is bloodwork, then she will prescribe the T. \u00a0Then I go pick it up and come back and learn how to inject myself, from a nurse practitioner. \u00a0I figured all this could take around a month. \u00a0I got the bloodwork done the next day. \u00a0I got a message that the endo filled the prescription 6 days later. \u00a0I got a call that the pharmacy will have it in stock the next day (today). \u00a0Then I got a call from the endo\u2019s office saying we could schedule an appointment tomorrow at 8am. \u00a0Whoa. \u00a0Whirlwind! \u00a0After all the time and effort it took to make the appointment in the first place, this was so super speedy and efficient.Am I ready? \u00a0I\u2019m not sure! \u00a0Like, I am definitely ready because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve planned on and talked about for a long time now. \u00a0And because it is a big part of my ultimate goal, which is to present in such a way that people really cannot tell whether I am male or female.But to enter that space is super scary. \u00a0I\u2019m generally viewed as female, and it feels safe. \u00a0I use women\u2019s public restrooms, I am legally female, and I am not viewed as threatening / I don\u2019t feel threatened. \u00a0That could change. \u00a0I\u2019m not sure where I will feel most comfortable \u2013 I guess going on T-injections is one of the ways\u00a0of finding that out.This definitely feels different from the time I started Androgel, which was 4 years ago. \u00a0At that time, I was soooo excited. \u00a0And once I started, the excitement only increased. \u00a0BUT, at the same time, I was hyper-vigilant about not physically changing; I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with that at all at the time. \u00a0When my voice sounded only the slightest bit different, I freaked and lowered the dose even more. \u00a0And I hit a sweet spot, where I stayed for almost 3 years.That sweet spot has shifted, and I\u2019m not sure where it is now! \u00a0And I\u2019m not all that excited about it either! \u00a0Who knows, I may hate it and stop after 2 or 3 shots.\u00a0 Or I may end up loving it more than I anticipated, and staying on it long-term. \u00a0My guess is I\u2019ll want to stay on for 6-8 months or so. \u00a0\u2026Let\u2019s see if I\u2019m right!\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
