Ollie just came out the end of last year and suffers from extreme gender dysphoria and depression. He has been going through a really rough time for a while now.\u00a0 He needs help and support so badly, and his dad does too.I looked up local mentorship programs to send to his dad because I really believe that if Ollie had a mentor in his life, he would have someone to relate to and to talk about what he is going through.\u00a0 Besides sending mentorship information, I thought there might be another way to help Ollie feel love and support right now. It might be a long shot, but I wanted to put it out there just in case you might be able to help me make this happen!I thought that it would be so great and powerful if people who went through similar hard times and came out the other side, were able to write a letter to Ollie telling him their story and how they overcame their challenges.\u00a0\u00a0This young soul is in desperate need of acceptance and love and I would appreciate any help or guidance you can give me in helping me make this \u201cLetters 2 Ollie\u201d project happen.I went ahead and created an email account that I can give to his dad to share with him once people start writing him letters. The email address is letters2ollie@gmail.com.\u00a0 I am hoping to get about 30 but would be grateful for any amount to be honest.I know this is an ambitious project and I want to thank you in advance for any help or guidance you can offer. You have my permission to forward this email to anyone you think might be able to help me make this \u201cLetters 2 Ollie\u201d project a reality. Thanks for your time!Best,Aldana ____________________Here\u2019s what I wrote to Ollie:Hey Ollie,My name is Kameron, and I\u2019m a 34 year-old trans-person. (Oh man, that makes me twice your age!)\u00a0 I wanted to write to you,\u00a0share a little bit about myself, and hopefully learn more about you.When I was 17, I was going through a really rough time too.\u00a0 I felt depressed, and stressed out about trying to make friends, plus juggling school, cross-country running, and a part-time job.\u00a0 (I worked at McDonald\u2019s.\u00a0 It sucked.)\u00a0 On top of all of this, I was putting a lot of pressure on myself to figure out my sexual identity (gender identity questions ended up coming later for me) and to be more open and honest. I was really shy.I decided that I must be a lesbian, since I was so masculine and it seemed like I would probably date women, although I wasn\u2019t so sure about that.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know about transgender identities.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know of anyone who was trans, or even what that really meant \u2013 it wasn\u2019t talked about at the time, and I didn\u2019t know about any resources.\u00a0 I could barely come to terms with the idea of being gay, anyway, so maybe it was for the best!\u00a0 To end up exploring these things in stages\u2026After a couple of months of feeling such intense pressure in my senior year of high school, I broke down and ended up in a psychiatric hospital for three weeks.\u00a0 The rest of that school year was really really hard.\u00a0 I had to drop out of a few of my classes.\u00a0 I went to more study halls and art classes, but that didn\u2019t really help.\u00a0 I was not able to focus on my school work or anything else, not\u00a0even TV!Things did get better though, slowly but surely.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to sound too cliche, but it does get better.\u00a0 At least for me it did.\u00a0 And I think if you were to really ask people who struggle with depression and gender dysphoria and everything else, most of them would tell you the same thing.My mom was supportive, and she found out about an LGBT youth group that I started going to every Sunday morning.\u00a0 (It prevented me from going to church with my parents, but I was secretly happy about that.)\u00a0 I will say that I found it difficult to connect with people at first, because I was so shy, but I at least started to feel a little bit more confident at my school.\u00a0 At the time, my school didn\u2019t even have a gay-straight alliance or any club like that!\u00a0 Does your school?When I went to college, a lot changed for me, largely because it was an opportunity to re-invent myself.\u00a0 Everyone was new.\u00a0 Also, I learned about so many things I was not aware of, including gender identity. \u00a0Do you have plans to go to college?\u00a0 Even if you don\u2019t, there are all sorts of opportunities to be the person you see yourself as, even if most people know you as someone else right now.\u00a0 Whether you join a new gym or start a new job or join a new group, I feel like people are more and more accepting and understanding about transgender identities, by the minute, these days.\u00a0 It\u2019s really incredible how fast things are changing.I would not have believed I could be where I am today, when I was 17 (the year you were born!\u00a0 Were you born in 1999?)\u00a0 I changed my pronouns to he/him/his about 10 years ago.\u00a0 I changed my name socially, and I want to change it legally too.\u00a0 I was on testosterone for a few years.\u00a0 I just had top surgery 3 weeks ago!\u00a0 My transition has ended up not being as straightforward, partly because I identify as non-binary, but that\u2019s a different story.\u00a0 Also, I got married to a totally amazing person, and I have a blog, and I\u2019m a radio DJ, and despite having some bouts of depression at different times, I am usually happy and want to get as much out of life as I can!I\u2019ve been thinking about you and hoping that things are at least getting a little better, every day.\u00a0 I wonder if you\u2019d want to write back and forth more?\u00a0 I\u2019d love to hear about what kinds of stuff you like.\u00a0 I just talked a whole lot about myself, but I\u2019m actually more interested in learning more about you!\u00a0 Also, if you want to ask me something, go for it! I doubt I will think anything is \u201ctoo personal.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m pretty open!Your pen pal, Kameron\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
