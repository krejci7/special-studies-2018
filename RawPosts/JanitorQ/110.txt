it\u2019s like a public opinion time capsule\u2026First off, the term \u201ctranssexual\u201d was used, and they got it wrong.\u00a0 They referred to FTM trans people as \u201ctranssexual women\u201d and MTF trans people as \u201ctranssexual men.\u201dPart 1 was about MTF trans people, and they focused on the stories of 3 people.\u00a0 One was just coming out, one had been out for about a year, living her \u201creal life test,\u201d and one was getting ready to have surgery.\u00a0 A LOT of time was devoted to her (Angela\u2019s) journey toward surgery; they even followed her to Montreal and were in the operating room with her and her wife.\u00a0 Angela was 59 and had just recently come out and starting taking hormones.\u00a0 This last step would \u201ccomplete her.\u201d\u00a0 (Her words.)\u00a0 They pointed out how lucky she was, in that she could pass and in that her wife stayed with her.\u00a0 She lived in Fresno, CA, and hosted a monthly support group in which people came from upward of 100 miles away to attend.There were a lot of sensationalistic soundbites.\u00a0 A couple: \u201cWhat pushes men to risk everything they have to become women?\u201d \u201cBelieving you were born in the wrong body may be a delusion that won\u2019t be corrected with surgery.\u201d \u201cSelf-diagnosed illness.\u201d \u201cWatching a parent change from male to female is bound to leave a strong mark on a child\u2019s psyche.\u201dA therapist was quoted as saying, basically, that people may be convinced they are a transsexual, but once they start the theraputic process, they may come up with alternatives to having to go through a sex change.Kenneth Zucker, from the Toronto Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, was on the program, basically saying that transsexual tendencies come from one\u2019s upbringing, and that kids have developmental plasticity, even if there is a biological predisposition.\u00a0 I recently read this blog post, partially about Zucker \u2013 apparently he is still around, but his clinic is under review, and is not accepting new patients.Part 2 started out with, \u201cThe story of four transsexual women, and their quest to live as men.\u201dSomeone named Thomas Wise, MD, from Johns Hopkins, was quoted liberally in both sections.\u00a0 More than once, he made an analogy to people struggling with anorexia.\u00a0 Basically, would you allow them to continue to make changes to their bodies because they see themselves as too fat?\u00a0 No?\u00a0 Why should we allow people who see themselves as the other gender make changes to their bodies?One of the stories was about someone named Dirk.\u00a0 He was getting testosterone through a urologist, and he was binding with a combination of ace bandages and sports bras (no mention of how dangerous this is.)More sensational sound bites: \u201cWhat defines a man?\u00a0 Can women ever become one?\u201d \u201cAre they real men?\u00a0 Imposters?\u00a0 Or something else?\u201d \u201cShe has started hormone injections, rendering him virtually unrecognizable.\u201dAgain, the segment focused heavily on surgeries (both top and bottom), again with footage from the OR.Twice, a study was brought up, from the Netherlands, in which scientists thought they may have pinpointed a part in the brain, the BSTC structure.\u00a0 In autopsied MTF people, the size was closer to that of a biological woman, and in FTM people, the opposite.\u00a0 Other scientists debunked the findings, saying that it was the cross-hormones that changed the brain structure.\u00a0 It was unclear what finding or not finding this evidence might imply for trans-people.This program was worthwhile in showing human stories, and that\u2019s what I remember taking away when I first watched it in 2006.\u00a0 Although it was invasive and sensationalistic, these were real people going through real adversity, and it felt important to me at the time.\u00a0 I told a friend who was also in the group that I had unearthed this video, and he said he has purposefully never watched it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t blame him.\u00a0 I mean, it\u2019s not something I would consider \u201csupportive\u201d of trans people.\u00a0 (That\u2019s a huge understatement).\u00a0 So for it to be given out at a support group \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s all that was available at the time \u2013 it\u2019s what was out there.It\u2019s reassuring to see that public opinion is changing, but there are still plenty of people who hold on to archaic notions about \u201ctranssexuals.\u201dStay tuned for part 2 \u2013 talking about an Oprah show about transgender children, and an A&E investigative reports:\u00a0 Transgender Revolution.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
