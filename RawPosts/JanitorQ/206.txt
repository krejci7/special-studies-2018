She said, \u201cOh ok, sorry, I thought you were someone else.\u00a0 My apologies.\u00a0 For my daughter.\u201d \u201cSure, no problem.\u201d\u00a0 She then told me her name (I forget now) and, \u201cNice to meet you.\u201dI walked away from that having no idea what motivated those questions or who she might have thought I was.\u00a0 No one ever mistakes me from someone else.\u00a0 I don\u2019t mean to be boastful, but I\u2019ve been told that I have a very distinct face so many times that it\u2019s become a source of internal pride.As I thought it through, all I could imagine was that this was a kindergartener here with her mom (she looked to be kindergarten age).\u00a0 The kids had been increasingly wondering whether I am a boy or a girl, and this one kid even spread the word to her mom.\u00a0 And her mom was helping clear it up for her.\u00a0 I\u2019d rather it not get cleared up!This is why I\u2019m seriously considering going by a masculine-sounding name.\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 21 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
