Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t get any documentation, cuz I was just focused on being there, in the moment.My drag name is Adam Andro-matic. \u00a0It\u2019s derived from Adam Ant, but, after all this time, I had never once portrayed him! \u00a0Not sure why! \u00a0One of the first CDs I bought with my own money, as a youth, from Media Play, was the best of Adam Ant. \u00a0I know almost all those hits and non-hits by heart. \u00a0As I planned out this performance, I really embraced it / him. \u00a0\u201cStrip\u201d is such a ridiculous song. \u00a0The video is even more so, I just learned! \u00a0But it\u2019s also just purely joyous, which is something I\u2019d never gotten from it, in the past.Last night, also, was just purely joyous. \u00a0I didn\u2019t have any pre-performance jitters or anxieties. \u00a0Generally, my anxieties around performing manifest\u00a0themselves by being too much of a perfectionist and obsessively timing things out. \u00a0This time, not at all! \u00a0I just went in there, hung out, got ready, did my thing, and then stayed in costume for the rest of the night, talking to people I\u2019d never talked to before, getting trapped into dancing with some drunk people who seemed to really want to dance with me, etc. \u00a0The birthday gal really really loved the striptease / lap-dance, and so did her boyfriend! \u00a0She hugged me a bunch of times and kissed my cheek. \u00a0This may have been the most fun I\u2019ve ever had, during a night I was performing. \u00a0All the stress was out of the equation. \u00a0So was the\u00a0extreme elation / relief when it was over, but I\u2019ll take the straight up\u00a0fun over all that intensity!The MC introduced me as Adam Andromeda. \u00a0Haha. \u00a0I\u2019ll have to think on that!Oh, and also, later in the night, I was dancing to a favorite song \u2013 \u201cRevenge\u201d by Ministry, when a woman I\u2019d never seen before came up to me. \u00a0She said, \u201cWill you come with me for a minute?\u201d \u00a0I followed her without hesitation, and she presented her boyfriend to me. \u00a0I knew this guy! \u00a0I\u2019m not great with faces, but I narrowed it down to it being 2 possible people\u2026 \u00a0We shook hands. \u00a0He said, \u201cDo you know me?\u201d \u00a0I said, \u201cYou work at [the food co-op].\u201d \u00a0He shook his head, no. \u00a0\u201cYou work at [school],\u201d I said next, and he affirmed that. \u00a0I see him almost every day, at the YMCA after school program where I work. \u00a0His girlfriend asked me, \u201cIs he good with the kids? \u00a0Do the kids love him?\u201d \u00a0I just nodded slowly, because the answer is, \u201cNo,\u201d from what I can observe, but she seemed to want to hear good things, haha. \u00a0He said he was buying me a drink. \u00a0I was pretty much done drinking by then, but I thought it\u2019d be nicer to accept. \u00a0I said,\u00a0sure, a PBR. \u00a0A couple of minutes later, he handed me TWO PBRs. \u00a0I shook my head and kept saying, \u201cno, just one!\u201d \u00a0But he kinda forced them, nicely, at me. \u00a0I took them both, drank half of one of them, and put them up on a piano, for safe-keeping. \u00a0Really the only reason I would waste beer \u2013 so that I can get home safely!Also, I saw my neighbor on the dance floor. \u00a0This tiny, older woman who is ALWAYS out at clubs and bars, dancing and not drinking. \u00a0She just seems so mild mannered!I stayed out till closing time. \u00a0Things had gotten really chaotic on the dance floor. \u00a0It was interesting to observe, dip my toes into\u2026 \u00a0When I got home I got ready to take a shower / get all the make-up off my face. \u00a0I noticed I had a kiss mark, from the birthday gal, on my cheek. \u00a0Haha.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
