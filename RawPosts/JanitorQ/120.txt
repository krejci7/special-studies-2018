maybe one day I will.\u00a0 This is an abbreviated version:Over night, my brain became a frenzied jumble of free associations.\u00a0 Every system I could imagine (friendships, technology, routines) opened up, and I was in the center of all of it, connecting all the dots.I thought that Leelah Alcorn, the trans-teen from Ohio who committed suicide, was an elaborately staged message created by a group of people on Tumblr.\u00a0 Meaning, I thought she was not a real person \u2013 more of a call to action, one more thing to add to \u201cThe Transgender Tipping Point,\u201d and finally really make some changes happen.But I thought a lot of things right around this time period, for a couple of days.\u00a0 I believed I\u2019d been chosen for amazing things, I was choosing my own adventure, and the further I could get before running into a dead-end setback, the more rewards I would gain.\u00a0 If I made it to my therapist\u2019s office, she was going to give me this new phone I\u2019ve had my eye on.\u00a0 If I made it through the entire day, I\u2019d be going to a party thrown by everyone I know.\u00a0 I briefly had the thought, \u201cMy partner wouldn\u2019t like that; that\u2019s too much.\u201d\u00a0 So my logic led me to believe I shouldn\u2019t make it through the day at this rate.\u00a0 I should definitely get the new phone, but I should see what my therapist thought after that.\u00a0 Maybe.Some things were already in motion, and there was no stopping me!\u00a0 My social media outlets were blowing up!\u00a0 My blog was going to get huge at this rate, and I was going to get a book deal out of it.\u00a0 Should I quit my job?\u00a0 I kinda like working there, as a janitor, so I\u2019ll keep my job.\u00a0 I better write a note so that everyone will know I wanna go back to work.\u00a0 I pulled out one of those Mr. Sketch scented markers \u2013 it was Blue Raspberry \u2013 and scrawled out really big and doodle-y on a piece of artist\u2019s paper, \u201cI will want to go back to work.\u201d\u00a0 It was barely legible.\u00a0 When I showed my therapist a few hours later, in fact, she couldn\u2019t read it, so I just had to tell her I want to go back to work.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t want to be someone who sits around all day, writing their book.\u00a0 I would get bored!I called my therapist at 2AM and asked her, \u201cCan you just come over?\u201d\u00a0 I called her again at 7AM, just to see if she\u2019d drop by instead of me meeting her at her office at 9.\u00a0 I was making some really cool displays in the house, and I wanted her to come check them out.\u00a0 I was playing a record \u2013 The Days of Wine and Roses by The Dream Syndicate, and everything was clicking into place.\u00a0 (Actually, the record is still on my turntable, untouched 4 months later \u2013 I\u2019m playing it right now.)\u00a0 The lyrics were making perfect sense and informing me of things I should write down.\u00a0 \u201cYou say it\u2019s a waste / not to learn from mistakes.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cTextbook case.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s Halloween.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cShe remembers what she said.\u201d\u00a0 These messages were of utmost importance.\u00a0 This record was THE record to end all records.By 8AM I was so bored and fidgety from doing stuff all night long, that I decided to take off for my therapy appointment early.\u00a0 I had everything I needed packed \u2013 My toothbrush and toothpaste, notes from work, and 6 bottles of hoarded Androgel (my prescription allows me to get more than I need, so I just collect them).\u00a0 I had no clue what would be happening next or how long I\u2019d be gone after therapy (I might be put up in a hotel!), but I could figure out clothes and other stuff later.Driving was a bit tricky.\u00a0 I was relying on intuitive cues, more than the rules of the road.\u00a0 Fortunately, my gut was telling me to slow way down and put my hazard lights on, rather than try to drive at the speed my mind was racing.\u00a0 I still got there early; when I arrived, I slammed my backpack into the corner of the waiting room, above the door.\u00a0 To alert the security cameras that I knew all about it.\u00a0 A man briskly walked past me and out the door.\u00a0 He was planted there to exit when I arrived.\u00a0 I proceeded to be loud and messy.\u00a0 I dumped out a bin of toys.\u00a0 I knocked over a chair.\u00a0 I said, \u201cI\u2019m borrrred!\u201d\u00a0 I talked loudly about a Mazda advertisement on the back cover of a magazine.\u00a0 I finally understood how advertising worked \u2013 they weren\u2019t fooling me!\u00a0 In fact, this whole magazine was rigged.\u00a0 I should just take it with me \u2013 I\u2019ll need it later.\u00a0 I stuffed it into my backpack.\u00a0 One other therapist was there (this was a Saturday) and she tried to gently corral me until my therapist got there.\u00a0 She picked up the toys.\u00a0 She said she\u2019d call my therapist for me.\u00a0 She talked to me in a steady and soothing voice.\u00a0 She wasn\u2019t patronizing me.Finally, my therapist arrived.\u00a0 We engaged in a delicate dance around each other.\u00a0 I knew on some level that I was going to the hospital.\u00a0 But I also knew that wasn\u2019t necessary, and she was totally going to come over and check out my displays and then I\u2019d be reunited with my partner to proceed with the most fun day ever!\u00a0 In reality, my partner was on her way to North Carolina with family (I\u2019d successfully convinced her everything was fine / I believed she was just out with friends and I\u2019d see her in a couple hours.)\u00a0 My therapist started calling hospitals for availability, and I conveniently went to the bathroom to shield myself from that stuff.\u00a0 I came back and dumped out all the contents of my backpack.\u00a0 This would be more fun.\u00a0 She immediately sorted things into piles to make sense of it.\u00a0 She called my partner and left a message.\u00a0 She asked me what my best friend\u2019s phone number was and I told her.\u00a0 I left the room again while she talked on the phone.\u00a0 Before I knew it, my best friend was there!\u00a0 Magic!\u00a0 Everything was going my way.I talked to my friend about the displays and we played Rubix cube.\u00a0 Suddenly we were all leaving.\u00a0 They led the way, and I went into the bathroom again.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t so sure anymore.\u00a0 I yelled out, \u201cI set some things in motion, and I don\u2019t know if I want it to go this far.\u201d\u00a0 We were still just going to my house, right?\u00a0 My therapist replied, with forced enthusiasm, \u201cCome on!\u201dI got in the car with her; my best friend went separately.\u00a0 I curled up into a ball and shielded my eyes from the world.\u00a0 I started to feel sad; I verbalized what I thought about Leelah Alcorn.\u00a0 I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know much about it.\u00a0 I know her name, where she\u2019s from, and that\u2019s about it.\u201d\u00a0 She had been on the news.\u00a0 That was big.\u00a0 What I was trying to convey was that no one knew much about it.\u00a0 If everyone just saw her picture, her name, and her suicide note, maybe she wasn\u2019t real.\u00a0 And maybe this kind of stuff happens all the time.\u00a0 What is real in the media?\u00a0 Scattered thoughts breaking down.\u00a0 My therapist said, \u201cI don\u2019t actually know where you live.\u201d\u00a0 I replied, desperately, \u201cYeah, but you can find out.\u201d\u00a0 She had a smart phone.\u00a0 People with smart phones seamlessly glean information all the time.We weren\u2019t going to my house.\u00a0 When we stopped and I uncurled myself, we were at the hospital.\u00a0 But it still wasn\u2019t too late.\u00a0 If I just told her this is where it ends, and we go to my house from here, everything could still be OK.\u00a0 I looked her straight in the eye; I put my face two inches from her face.\u00a0 I said, \u201cThis is where it ends.\u201d\u00a0 This had worked with my partner a few hours earlier.\u00a0 I looked her straight in the eye and said, \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d\u00a0 I gave her the green light to go on her trip.\u00a0 This time was different.\u00a0 My therapist probably interpreted that as, \u201cThe journey ends here, at the hospital.\u201d\u00a0 I meant here in the car.\u00a0 Still though, I complied and followed her.\u00a0 After all, my best friend showed up here too, so it probably was all OK.Five hours later, I was on the psych ward.\u00a0 I\u2019d been in the emergency department.\u00a0 My mom had shown up.\u00a0 I had talked to my partner on the phone \u2013 it finally sunk in she was 6 hours away, and she and her family were turning straight around.\u00a0 My best friend had been with me.\u00a0 My therapist had left at some point.\u00a0 I\u2019d peed in a cup.\u00a0 I\u2019d gotten blood drawn.\u00a0 I\u2019d signed some papers by drawing big loops over the entire page, not knowing what I was signing, exactly.\u00a0 But now, it was just me, and suddenly my choose your own adventure had come to a dead halt.\u00a0 There was no more choosing.\u00a0 I started yelling, panicking.\u00a0 \u201cI NEED MY VITAMIN D PILL AND ELDERBERRY SUPPLEMENT!\u201d\u00a0 I needed to maintain my body\u2019s delicate homeostatic state.\u00a0 I was given a pill and took it; it was Haldol.\u00a0 It knocked me out for 18 hours.\u00a0 Before I faded out, the nurse was talking to me really sternly.\u00a0 She was really butch.\u00a0 \u201cDo not start shouting on my unit \u2013 we don\u2019t do that.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI know I know it\u2019s not like me at all\u2026\u201d\u00a0 \u201cAlso, you smell really strongly bad so I\u2019m going to shut your door.\u201d\u00a0 Then she started yelling.\u00a0 \u201cHe gets whatever he wants!\u201d\u00a0 And I was out.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
