They have been portrayed to be long-lived or immortal and as beings of magical powers.\u00a0In Norse paganism, Light elves were beautiful creatures and were considered to be \u2018guardian angels.\u2019\u00a0 Light elves were minor gods of nature and fertility; they could help or hinder, humans with their knowledge of magical powers. They also often delivered an inspiration to art or music.\u201dIn contrast,\u201cThe Dark Elves hated the sun and it\u2019s sunlight, because if they were touched or exposed to it they would immediately turn into stone. They use to annoy and threaten humans, to the point that nightmares were thought to be produced by the Dark Elves.These elves could also haunt animals, especially horses. They are also known as dwarfs. \u201cElves are known to be playful, mischievous, and flighty, yet loyal and duty-bound.\u00a0 So, to rule with this wisdom can only be a good thing!\u00a0 To \u201crule with dwarf wisdom,\u201d if there were such a thing, might be something else entirely. __________________________________________I have not heard any follow-ups from the Washington Post reporter in over a week, so I\u2019m assuming she went with someone else.\u00a0 I\u2019m kinda bummed \u2013 it felt like it would have been a good personal challenge.\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019ll have more opportunities to talk with more people in the future\u2026\u00a0 I\u2019ll share the link to the story as soon as I come across it.Having the chance to talk with her via phone and then to think about the potential of her coming here to hang out with me as I live my life definitely made some specific types of thoughts more pronounced, for many many days in a row.\u00a0 Mainly, what do I want to share with others, and what feels too vulnerable?\u00a0 Hypothetically, to what extent would I choose to be anonymous?\u00a0 These questions have been on my mind quite a bit for a while, but suddenly it felt like I might need to make some definitive choices.\u00a0 And even though the pressure\u2019s off on those decisions, I\u2019m still pressing myself about it, at least some of it.\u00a0 I finally decided to settle on a new name.The name situation has been a thing I haven\u2019t directly addressed but have thought about for roughly 10+ years (like a lot of particulars about my gender identity).\u00a0 I do not like to go by my legal name, or the name I used growing up.\u00a0 Somewhere in my mid-twenties, I skewed it slightly, and that started to stick \u2013 almost everyone knows me by this slightly masculinized version of a pretty feminine name.\u00a0 But ultimately, it\u2019s not what I want.\u00a0 I\u2019ve toyed with the idea (off-and-on) of going by a male name.\u00a0 The biggest contenders were Adam (this is my drag persona) and Konrad (just because I like it).But, I have to admit that ultimately, it would be too hard for me to request a name like that if I\u2019m not ever going to be appearing definitively male.\u00a0 I wish it were no big thing.\u00a0 And to many people, I imagine it wouldn\u2019t be, and they\u2019d easily make the switch.\u00a0 Just\u2026 it would be too awkward for me.\u00a0 I already know.Ideally, I\u2019ve wanted to go by a name that is right in the middle of androgyny.\u00a0 I mean, a lot of names can be male or female names, but usually, they\u2019re much more commonly used for one over the other.I talked to my partner about a potential new name about a week ago.\u00a0 This is a conversation we\u2019ve had at other points in time, for sure.\u00a0 But it was always more whimsical \u2013 sort of like, what if?\u2026\u00a0 This time it was more like, OK, I really need to pick now.\u00a0 I have this piece of writing I want to submit to our local LGBT literary magazine, and it\u2019s due in 3 days, and I need a pen name!That ended up being pretty tense; note to self \u2013 don\u2019t try to rush these kinds of decisions.\u00a0 Haha.\u00a0 But we got through it; she helped me come to a name that I\u2019m going to start using ASAP as a pen name.\u00a0 Avery.\u00a0 And if I still like it, I\u2019ll start using it more and more online, and then if I\u2019m still liking it, the big switch to real life (which I envision will involve legally changing it as well.)\u00a0 But all that feels pretty scary, so for now, it\u2019s just a pen name.\u201cAvery\u201d definitely seems androgynous to me \u2013 maybe skewed more to masculine, but feels like either, for sure.\u00a0 I looked up the origin / what it means, and that pretty much sealed the deal.\u00a0 A few websites confirmed, \u201cthe name literally means, \u2018ruling with elf wisdom.'\u201dNot sure if I could find a better fit!!!I am a known elf.I rule all.If you picked out your name, how did you come to it / narrow it down???more evidencenever not an elf.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
