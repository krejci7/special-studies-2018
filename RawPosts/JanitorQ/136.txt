relatives at least know I prefer male pronouns.\u00a0 In new situations, I plan to let people know about male pronouns whenever I feel like I comfortably can.\u00a0 But work has been a challenge, in my mind.A big part of that is, what would I be asking for, exactly?\u00a0 Male pronouns, and a name change down the road.\u00a0 What about bathrooms?\u00a0 What about my appearance?\u00a0 I won\u2019t be looking any different, as opposed to other trans-people who transition from one gender to the other.\u00a0 Is this too much to ask for?\u00a0 And what about kids and parents?\u00a0 Where do they fit in?\u00a0 I see teachers getting on board (Maybe?\u00a0 One day?), but how much can I hope for it to trickle down to students and their parents?\u00a0 Does it matter to me that much?Right now, this is hurting my head.\u00a0 BUT, a couple of weeks ago, I took a first step!\u00a0 I had been wanting to fill the principal in about my recent hospitalization and absence.\u00a0 At the time it happened, I was vague and just left it at I was hospitalized.\u00a0 I did want to let her know the nature of the occurrence and just touch base about where I\u2019m at.\u00a0 I figured it would be a good time to also give her a heads up about my trans-identity.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t plan to ask for any accommodations or change-overs at this time \u2013 just wanted to let her know.So I waited for a good time after school when she was still in the building.\u00a0 I\u2019d been psyching myself up for a few days, so the day I decided I could do it, it was definitely going to happen.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 I knew she was getting ready for a kindergarten registration event that evening, but it kinda had to be NOW!\u00a0 I kept it short, knowing she had other things.I just popped in her office, said I\u2019d like to touch base about where I\u2019m at \u2013 she asked me how I was doing and I said, \u201cMuch better.\u201d\u00a0 Which was kinda true in the moment, but not true later on.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been on a roller coaster with new med adjustments and things, but I didn\u2019t get into all of that.\u00a0 I just told her that the reason I went out was that due to personal stress and work stress, I could sense my thoughts getting extremely confused and disorganized.\u00a0 I sought out help from my therapist, and she\u2019s the one who brought me to the hospital.\u00a0 I\u2019m on new meds, for now at least (the principal asked about side effects) and seeing my therapist more often for the time being.\u00a0 The principal was open and supportive.She started to wrap things up by talking about cleaning for tonight (with the event), so I knew I had to jump in with my other purpose before the moment passed.\u00a0 I said, \u201cI do have another thing to bring up, about where I\u2019m at.\u00a0 I wanted to let you know that I identify as transgender.\u201d\u00a0 I went on to specify that most people who ID this way transition from one gender to the other, and I don\u2019t feel that \u2013 I feel like I am in the middle.\u00a0 That I\u2019ve been in this process for years, and work is the last place.\u00a0 That I\u2019m on testosterone but such a low dose that my appearance won\u2019t be changing.\u00a0 That I prefer male pronouns and plan to change my name at some point.\u00a0 She listened intently and asked what I needed.\u00a0 I said nothing right now, just time to maybe talk to other people within the school and come out on my own terms.\u00a0 Maybe at some point an email but nothing right now.\u00a0 Just eventually a name and pronoun change.\u00a0 I asked her if she had any context for knowing about trans-people, and she said yes.\u00a0 And that was about it.\u00a0 I wrapped it up really quickly and told her thank you.\u00a0 She said thank you to me too.I don\u2019t know what this means other than one tiny step.\u00a0 Right now everything has felt so hard, this feels like nothing.\u00a0 I think in time, it may feel like I opened doors up to take further steps, but as of now, it just feels like something I got out of the way.Here\u2019s to happier days ahead.\u00a0 I should be happy about this, and hopefully it will sink in later\u2026\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
