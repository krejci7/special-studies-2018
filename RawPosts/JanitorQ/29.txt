I was in the hospital for psychiatric reasons, for a week in mid-May.  It went so much smoother than my two other “stays.”  (Those occurred in 1999 and 2015).  I attribute that smoothness to:– Having a complete social network around me for the first time in my life– The fact that even though I had never been to THIS hospital, I was able to draw from my experience in 2015, and use that blueprint to (semi)-successfully navigate my way through, this time around.– I was already on meds that were working pretty well, for the first time ever.  This means that my psychiatrist wasn’t just taking a shot in the dark.  She was just tweaking what was already working.  (For me, specifically, this meant getting my Seroquel (anti-psychotic) increased from 200mg, to 600mg, dispersed into three 200mg doses throughout the day, and discontinuing the Wellbutrin (anti-depressant), at least for now.*So, what were my priorities? 1. Getting on an adequate sleep schedule. 2. Eating the hospital food without having too many digestive issues (this included not relying too heavily on food visitors brought me, even though I was so grateful that they were doing this.) 3. Interacting as opposed to shutting down:  Unless I was knocked out on meds, I was up and about, talking with people (sometimes shouting at them), pacing the halls (“going for a walk”), coloring with different medias and different methods / trying to do number puzzles (figuring out what was feeling more “right brained / left brained”), marking my turf / territory in ways that may have been specific to me (this, right here, would be a post unto itself… I’ll leave that for another day…Some peripheral priorities / goals that I tackled / attempted and had some success with was: 1. Watching out for other people, checking in to see if they felt safe. 2. Micromanaging free-dance party / art times. 3. Getting other people condiments and other things they might need / want. 4. Modeling my behavior off of others / acting as a role model. 5. Pushing for Gym Time and Therapy Dog visits. 6. Reinforcing privacy vs. getting help.  Also reinforcing quiet hours and other scheduled parts of the day. 7. Taking a shower every day (night) at the same time (10pm). 8. Dispensing important information. ____________________________________________________Notes:I realize this post is a pretty vague sketch of some important things – this might serve as just an outline for me to fill in more interesting details / experiences / stories…*I was also administered a shot, which I refer to as a “Haldol Cocktail.”  5 parts Haldol, 2 parts Ativan, 50 parts Benadryl.  Plus, of course, my Testosterone shot – 50mg.
