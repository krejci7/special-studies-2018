I\u2019m definitely feeling like I\u2019m in it for the long term (both taking T and writing this blog), so it\u2019s more like spurts of data over a lot period of time, rather than data overload and then burnout, or something like that.\u00a0 2.\u00a0 There\u2019s really not a whole lot to report!\u00a0 I mean, I\u2019ve been experiencing a ton of internal changes.\u00a0 But things are feeling pretty stabilized, and there\u2019s not a ton of exciting new information.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a recap / rundown:I\u2019m using Androgel 1%, 1 pump (1.25g) daily.Physical changes:\u00a0 what I have noticed has been sooooo minimal, which I\u2019m so psyched about.\u00a0 And these changes happened within the first 2-3 months, and I\u2019m not seeing much new here since.\u00a0 I noticed a slight filling out of my mustache, a few longer light-colored hairs on my chin, a slight broadening of my shoulders with some muscle growth in my pecs, biceps, and shoulders.\u00a0 My clitoris got bigger over the course of a few days about 2 months in, and hasn\u2019t changed since then.\u00a0 I\u2019ve gotten a little sweatier and smellier (feeling the desire to shower more frequently), and I seem to have a higher tolerance for cold, which is awesome!\u00a0 There is one physical change that I\u2019m noticing more recently:\u00a0 I\u2019m seeing slightly darker hairs at the application site.\u00a0 I apply the gel to my upper thighs, and there\u2019s definitely some slight hair growth.\u00a0 The one change I\u2019m feeling ambivalent about and unsure of is voice dropping.\u00a0 I keep being hyper aware and concerned.\u00a0 No one else seems to be able to tell there is any difference.\u00a0 So far, I haven\u2019t made vocal recordings because I don\u2019t want to obsess over it any more than I already am.\u00a0 I think the difference is so slight, and that voices are moving, dynamic, changing things anyway, that there\u2019s really no cause for concern.\u00a0 Largely, I worry that certain changes plateaued soon and were pretty negligible, but that perhaps my voice will keep dropping the longer I\u2019m on T.\u00a0 I\u2019ll just have to wait to find out.\u00a0 I may start making voice recordings, if I think it\u2019ll help.Internal changes:\u00a0 The internal changes I talked about at 5 months included drastic decrease in anxiety, increase in sex drive, feeling grounded and connected and warm and fuzzy, and changes in sensations of pain.\u00a0 I\u2019m still reveling in all of these things.\u00a0 It is still plenty of reason to keep taking T, despite my concern over experiencing physical changes.\u00a0 For about 6 months, my anxiety levels were at 0, which I have never experienced before in my entire life.\u00a0 Now they\u2019re fluctuating, like life tends to cause, but at a much lower, more tolerable level, than I was experiencing pre-T.\u00a0 Increased sex drive feels sustainable, and has allowed me to explore new (dormant?) areas of my sexuality I hadn\u2019t been able to tap into before.\u00a0 Sensations of pain and feeling connected to my body have been starting to dwindle in awesomeness, I think because I\u2019m getting used to it, and can\u2019t recall what it used to feel like, to compare then and now, as much.\u00a0 Everything is dwindling in awesomeness, and I keep trying to remind myself how different in a negative way, my bodily experiences were, pre-T.The effects of T have been a dream come true for me.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be back with a T update in a few more months!\u00a0 (These photos are from 5 months and then 8 months.\u00a0 I guess I\u2019m looking at whether there\u2019s a change in my face shape over time.\u00a0 So far, I can\u2019t notice anything.\u00a0 This pleases me.)\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 23 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
