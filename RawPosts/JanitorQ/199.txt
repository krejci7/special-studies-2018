Last week, I made a video using my computer for the first time.Â  If youâ€™ll bear with me for the first 25 seconds, I do eventually start talking.Â  It gets off to a slow start, as I am momentarily mesmerized by my own interior decorating.Â  ðŸ™‚I posted this video on YouTube on a new collaborative channel called Undefine Me.Â  The channel has a handful of people who identify in a lot of different ways, talking on a weekly basis about sexuality, gender, and similar topics.Â  I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be contributing much by way of video, but Iâ€™ve started writing on their blog.Â  You can too, if you feel so inclined!The reason I decided to make a video is because I feel like I have something to say.Â  And Iâ€™ve been writing an awful lot about it here on my blog.Â  (So if you read this blog, all the info in the video will be redundant!)Â  But I think there are a lot of people who might be more inclined to watch a video than to read a blog post.Â  (I am not one of those people!)Â  So, this video is for them, and Iâ€™m putting it out there in the hopes theyâ€™ll somehow find it.Â Â
