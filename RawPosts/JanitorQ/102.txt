\u2013 Previous breast history?- Some cancers are more prevalent in persons of different racial and ethnic backgrounds.\u00a0 The following information will help us to better understand your potential risk in developing certain types of cancers and to understand your prognosis.\u00a0 [Followed by questions about ethnicity.] \u2013 What percentage of waking hours do you spend up and about? \u2013 more than 50% \u2013 less thank 50% \u2013 I am confined to a bed or chair \u2013 I am completely disabled, totally confined to a bed or chairOn the phone, when I scheduled the appointment, the woman was sensitive to the reason I was coming in, and to the fact I hadn\u2019t legally changed my name yet.\u00a0 Regardless, that didn\u2019t translate over to the present day, and I was called by my birth name and even, \u201cMrs. [last name].\u201d\u00a0 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever before been called \u201cMrs. [last name].\u201dI finally was brought up to the breast cancer suite and my vitals were taken.\u00a0 I waited in an exam room and a nurse came in and went over some of the questions with me.\u00a0 She left for a while and came back, saying, \u201clet\u2019s fill out this paperwork.\u201d\u00a0 This one WAS relevant to why I was there.\u00a0 I asked her, \u201cWhy was I filling out papers for breast cancer patients?\u201d\u00a0 She replied, \u201cOh, well, they just gave you the wrong one down stairs.\u201d\u00a0 No big deal\u2026 ???She left and a doctor with an intern student came in.\u00a0 The doctor asked if it was OK if the student was present, and introduced her.\u00a0 She then asked, \u201cAre you so-and-so?\u201d\u00a0 I said no I\u2019m not.\u00a0 She said, \u201coops, sorry, wrong room.\u201d\u00a0 I sat there waiting a while longer and finally the surgeon came in with TWO student interns.\u00a0 At no point did she ask for my consent for them to be present.\u00a0 They introduced themselves and we got started.\u00a0 She started by putting words in my mouth \u2013 \u201cSo you\u2019ve felt this way since you were a teenager.\u00a0 That\u2019s when you started feeling different\u2026\u201d\u00a0 I just let her roll with that.\u00a0 She asked about mental health, suicidal thoughts, and even self-injury.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure why.\u00a0 She asked very little about gender identity.\u00a0 I answered her questions honestly, including that I\u2019ve had vague suicidal thoughts, and I used to use self-injury as a coping mechanism.She then said they were going to leave the room and prompted me to put the robe on.\u00a0 They were gone a very long time.\u00a0 They all came back, rubbing hand sanitizer into their hands.\u00a0 I had a flash fear thought \u2013 are all these people going to be touching me?!!!\u00a0 Fortunately only the surgeon touched me, but the presence of all these people was enough for me to check out for this part of the appointment.\u00a0 A few things that registered:\u2013 She commented on my tattoo, asking if that was magic marker \u2013 it looked like marker.\u00a0 ??? \u2013 She talked a lot while I was sitting there half exposed.\u00a0 She described the procedure she would do, and manipulated my breast in her hand to demonstrate it.\u00a0 I looked down briefly, and seeing her grabbing my breast was totally surreal.\u00a0 She was talking at my chest, and not to my face.\u00a0 I was poked and prodded a lot more than seemed necessary. \u2013 She actually said to me, \u201cThis scar, is this from cutting?\u201d\u00a0 I could not believe I was being asked this.\u00a0 I was in shock. \u2013 I was aware of interns in the background, watching this whole thing.\u00a0 They were fuzzy. \u2013 I said to her, \u201cI\u2019m just in the consultation phase, and I have some questions for you.\u201d\u00a0 This changed the dynamic and she wrapped up the part where I was sitting there, vulnerable.When this part was finally over, they left and I got dressed.\u00a0 I waited a very long time again.\u00a0 When they came back, I went through my list of questions.\u00a0 She has a year and a half of experience working with trans-patients (really?!!), and does chest masculinizing surgeries a couple times per month.\u00a0 She requires patients to be off T one week before and one week after surgery.\u00a0 50% of patients will immediately retain nipple sensation, and 80% will eventually over time regain sensation.\u00a0 She could not show me any examples of her work that would be related to my surgery type.\u00a0 She could not tell me how much it would cost, not even a ballpark estimate.Before leaving, I gave her feedback.\u00a0 I told her how I had been misgendered by the staff.\u00a0 She conceded that they needed to work on that.\u00a0 I also, in front of the students, said, \u201cAs someone who is transgender, I have gender dysphoria around my naked body.\u00a0 These may not be the best types of appointments to have students present.\u00a0 It felt like I had an audience, and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable being partially exposed.\u201d\u00a0 She responded, \u201cThank you for that feedback.\u201d\u00a0 I understand she might not have control over when she has interns with her, but she could CERTAINLY ask for consent, or ask that the interns not be present for the naked part.\u00a0 I wanted to give her more personal feedback, such as, \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate to comment on my body,\u201d but in the end I didn\u2019t go there.\u00a0 I just couldn\u2019t right then.This surgeon and the staff could benefit from some trans-related training, particularly to the sensitivities trans-people may feel about their naked bodies, specifically chests.\u00a0 Make it short and sweet!\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
