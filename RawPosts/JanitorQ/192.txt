By the end of February, I\u2019d found a promising candidate, only to realize she\u2019s part of a women\u2019s health group. My last appointment with my doctor, at the end of March, was an absurdist performance piece.It has been challenging to find appropriate health care where I live, but I\u2019ve plowed ahead anyway because:\u00a0 1)I know what I am trying to get, and 2)I don\u2019t see any reason why I should not get it.\u00a0 This new doctor has no expertise in trans* identities, and I knew that going in.\u00a0 But I did find her through the local gay alliance\u2019s resource page, so that was a start.\u00a0 When I told her that this is how I came to be here, she replied, \u201cWell\u2026 yes, I am LGBT friendly, but I don\u2019t know how I got on that list.\u201d\u00a0 What does that mean???When I told her the reason I\u2019m here is to get more Androgel, she replied that she does not feel qualified to prescribe hormones.\u00a0 That was the start of the discussion, but by the end, she was giving me a prescription for exactly what I said I\u2019ve been on for over a year already, and she was changing her tune to, \u201cI suppose I could for the time being, but the long-term health risks are too great, and it\u2019s not my area of expertise.\u201dI told her I\u2019ve been going to the one trans* specific doctor in the area who treats adults (that I know about), and I want to switch because I do not like him.\u00a0 She used her laptop to confirm she knew of no local doctors, aside from the clinic that treats adolescents and young adults.\u00a0 She suggested I could use her as my PCP and still go to my other doctor for the hormones.\u00a0 I told her I was not going to do this.\u00a0 She then suggested she might be able to get me in at the adolescent clinic for a one-time visit, so that she can then be advised by them about my care.\u00a0 I told her that would be amazing.\u00a0 She will be following up with me on this, and I would be happy to go.I told her how I perceive my gender identity, why I\u2019m taking testosterone, and that it does not involve much health risk for me personally.\u00a0 She said, even so, she did not know enough about it.\u00a0 I asked her, \u201cWhat if a woman wanted to take testosterone to address issues with a low sex-drive?\u201d\u00a0 (Women do this.)\u00a0 She said that she would not use testosterone as a treatment.\u00a0 It\u2019s not been proven to be effective.\u00a0 She continued on to say that she does have some male patients (husbands, sons, etc. of patients, who want to come here), and some have low testosterone levels, and she\u2019s not the one to prescribe them testosterone.\u00a0 I found this difficult to believe.I showed her a copy of my latest blood tests, and this is when the tables started to turn.\u00a0 I saw her open up.\u00a0 I illustrated what I knew by telling her what \u201cnormal\u201d female and male ranges were, and where I fall within that.\u00a0 I told her that risks such as increased blood pressure, red-blood cell count, cholesterol, etc., are real concerns that can be monitored through blood work, but I believe I counteract those risks anyway with my lifestyle (vegetarian diet, active profession, don\u2019t smoke, drink only moderately.)I told her, bluntly, \u201cIt\u2019s not that complicated.\u201dAnd, in the end, she seemed OK with it.\u00a0 She was asking me what diagnosis I would like her to put for insurance purposes.\u00a0 I told her that Gender Identity Disorder is in the DSM \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t like it, but it\u2019s there.\u201d\u00a0 She responded with, \u201cWhat about \u2018hormone treatment for transgender patients?\u2019\u00a0 Well, you don\u2019t identify as transgender\u2026\u201d\u00a0 I told her that I do, that \u201ctransgender\u201d is an umbrella term, and that diagnosis works OK.I went by this new name I\u2019m trying out, at the doctor\u2019s office.\u00a0 I figured this is a compartmentalized atmosphere, and a good place to see what it feels like.\u00a0 I gotta say, it didn\u2019t feel great.\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure what that\u2019s about yet.\u00a0 If that means this just isn\u2019t the name for me, or if I\u2019d actually feel this way about any new name, because any and all would feel foreign at first.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure my gut will tell me.\u00a0 And time.\u00a0 Time will tell me.\u00a0 I also told her I\u2019d like to go by male pronouns.\u00a0 She said, \u201cWe can do our best with this.\u00a0 You\u2019ll probably have to remind us, but we\u2019ll try.\u201d\u00a0 Her body language while she said this conveyed, \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u00a0 I\u2019m not really going to try, but feel free to try to get us to try.\u201dAnd this is where things are.\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
