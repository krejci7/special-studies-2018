Thank you to Austin (T Minus Zero) for choosing me for the chain style Liebster Award.  The way it works is, if you’re chosen, you then choose a bunch of other blogs you like, and it branches out from there.  I imagine the pattern of these awards swirling, dead-ending, and splintering/multiplying, over time, forever and ever.  It’s a great opportunity to find out about other blogs and connect with one another.I have a tendency to not follow the rules completely, but if I choose your blog and you would like to follow rules, here they are:1. Thank the blogger who nominated you.2. Answer the 11 questions the blogger gives you.3. Nominate bloggers who you think are deserving of the award but also help promote newer bloggers with less followers.4. Tell the bloggers you nominated them, in a comment on their blog.5. Give them 11 questions of your own.I’m going to do a conglomeration of questions that were posed, on a couple of blogs.  If I choose your blog, you can answer these same questions, and/or come up with your own:Gender:  AwesomeLetters for LesLife Writ LargeAFRIcTRANsSingle White She MaletransnewlifeBecoming VincentJosephine the SingerLet’s keep this snowballing!
