But, not so much prepared for the recovery process\u2026office/home/guest rooms mansionSurgery Day:\u00a0 We arrived at 6:15am, surgery was from 7:30-9am, I was sleeping till about 10:30, and we were leaving by 11:30.\u00a0 At which point, I felt a lot better than I had for days \u2013 it even felt like my cold magically disappeared.Everything went smoothly, except for the fact that the surgeon was about to do the wrong procedure.\u00a0 I was afraid this was the case because during the entire process including the consultation, the paperwork continually listed \u201cdouble incision mastectomy with free nipple grafts.\u201d\u00a0 Even after I called a month ago to verify we were on the same page with the peri-areolar procedure and was assured that we were.\u00a0 So when she came in and said, \u201cDouble incision.\u201d\u00a0 I said no, and luckily wasn\u2019t phased by the mix up.\u00a0\u00a0 She said peri-areolar, I said yes, and she drew circles around my areolas.\u00a0 I talked to her about nipple size, saying I wanted them small.\u00a0 She said, \u201cThey\u2019ll be smaller.\u00a0 Your nipples will be nipple-sized.\u201d\u00a0 That was not very reassuring, but after she left, and before the anesthesiologist came back around, my spouse clarified that she had said, \u201cyour nipples will be nickle-sized.\u201d\u00a0 That sounded better.If you want to read a more detailed account of what it\u2019s like, here\u2019s a good one someone wrote just a few days ago:\u00a0 Surgery.\u00a0 It was a lot like that.\u00a0Back at the guest room, we texted with some people, a Philly friend came and visited for a while, we watched Seinfeld, and we went to sleep early.\u00a0 I was up a lot that night, ravenously eating snacks and just not able to get comfortable.\u00a0 I was sleeping sitting up, at the foot of the bed, a lot.Day after surgery \u2013 The next day, we were driving home.\u00a0 And I was in bed by 6pm.\u00a0 My cold symptoms were back, and I was not feeling so good anymore.\u00a0 I\u2019ll bet that first day, I had a good mix of adrenaline and endorphins flowing, plus whatever they put in the IV.\u00a0 And then I crash.2 days after surgery \u2013 I sat outside for a while.\u00a0 A friend came over, and we chatted for about 30 minutes before my spouse and they went thrift shopping.\u00a0 We listened to some podcasts.\u00a0 I read a book about subway art, written in 1984, a book I had found in the trash at school.\u00a0 We watched 2 episodes of Mad Men.Drinking water.\u00a0 Feeling pretty good.Drinking water. (I did not plan on wearing this Hawaiian shirt. Turns out I don\u2019t have that many short sleeved button down shirts that will comfortably fit over the drains!)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03 days \u2013 Podcasts, Mad Men.\u00a0 I stopped taking the pain meds (Percocet) because they were causing OIC (opioid induced constipation).\u00a0 The pain increased throughout the day, but it\u2019s not like Percocet was all that effective anyway.\u00a0 We went to my spouse\u2019s parents\u2019 house, which did not go so well (I could not bear being social, especially once a family friend came by \u2013 I just went and sat outside.)\u00a0 We went to the grocery store on the way home \u2013 that was OK.4 days \u2013 Glad to be off Percocet \u2013 realized that there are other pain meds (D\u2019uh!) so I took an Alieve.\u00a0 I feel like 95% of the pain now is due to this fucking surgical wrap I have to wear for 7 days.\u00a0 I can only take shallow breaths; I can\u2019t laugh or yawn or cough; it\u2019s digging into my ribs and underarms; it\u2019s way too tight; it just fucking sucks*.\u00a0 There\u2019s a reason I didn\u2019t bind!\u00a0 We went to the movies \u2013 nice to get out of the house.\u00a0 Also, one of our cats got suddenly freaked out by my Frankenstein walk (even though I\u2019ve been doing it for days), and she bolted off the table, knocking a bunch of my records onto the floor.\u00a0 It was loud.\u00a0 Also, I had a mini melt down about hating asking for things that are so basic, telling my spouse that I keep doing things because I would rather do them than ask \u2013 open and close doors, get ice trays out of the freezer, pour water from our britta, reach up high for a Q-tip, carry my laptop\u2026\u00a0 I gotta stop so I don\u2019t mess up my healing process!\u00a0 She was on it and strategized a bunch of new ways to make things easier!5 days \u2013 My spouse went back to work.\u00a0 Our refrigerator was making a loud noise this morning and stopped working.\u00a0 That was stressful!\u00a0 I called a repair person, then changed my mind because we should just buy a new one because this thing is super old.\u00a0 My spouse\u2019s mom came over to save our freezer items for us, store them at her house.\u00a0 Then the fridge started working again, so it feels like less pressure \u2013 we\u2019ll still get a new one, but it doesn\u2019t have to be today.\u00a0 A friend brought over lunch \u2013 I liked that!\u00a0 My mom stopped by after work.\u00a0 I felt anxious and lightheaded for a lot of the day.\u00a0 I was feeling really confined/claustrophobic, as if this binding thing were made of plaster of paris, or steel.\u00a0 I had a serious melt down (I got an all-too-real glimpse of what it could feel like, if I lost it right now \u2013 I felt in danger of becoming more and more triggered), and told my spouse we need more people around us, helping.\u00a0 She called her parents to make that happen.\u00a0 We talked and I felt a lot better.6 days \u2013 That\u2019s today!\u00a0 I only managed to sleep 3 hrs.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be spending more time with people today.\u00a0 I\u2019m just going to try to relax.\u00a0 I also gotta start preparing for going back down there tomorrow, to get this fucking binding off.\u00a0 Oh, and the drains.\u00a0 I\u2019m going with my mom.Overall, I\u2019m in more pain than I thought.\u00a0 And I\u2019m way less out of it than I thought (like, I didn\u2019t get to be in a fun pain-killer induced haze, haha).\u00a0 And I don\u2019t like TV that much and I\u2019ve been up and about a lot.\u00a0 I hate not doing things because it reminds me of being depressed.*\u00a0 Note:\u00a0 this may be the only time I\u2019ve used swear words on this blog (in reference to the surgical binding).\u00a0 It\u2019s that bad.\u00a0 Also, though, I appreciate this thing because it reminds me of where the limits are and also it\u2019s preventing me from coughing stitches open or anything like that.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
