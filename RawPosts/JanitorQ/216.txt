Leon Avelino of Secret Acres and The Beguiling\u2019s Peter Birkmoe showed up but were sadly outdone by the BEST CON FACE EVER. Thank you, Toronto.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m highly amused by this, haha.)\u2013 Like I mentioned, I started using a low dose of testosterone in March.\u00a0\u00a0 Best.\u00a0 Thing.\u00a0 Ever.\u2013 My supervisor and I started to actually get along at work.\u00a0 We now work really well together (so far), whereas in the past, we have had some pretty major clashes.\u2013 I read 26 books.\u00a0 This number is way down from the past few years, but for prior to a few years ago, I wasn\u2019t reading anything at all, so it\u2019s still kinda a big deal for me!\u2013 C and I got married and went on a fun weekend getaway!\u2013 I met a new friend, a really introspective, really effeminate and handsome queer guy.\u2013 I got a new bike, but did not really ride it nearly enough.\u2013 I was in a really fun play and did a couple of drag shows.\u2013 I started this blog!There\u2019s probably more, but that was pretty much what 2013 looked like for me.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 22 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
