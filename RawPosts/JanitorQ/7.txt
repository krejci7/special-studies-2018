[last name].\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s another option, I said.\u00a0 It is in use.\u00a0 It\u2019s a thing, I tried to assure her.\u00a0 I said, \u201cIf this is representing my name, then I don\u2019t feel compelled to spell out [in a coming out email she was going to be sending on my behalf] how I am neither gender.\u00a0 The title will speak for itself, and people can ask me if they want.\u201d\u00a0 The principal nodded.\u00a0 It felt very much like we had agreed on this.\u00a0 She had told me that it could say whatever I wanted although she would like there to be some uniformity with everyone else\u2019s.\u00a0 Mx. seemed perfect.\u00a0 I assumed there was follow-through on this.As the months went by and I still didn\u2019t have a name on the door (my supervisor had ripped off my old one), I wondered what was a reasonable amount of time to wait before asking what\u2019s going on?\u00a0 But then I was out of work in May for mental health reasons.\u00a0 And then it was summer, and stuff like that doesn\u2019t get done over the summer.\u00a0 I again had a new co-worker.\u00a0 I decided I would just ride in on his coat-tails.\u00a0 It would be easier, and that was the route I preferred to take at that time.\u00a0 And sure enough, within the first couple of weeks of school starting back up in September, he got his name on the custodial door.\u00a0 And I still didn\u2019t.\u00a0 It was Mr. [last name].\u00a0 I went to the administrative assistant that day and asked about my name.\u00a0 She apologized for not adding mine to the order, and she said she\u2019d order it right then and there.\u00a0 I gave her a piece of paper where I had written it out, so there\u2019d be no confusion:\u00a0 Mx. [last name].It took 2 months, but it finally came in 2 weeks ago, but it was all wrong.\u00a0 I checked the custodial mail slot like I do most days, and I was appalled to see two new name plates:\u00a0 one for me and one for my co-worker \u2013 both of them were our first and last names.\u00a0 No titles at all.\u00a0 My ears turned red, my pulse quickened.\u00a0 I paced around a little, trying to move forward with my work while processing this.\u00a0 The principal was still in her office, adjacent to the hall where these mail slots are.\u00a0 I started to gear up to approach her, but then I hesitated, thinking I should wait until I\u2019m more levelheaded.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t get a chance to decide because right in that moment, she left.My first, more general thought was that this is disrespectful in a classist sense.\u00a0 Why should ours be the only names that don\u2019t have a title with them.\u00a0 Other thoughts spiraled out from there, most prominently, \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to deal with this!\u201dWhen the name got put on the door, I told my co-worker that\u2019s not what I wanted.\u00a0 (He failed to change out his name plate, so mine was the only one with a first name).\u00a0 I then told the administrative assistant, and she said this was the principal\u2019s decision.\u00a0 Which I already figured; I just didn\u2019t want to talk to her!\u00a0 For 5 days in a row, I gathered myself to go talk to her, only to be met with her on her way out the door right in that moment.\u00a0 So finally when passing her in the hall on the 6th day, I asked, \u201cCan I talk to you before you leave today?\u201dThat worked!\u00a0 I talked to her and it was no big deal on her end.\u00a0 I wrote out what I wanted, for a third time, and she said it\u2019d be ordered the following day.\u00a0 Which was yesterday.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see how long it takes this time around; at this point it\u2019s been over a year!\u00a0", "feedtitle": "janitorqueer"}
