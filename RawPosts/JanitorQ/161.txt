it is the mother who is standing in the way.)\u00a0 She has moved away from where she once lived and worked as a school social worker.\u00a0 She now leads a lonely existence and works as a janitor within a huge office building.There are only two or three scenes where she is depicted at her work (and it\u2019s just her coming and going.\u00a0 Loading a van, pushing a cart full of supplies).\u00a0 The story is not about that work, other than utilizing it as a plot device for somewhere she has landed and is unhappy about.\u00a0 She (understandably) yearns to get back into her chosen profession of helping people as soon as possible.\u00a0 She wants this so badly that she ends up posing as a therapist (through a series of misunderstandings) while on the job.Which brings me to a reason I loved this film\u2026\u00a0 It falls back on some unpleasant tropes common to trans characters in the media, but it ends up twisting them and rising above those ideas, to portray Maarit as a very human, very real, complex, well\u2026 person.Transperson as deceitful:\u00a0 Although Maarit deceives someone about her profession (and she quickly comes clean), she never once is attempting to deceive anyone about her transgender status.\u00a0 She is proud, self-assured, and upfront with those around her (on an as-needed basis), even in the face of speculation and slander, discrimination, and violence.Transperson as hypersexual:\u00a0 Maarit is not portrayed as a hypersexual person.\u00a0 It is clear that she is looking for intimacy, emotional connections, and a long-term partner.\u00a0 Instead, some of the characters around her are hypersexualizing her, and that seems more about them and their own issues, rather than who she actually is as a person.\u00a0 The film makes this very clear.Transperson as dangerous and/or tragic:\u00a0 Maarit is in a very difficult place (there are other aspects of her life that have fallen apart.\u00a0 I won\u2019t give away every detail!) and there are certainly scenes where she is in over her head, where she is compromised, where she seems desperate.\u00a0 It feels realistic \u2013 it very much seems that some choices she makes are due to (and only due to) being pushed so far into a corner, and she\u2019s just trying to find her way back to where she can live her life.\u00a0 Those choices are not about who she is, inherently.\u00a0 It\u2019s circumstantial.\u00a0 Some of these scenes, although hard to watch, feel triumphant at the same time.\u00a0 For example, at one point, she is attacked by an ex-lover.\u00a0 She ends up punching him in the face and ending the attack.\u00a0 Awesome.I\u2019m so glad LGBT film festivals exist \u2013 opportunities to get out there and see films I wouldn\u2019t have heard about otherwise.\u00a0 This year, I saw this one, and another trans-specific one (52 Tuesdays \u2013 sadly, I didn\u2019t enjoy this one all that much.\u00a0 It felt overly melodramatic, the characters didn\u2019t feel believable.)\u00a0 My partner and I have gone to other films over the years, and it\u2019s interesting that it always seems like there\u2019s films for men and films for women.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been to films before where we\u2019re the only ones in the theater who are not cis-men (that\u2019s an assumption, of course, but over and over again, it has been very much divided, and it is so bizarre to me.)\u00a0 At these two films (which were both well attended), there was a very diverse cross-section.\u00a0 I liked that.Also, the film festival puts out an annual literary anthology, and this year\u2019s theme was personal pronouns.\u00a0 I submitted, and my piece was accepted!\u00a0 I\u2019m now officially published, in an actual book with an ISBN # and everything!!! The piece was a re-working of these two blog posts: While I was \u201cout,\u201d part 2 \u2013 partly out of the closet, fully out of the loop While I was \u201cout,\u201d part 3 \u2013 coming back\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
