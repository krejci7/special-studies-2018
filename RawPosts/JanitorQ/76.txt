I do recognize that.\u00a0 It\u2019s not all bad.\u00a0 Every time I have the sterile pads and binder off for a little while (to let things air out), and I put on a t-shirt (carefully!), I think, \u201cThis could work!\u201d\u00a0 Excitement is there, somewhere.\u00a0 Sometimes I push down the good stuff, and remain guarded and reserved.There is something here though:\u00a0 When picking a surgeon, I wasn\u2019t going off of a whole lot.\u00a0 I mean, I pored through what was available on transbucket, for sure, and searched resources, youtube, and the like.\u00a0 But I didn\u2019t really entertain all the possibilities very much, in my head.\u00a0 I had a gut feeling about one route, and kind of just stuck with that.This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve made huge, life-changing decisions in this manner.\u00a0 But I kind of hope it might be the last time.\u00a0 (I know it won\u2019t be, haha.)\u00a0 There are better ways to go about narrowing down all the options!There is one resource that I just learned about a couple of days ago, because a fellow blogger pointed the way.\u00a0 Gabriel wrote a post called Getting Started With Top Surgery.\u00a0 He mentioned \u201ctop surgery Facebook groups where people share their results and stories with their surgeon as well as the price quotes they\u2019ve paid.\u201d\u00a0 Oh yeah!\u00a0 Facebook.\u00a0 That had not even crossed my mind, unfortunately.\u00a0 So I just joined an FTM top surgery group, and wow, this is where all the good stuff is.\u00a0 Wish I had known about it 6 months ago.Edit:\u00a0 My spouse suggested I stop looking at the FTM top surgery page for a while.\u00a0 That sounds like a good idea \u2013 I was starting to get obsessive about it.\u00a0 She said wordpress is good.\u00a0 Stop going on facebook.\u00a0 Haha.\u00a0 I agree.I feel torn about whether I will post pictures or not, and if so, where.\u00a0 Before surgery, I was sure I would not post pictures on this blog, but I would post them on transbucket, when I feel ready.\u00a0 (They can be accessed if you create an account on transbucket).\u00a0 This still sounds like what I\u2019m going to want to do.\u00a0 I do not plan on ever being shirtless in public.\u00a0 So, in regards to aesthetics, the most important thing is how everything looks while wearing a t-shirt.\u00a0 Other than people looking up pics as a resource, the only people who are going to see my chest are my spouse and me (and medical professionals, when necessary).\u00a0 So is it important what it looks like?\u00a0 Ultimately, yes.\u00a0 But for right now, as long as I can wear whatever I want, I will be happy enough\u2026During my most recent therapy appointment, right before surgery, I had said, \u201cI\u2019m worried my chest won\u2019t look as good as it does now.\u201d\u00a0 As opposed to saying, \u201cI\u2019m worried my chest won\u2019t look as good as I envision.\u201d\u00a0 That, to me, says a lot.In other news, I had a great time in Philadelphia with my mom, after my follow-up.\u00a0 We went to a brewery and record store.\u00a0 We met up with friends at the Philadelphia Trans-Health Conference and went to two workshops.\u00a0 Wish we could have stayed longer!Also, my spouse and I went to a wedding this past weekend, and it was a lot of fun!\u00a0 Their ceremony reflected who they are, a lot, and everything was casual and laid back.\u00a0 After the ceremony, I was asked to sign the marriage certificate, as one of the witnesses.\u00a0 This was a total surprise!\u00a0 I felt honored.\u00a0 I asked the officiant if it had to be my legal name, and she said it didn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 Awesome!\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
