I recently connected with Nic and Cat, a duo based in Philadelphia, who have been working super hard for about a year, creating an app for anyone who is LGBTQ+ and is looking for a health care provider. It will be simple, straightforward, user-based, and reliable.  A beta version will be available soon, and Nic says, “the more the merrier, because once we’re beta testing we want to have as many reviews on there as possible–that’s what’s gonna make the app useful.”          I already signed up.  You can too!  At:  https://qspacesapp.com/qreview/I definitely will have a lot to add, from The first primary care doctor who proscribed me T, The terrible consultation I had for top surgery in my area, and, yeah, there will be much more.  I have thoughts on my current doctor.  Thoughts about the surgeon who did do my top surgery.  Thoughts about my sometimes therapist and my psychiatrist (refreshingly, those two are all positive.)I asked Nic a few questions to get a better sense of who they are and what their project is all about…K:  I’m curious, do you and Cat have experience in web design?  Or, what are your backgrounds?K:  Was there a specific moment or incident where you said, “We need an app to fill in this void of information.”
