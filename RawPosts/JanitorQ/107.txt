Dylan, a 5 year old child who strongly feels he is a girl, and his parents. Hal, a 9 year old FTM trans-person, and his parents.Kaden\u2019s story focused on how horrific it was to start puberty, his social transition, and how hard it\u2019s been for his mom, although she is supportive.\u00a0 His mom talked about him being able to take further steps, (hormones and surgery), when he\u2019s 18.\u00a0 I found this video and article on Huffington Post \u2013 a Where Are They Now from 2013, where Kaden is 20.\u00a0 He ended up getting to start testosterone at age 14 and get top surgery at 16.\u00a0 He seems happy.Dylan\u2019s story focused on the tension between the parents and between Dylan and his dad.\u00a0 His mom is fine with his son\u2019s preferences and who he might turn out to be.\u00a0 She will buy him dolls and engage in discussions about how he feels he is a girl.\u00a0 His dad does not approve, and there is already a big rift in his relationship with his son.\u00a0 The parents fight about it.\u00a0 The dad stated, \u201cI discipline him.\u201d\u00a0 Things seemed skewed in a way in which the dad was demonized.\u00a0 Dylan was not on the show, but he was shown backstage, happily coloring.Next, a gender therapist talked about the best practices in how to handle a child going through this.\u00a0 To just be there for the child and love them no matter what.\u00a0 And it might be a phase; it might not \u2013 and that\u2019s OK.\u00a0 She claimed that about 1/3 of children grow out of it, 1/3 grow up to be gay, and 1/3 grow up to be trans.\u00a0 I wonder if these statistics hold up?Hal\u2019s story focused on how open and accepting his parents were, after he verbalized suicidal ideation at 6 years old.\u00a0 His parents claimed that Hal can make his own choices about his path, when he is ready.\u00a0 They talked about difficult moments, and Hal was kind of put on the spot.\u00a0 At 9 years old, I think he was too young to be on the show, talking about his story.\u00a0 He was crying through it.\u00a0 That was hard to watch.Lastly, a MTF trans-adult came on the air to talk about her life path and how much easier it could have been if she had been able to transition at a younger age.\u00a0 Instead, her doctors were suggesting a lobotomy, and her family was seriously considering it.\u00a0 Luckily they didn\u2019t go through with it, and she grew up as male, had a family (is now divorced but it seems amicable) and is living more authentically now.This show touched ever so briefly on heavy issues, but shied away each time.\u00a0 Hate crimes were brought up.\u00a0 Homelessness.\u00a0 Suicide rates.\u00a0 Racism.\u00a0 Class issues amongst the families could have been explored.\u00a0 Oprah tends to focus on the positives, which is definitely doing a disservice.\u00a0 But in terms of talking about what kids need, she directed the conversations in the right directions.The show closed with Dylan\u2019s dad proclaiming that he is now going to go buy his son some dolls when he leaves.\u00a0 When Oprah asked why, he said, \u201cLife is more important.\u201dStay tuned for part 3: A&E The Transgender Revolution from 1998.\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
