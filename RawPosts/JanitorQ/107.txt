I used to work as a business coach but I now plan to make a living through these videos somehow. On the short term I will probably have to get by on donations and funds, on the medium to long term, I plan to have books, events and workshops to sell.What\u2019s perhaps also good to know is that I\u2019m not just doing this for myself and my own personal growth as a human being. I ultimately wish to inspire as many people as possible. To show that we\u2019re\u00a0all\u00a0human beings, no matter what we look like, where we\u2019re from or what we do. We all love and fear. We all have hopes and dreams. And we all sometimes struggle with relationships, money, confidence and loneliness. Personally, I\u2019ve learned that the moment you realise this is the moment you can empathise with another person and because of that build a meaningful relationship. And that\u2019s what I would like to see more of in the world!\u201dJQ:\u00a0 How did you get into this project?\u00a0 What inspired you?LC:\u00a0 I\u2019ve spent about 12 years in the business world (amongst other things as a business consultant and startup cofounder) but I\u2019ve always had a keen interest in the more human side of life.\u00a0 This expressed itself through teaching yoga, doing lots of personal development training courses and coaches and being overall very reflective of myself and life in general.\u00a0 Though this question popped up in my head a few years ago, it was in May of this year that I realised that it was this human side that I wanted to explore more at this point in my life and I made a spontaneous decision to ask the question \u2018how is it to be you?\u2019 to all sorts of people around the world (hence renting out my house and traveling) and document it through blogs and video.JQ:\u00a0 Is this video part of a larger series, or does it stand on its own?LC:\u00a0 This video is the first of a much larger series. There will be supershort videos on Facebook (where I randomly ask people in the street this question), these 3 minute videos (the next one will be about a banker turned hand made paper maker in the Czech countryside) and ultimately a book, a long documentary and live events. Concerning the video of Miss Tobi, it\u2019s very likely that I\u2019ll also make an 8 minute version that will be sent into several festivals.JQ:\u00a0 How did you meet Miss Tobi?\u00a0 What came first, meeting her, or the idea for the video?
