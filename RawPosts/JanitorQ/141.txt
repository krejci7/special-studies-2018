reasons.\u00a0 Although this was a very trying time and I was in an extremely vulnerable head-space, I was mostly treated with respect and dignity (as much as seemed possible, given the conditions).\u00a0 In terms of my trans-status, I was treated with respect and dignity across the board.While in the Emergency / Admittance Area, my family and friends present must have spoken behind-the-scenes, on my behalf about the fact that I am transgender, because I didn\u2019t mention it at all at that point.\u00a0 My friend later told me the intake leader (don\u2019t know his exact title) told her that he has a transgender son.Also my partner later told me there was signage throughout the hospital about their non-discrimination policies.\u00a0 I found this to be accurate in the way they run things.\u00a0 Everything was by schedule and protocol, no special treatment and in general no immediate response to a want (like, \u201ccan I get a pencil?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cCan I get a snack\u201d elicited a quicker response.)\u00a0 At times, I found the ways they were doing things to be confusing, and I wasn\u2019t explicitly told how things are run (when mealtimes are, when med times are, what is allowed and not allowed, etc.)\u00a0 I just picked up that information as I went along, as best I could.\u00a0 Not sure why that kind of stuff was never conveyed to me, but it all did make sense in terms of treating everyone fairly.I got the sense that not every staff member got the memo about male pronouns, but the more \u201cimportant\u201d positions definitely did, and they took the lead on that when conversing with other staff members.\u00a0 For example, one of the team leaders asked an overnight staff person to \u201copen the shower area for him,\u201d and that staff member said, \u201cWhat?\u201d and looked confused.\u00a0 The team leader just repeated herself and no problem arose.I was in an extremely fuzzy, drug induced state the first 24 hours of my stay.\u00a0 As I started to pull out of that and notice my surroundings, I picked up on certain things.\u00a0 If you woke up early enough to make it to the morning meeting at 8am, you could get non-decaffeinated coffee and also information about the day!\u00a0 I was surprised how few people came to the meeting (it felt like one of the highlights of each day.)On the first day I was capable of making it to the meeting, I was still very much in my head and not at all with it.\u00a0 An out-of-character-for-me event happened.\u00a0 I interrupted the team leader 1 minute into the meeting.\u00a0 I stood up and went to the front of the room.\u00a0 I said I\u2019m new here and introduced myself.\u00a0 I said I\u2019m transgender and could everyone use male pronouns?\u00a0 (If only all comings-out could be this easy!!!!!\u00a0 I feel really proud of myself for this one.)\u00a0 Another patient asked excitedly, \u201cWhat\u2019s transgender?\u00a0 That means you were born a girl, right?\u201d\u00a0 He seemed ready to continue conversing at length, but another staff member made attempts to derail him and get the meeting back on track, which worked immediately.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t done with my spiel yet though.\u00a0 I concluded with, \u201cAnd there are no knives allowed \u2013 I heard that early on!\u201d before sitting back down.I also chatted with another patient about my transgender identity at one point.The first day I was there, I did not have access to Androgel, but that seemed part of protocol \u2013 it takes time to clear personal belongings including prescriptions, maybe?\u00a0 I did not yet have my street clothes or reading material or slippers either.\u00a0 The second day, the nurse brought my Androgel and seemingly played dumb with how to apply it and how much.\u00a0 I told her I apply 1-2 pumps daily (I apply 1 pump, but my prescription states 1-2 pumps).\u00a0 I told her it\u2019s supposed to be applied to your upper arms, but I do my thighs.\u00a0 I told her I have to go into my bathroom (in private) to apply the gel, and she waited for me.\u00a0 The other times she came with it, she referred to it as a spray and also as a patch.\u00a0 She was vague about my dosing.\u00a0 She let me do my thing and then hand it back to her.\u00a0 Although this all felt confusing, I think it was an attempt to convey, \u201cthis is your thing and we trust that you will take care of it.\u00a0 We don\u2019t care what you are doing in this regard.\u201d\u00a0 It felt validating.Although the hospital was far from a pleasant experience, and I would say there were a couple of instances while I was in the emergency department in which I was treated as less than a person with dignity, in terms of my trans-status, they got it right, every step of the way.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
