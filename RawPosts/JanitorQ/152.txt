I too struggle with depression and am on medication for it. I have been trying to find information on it but, were you on antidepressants when you started T and if so, did it affect how the T was processed? I am curious if the T counteracts negatively in any way with depression meds. Thank you for your posts and i look forward to hearing from you!And since I don\u2019t have any direct experience with this, I thought I\u2019d post here and see if others might have some helpful thoughts / advice.I was on antidepressants for around 6 years, from 2000-2006.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t start testosterone till 2013, so I\u2019m very far from there having been any overlap.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t heard of someone having an adverse reaction to being on both at the same time, or there being any issue with how the T is being processed by the body.\u00a0 Everything is an adjustment though, and T is a potent hormone to throw into the mix.For me, T has acted as a pretty effective anti-anxiety substance and antidepressant.\u00a0 I would recommend it to anyone who is depressed or anxious (That\u2019s a joke.\u00a0 Kinda, haha.)I don\u2019t know whether I would ever take a synthesized antidepressant medication again.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been on quite a few, and they were all either not really doing much of anything, or they were flattening me out into a walking zombie.\u00a0 They definitely do work wonders for some people though.\u00a0 Testosterone has been much more effective, for me, and I don\u2019t just mean in terms of addressing body dysphoria.\u00a0 I mean that it has lifted me into a new level of living, basically.\u00a0 I wanna say that it\u2019s been taking testosterone + being in therapy simultaneously that\u2019s gotten me here (a powerful combination.)I definitely am prone to low moods still.\u00a0 Just this past week / weekend is a very clear, recent example.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t sleeping well, my appetite was poor, I was obsessing about things I can\u2019t change, I had little motivation for anything beyond basic functioning level.\u00a0 But something is very different about these dips than where I used to be at:\u00a0 I know they are not going to last.\u00a0 I know I\u2019ll be naturally coming out of it at any point, and once I do, I don\u2019t need to live in constant fear of the next time I start to feel low.\u00a0 Because, that\u2019s all it is \u2013 feeling low.\u00a0 It\u2019s no longer body + soul crushing depression, which I\u2019ve been all too familiar with for most of my teenaged years and young adulthood\u2026Has anyone been on antidepressants when they started testosterone?\u00a0 Did you notice anything about how the two substances might have possibly interacted with each other?\u00a0 What has been your experience with antidepressants?\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 16 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
