Doing math.Later on in the movie, Will is talking with his therapist, Sean, about careers.\u00a0 (I\u2019m condensing the dialogue a little, for efficiency.)I could be reading too much into it, but\u00a0 the tone of the therapist\u2019s voice, while delivering that last part, is complete, total snark (his character plays up the snark quite a bit though \u2013 to match Will\u2019s tone.)\u00a0 Basically saying, \u201cjust keep sticking to what\u2019s \u2018honorable,\u2019 and see how far you get.\u201dSometimes, I too talk with my therapist about being a janitor.\u00a0 She has said, \u201cyou are probably the smartest janitor.\u201d\u00a0 She must not have caught Good Will Hunting, haha.\u00a0 I\u2019ve conveyed that sometimes I find it totally absurd that this is my job.\u00a0 (I may not be a bad-ass boy genius, but still, in a lot of ways, \u201cjanitor\u201d is a strange fit for me.)In spite of this, I can easily see myself retiring from this job.\u00a0 (Retirement at age 55, here I come!)\u00a0 There is absolutely no \u201ccareer\u201d I can envision pursuing (I\u2019ve always felt this way.\u00a0 Maybe that will change with time; I won\u2019t hold my breath.)\u00a0 I mean, I envision pursuing lots of other endeavors \u2013 writing, radio DJ-ing, volunteering in myriad ways, but \u201cjanitor\u201d seems as good a way as any to actually make money\u2026\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
