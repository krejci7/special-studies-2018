And from 7 months ago, just simply, I need to get a new doctorAt the appointment, we first discussed the fact that I went to the eye doctor, and that my vitamin D is low and I need to get supplements, and then finally discussed the reasons I\u2019m there.\u00a0 She said she did find two area specialists (one is an LGBTQ health center I\u2019d rather not go through, and the other is an endocrinologist who focuses on adult health \u2013 good to know there is someone local, and that she uncovered him!)\u00a0 She continued to tell me she does not think it\u2019s necessary for me to go through either of these channels unless I want to, and that she will continue seeing me for low-dose testosterone therapy.\u00a0 I was super happy but didn\u2019t really let on.\u00a0 I did tell her I am glad I can keep coming to see her though.\u00a0 And that I don\u2019t feel like I need to go to these other people unless something comes up.I wonder what happened within that 3 month time span!\u00a0 I think she did some research.\u00a0 Or, in the process of reaching out to specialists, they conveyed to her that it was within her realm and abilities.\u00a0 And then she did some research.\u00a0 Something!We discussed the labs I got done in May.\u00a0 My T levels were at 68 ng/dl.\u00a0 This surprised me quite a bit \u2013 previously, I was at 102 ng/dl.\u00a0 I had somehow, without changing a thing, dipped back into a normal female range.\u00a0 How does that work?I know I should go by how I\u2019m feeling, and not by numbers.\u00a0 BUT \u2013 is it just a coincidence that I increased my testosterone dosage 2 months ago, just kinda because?\u00a0 Because I felt like it?\u00a0 Hmmm.\u00a0 I\u2019m super curious to know what my levels are now, accounting for the slight increase\u2026\u00a0 I\u2019ll find out in 3 more months\u2026 (More labs.)Until then, I just wanna revel in the fact that I finally have a primary care physician I would feel comfortable going to for any issue that comes up with my body, trans-related or not.\u00a0 This is a first!\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
