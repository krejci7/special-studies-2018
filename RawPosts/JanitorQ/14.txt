\u00a0Anyway, at that time, I was sooooooo relieved. \u00a0It was a visceral feeling. \u00a0All the negativity was left up on the second floor, and although I was still struggling, I fit right back into the first floor. \u00a0A few months later, I got on a medication that really started working for me, and the next two years went really well for the most part.Sometimes a little too well: \u00a0As I\u2019ve mentioned before, I went through a manic episode in May, and I was out for two months, recovering from that. \u00a0In a good way though \u2013 so far so good on the avoidance of a rebound depression. \u00a0However, I lost my status at work. \u00a0When I got back, it was clear that the new guy was now the new second-in-command.In the past, this would have felt devastating, and I would have clung onto whatever control I did have, to the detriment of myself, only, really. \u00a0I know because I\u2019d already put myself through all that, big time. \u00a0This time around, I decided to take it all in stride, as best I could. \u00a0Instead of arguing about how I couldn\u2019t do the second floor or anything like that, I spent time \u201cstaking it out,\u201d I guess you could say? \u00a0Just, spending time up there visualizing this or that and getting accustomed to the idea, before kids came back.Now that school is back in session, I am IN IT. \u00a0And it\u2019s not actually bad. \u00a0So far it has felt preferable, in fact. \u00a0I\u2019ve made some changes to my routine that really feel like they\u2019re making a difference. \u00a0Instead of bringing my cart plus mop bucket plus garbage barrel to each and every classroom, I am \u201csweeping through,\u201d first with the garbage and rags to wipe everything down, then with the vacuum for all the area rugs, and then with the dust mop. \u00a0I am taking WAY more steps going through multiple times instead of going room-by-room, but it\u2019s feeling good. \u00a0Feeling faster, even.And the weather has not been too hot. \u00a0And there\u2019s a new drinking fountain up there as of a couple months ago \u2013 the kind where you can easily fill up a water bottle from, and it says how many plastic bottles you are saving by doing so. \u00a0I love it! \u00a0And I like the fact that the teachers clear out early up there, for the most part. \u00a0And the rooms have been clean thus-far.Best of all, I have my own \u201croom\u201d to store stuff, up there. \u00a0That\u2019s new. \u00a0So while things are kinda turbulent with co-worker dynamics, I am so glad to have all my stuff and activities separate from theirs, more-so than ever before.All the negative associations I\u2019ve held about the second floor have pretty much melted away. \u00a0A lot of that has to do with mental health and coming out at work. \u00a0I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m trying so hard to get in and out of places. \u00a0I actually feel like I belong. \u00a0When I talk with people, I like my voice. \u00a0When I walk and do all this physical work, more muscle mass is making it feel much more effortless.The only thing I\u2019m dreading now is \u201cgym use.\u201d \u00a0Coming soon will be screaming children using the gym for their cheer-leading practice, from 6-8:30pm. \u00a0And once that\u2019s over, it\u2019ll be basketball all winter-long. \u00a0We\u2019ll see how well I can adjust\u2026\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
