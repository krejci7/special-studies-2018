That specific trauma is still thereThis year, although I\u2019m acknowledging the anniversary, it feels like just the slightest emotional blip on my radar.\u00a0 I talked about it in therapy yesterday.\u00a0 I finally got my hospital records back from my therapist (she had been holding onto them for me for a whole year!)\u00a0 I looked through them again last night \u2013 there was always one page I skipped over.\u00a0 It was handwritten by me, explaining what had been going on in my social life that led me to feel like I needed to be hospitalized.\u00a0 I read it and felt OK about it.Although this seems counter-intuitive, I think it helps that I was hospitalized in January.\u00a0 Where everything went wrong the first time around, everything went right(?) (maybe not right, but it went smoothly) this time around.\u00a0 I can overlay this experience on top of my shitty traumatic experience, and things make more sense.I resisted the diagnosis of bipolar disorder for a long time,\u00a0 I\u2019d been off all meds for 9 years; I felt relatively stable.\u00a0 When it was re-affirmed that I have bipolar disorder by the psychiatrist I was assigned, (\u201cOnce a bipolar, always a bipolar.\u201d) I bristled at that.\u00a0 Actually, I bristled at him in general every step of the way.\u00a0 Appointments with him lasted a mere 2 minutes.\u00a0 He was inflexible and adamant I stay on meds forever.\u00a0 He forgot pertinent information about me.\u00a0 (At one point he told me I needed to stay on meds because I had been hearing voices.)\u00a0 After 6 months, I just stopped making appointments with him.\u00a0 With all his intensity toward me staying on meds, it was surprising how easily he let me just get away.\u00a0 Maybe he didn\u2019t even notice I left.My therapist helped me find a new psychiatrist; she\u2019s awesome!\u00a0 She\u2019s willing to follow my lead on what I want to do about drugs, and she\u2019s willing to dialogue with me instead of ordering me what to do.\u00a0 I still don\u2019t know what to do about drugs, but at least I have the space to feel supported with whatever I do choose to do.\u00a0 For now, I\u2019m staying on them, but I can\u2019t pinpoint why.I respect this new psychiatrist.\u00a0 When she (also) told me I fit the criteria for bipolar type I, for the first time in a very long time, I felt like I could accept that.\u00a0 I don\u2019t need to incorporate that in any particular way into my identity; it doesn\u2019t need to mean I view myself differently.\u00a0 Personally, it\u2019s not a core part of who I am.\u00a0 It just is an aspect of me that can just be, and I can leave it at that.And I can finally integrate the difficult journey toward mental health as parts of myself, rather than things that happened to me.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
