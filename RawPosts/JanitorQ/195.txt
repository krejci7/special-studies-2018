Part 2 is about feeling disconnected from the LGBT community.This is more about how I\u2019m finding my way back.\u00a0 How was I involved in the LGBT community before it started feeling overwhelming?\u00a0 Mostly, I was connecting on personal levels with people, whether that was through a group (for example, I was in a gender identity group therapy dynamic from 2004-2006), at conferences (I went to a handful between 2004 and 2006), or just hanging out one-on-one and talking about difficult stuff.\u00a0 I did an AIDS walk, I volunteered for the local LGBT film festival, things like that.In my late-teens / early-twenties, I would say I was only partly out of the closet, while being very involved in the community, because I was not specifically hiding anything, but I wasn\u2019t vocal in the least, either.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy to not really talk about who you are when you rarely talk at all to begin with.\u00a0 And this, specifically, is what I\u2019ve been working on, because my ultimate goal is to feel comfortable as a social person.\u00a0 I don\u2019t talk much at all, on a daily basis.\u00a0 I have a handful of people who I talk to a lot, (just ask my partner!) and beyond that, I don\u2019t talk to people \u2013 not about the weather, not about myself, not about local news, etc.\u00a0 I am slowly, slowly, trying to change this.So when I say I want to come out, what I mean is that I want to be comfortable talking to any and everyone, to varying degrees, about my life, about what I\u2019m doing, and about my take on who I am.\u00a0 I\u2019m a pro at hearing all about this stuff from everyone else, but I have a ways to go.\u00a0 I want to stop filtering.\u00a0 I want to be able to just casually say, \u201cMy partner and I did _____ this weekend.\u201d\u00a0 And actually use her name and her pronouns.\u00a0 In more advanced situations, I want to include more about my gender identity.\u00a0 I started to come out to some family members recently, but there\u2019s a whole lot more to do.All along, there\u2019s been one way I\u2019ve always been \u201cout,\u201d and that\u2019s been through my appearance.\u00a0 I never compromise on that; not while growing up (and I was fortunate to have parents who didn\u2019t meddle too much), and certainly not now.\u00a0 I appear how I want to appear.\u00a0 I wear what I want to wear.\u00a0 And people can come to assumptions easily based on that.\u00a0 The assumptions are probably pretty far off from how I actually identify, but I can live with that.\u00a0 It\u2019s much better than feeling uncomfortable with how I look.\u00a0 In retrospect, I think that the fact I\u2019ve been so uncomfortable in my body is the reason why I\u2019ve always given myself a lot of leeway on the things I can control:\u00a0 clothing, shoes, accessories, hairstyles.\u00a0 Essentially:\u00a0 gender presentation.\u00a0 I have rarely cared what others think, in terms of the way I look.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve been fortunate to have never gotten too much flak about it (or, perhaps, I\u2019ve been oblivious\u2026)Why do I want to come back to the LGBT (specifically the T) community?\u00a0 Some of the reasons are selfish.\u00a0 I started testosterone, and the community now feels more relevant to my life again.\u00a0 But another way to phrase that exact same notion would be, \u201cI\u2019ve finally found where I belong, in a positive way, and it\u2019s within the trans* community.\u00a0 Now that I\u2019ve gotten through the bulk of the personal struggles, I want to give back.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure how, exactly, yet, but some pretty safe bets would be:\u2013 through writing \u2013 through connecting personally with others \u2013 through local community involvement -And specifically, one day, I\u2019d like to present at conferences and/or be a gender identity youth coordinator.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see\u2026\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
