for me personally though, I embrace \u201cpassing.\u201d\u00a0 I relish the times I pass as male because although I don\u2019t feel myself to be male, exactly, it feels awesome and validating when that\u2019s what others see.\u00a0 If this were to happen 100% of the time or even 18% of the time, it\u2019d start to feel disorienting, alarming even.\u00a0 But when it happens on occasion, it\u2019s one of my favorite things ever!It happened three times in the past two weeks.\u00a0 And, it was not only thrilling, but totally unexpected and unprecedented.\u00a0 Because in the past, I\u2019ve passed at a distance, or with kids, or maybe with people who are much much older than me, or I pass until I start speaking, etc.\u00a0 But two out of three of these recent occasions, I was fully interacting with someone roughly my age (meaning:\u00a0 making eye contact, conversing, spending more than a couple seconds in their presence).\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure if this has ever happened to me before, or if it has, it\u2019s been a long time.Makes me think that testosterone is doing something very subtly, above and beyond appearance.\u00a0 Like an aura or an energy or something that can be sensed by others.\u00a0 Because I look the same as I always have; I sound the same.\u00a0 The only thing I can think is that my shoulders might be slightly more filled out now; I might have a little bit of a different stance because of that.\u00a0 Ultimately, if it\u2019s an either/or, in my opinion, I think I look female, and I love it when people think otherwise!At Work:\u00a0 It was spring break, so the building was almost empty except for my co-workers and me.\u00a0 We were eating lunch, and my co-worker saw through the window that UPS had just pulled up, so I went down to receive and sign for the packages (usually administrative assistants would do that.)\u00a0 I let him into the office, talked to him about how everyone\u2019s on vacation, small talk like that, etc.\u00a0 I signed his form, and he said, \u201cThank you, sir!.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\u00a0 And walked away, beaming.At The Mall:\u00a0 My partner and I never go to the mall.\u00a0 Seriously.\u00a0 We have been together for 7 years and have been to a mall together once before, in that time.\u00a0 (Oh wait, no, twice.\u00a0 We went mini-golfing in a mall for a friend\u2019s birthday.)\u00a0 In addition, I have been to a mall one time by myself in that time.\u00a0 We really had to go to the Apple store though because she finally upgraded to a smart phone, and then proceeded to smash the screen by dropping it on a concrete floor.\u00a0 Her protective case was on its way, in the mail!\u00a0 So we were just going to go there and see if they could do anything for her \u2013 a long shot, but might as well try\u2026\u00a0 They could not do a single thing for her but they were very nice about it, as if they were her good buddy and just could not let her down, haha.\u00a0 We then walked out of the Apple Store and were directly confronted by a kiosk selling phone cases and a sign saying, \u201cWe fix phones here.\u201d\u00a0 She asked, \u201chow much?\u201d\u00a0 It was reasonable and was only going to take 20 minutes.\u00a0 Seemed like a good option, so we watched the guy work his magic with teeny tiny screwdrivers with magnetic tips.\u00a0 He talked to us about how he\u2019s only 22 years old and he already owns 10 of these kiosks.\u00a0 He\u2019d just gotten back from Miami Beach for a entrepreneur conference, and he was on his way to Seattle.\u00a0 We chatted with him about phones, what there is to do for fun here, etc.\u00a0 I left to go find a bathroom and come right back.\u00a0 Then I left to sample teas at Teavana and come right back.\u00a0 Then I wandered away into a clothing store.\u00a0 My partner got her screen replaced(!!!) and when she came to get me, she told me that while I was gone, the kiosk guy asked her if I was her boyfriend!\u00a0 She told him \u201cYes.\u201dAt the Public Market:\u00a0 I was looking at mushrooms when a little girl (3 years old?) turned and almost hugged my leg, thinking I was her mother.\u00a0 When she realized I wasn\u2019t she startled, and then asked, \u201cIs you a goioiol?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIs you a goioiol?\u201d\u00a0 I squatted down to her height and clarified her question, \u201cAm I a boy or girl?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m a little bit of both.\u201d\u00a0 She seemed to accept this.Other recent instances in which I passed:\u2013 Effeminate pirate orders fruity drink on party boat \u2013 Passing as a teenager yet again \u2013 Thirty-one year old kid working as school janitor\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
