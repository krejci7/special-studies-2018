(I didn\u2019t actually use this phrase.) \u00a0She implied that sure, that could help.At this point, I took a step back and thought about\u00a0what\u2019s happening. \u00a0So far, the endo got a referral from my PCP, and that didn\u2019t include any history of care: \u00a0just Female to Male transgender person (F64.1), chronic. \u00a0In addition, they got information from a psychiatrist that I am bipolar, that I have been seeing her for 9 months, and that I\u2019ve been stable during that time (relatively, this is such a short amount of time; it\u2019s kind of implying that the rest of my \u201cbipolar disorder\u201d time is a wildcard.) \u00a0I don\u2019t want to get too\u00a0paranoid, but this collection of information is not working for me at all. \u00a0That plus the fact that\u00a0it\u2019s straight up inaccurate.Feeling like the system is working against me, I decided to pull from my bag of tricks and email my therapist. \u00a0If there\u2019s anything that could help this stalemate, it\u2019d be her. \u00a0I relayed this whole series of events and asked her if she could also write a referral, actually filling in the background information. \u00a0She replied in 10 MINUTES \u2013 such a refreshing change! and said crazy that this is so hard, and sure she\u2019d write a letter, and is there anything else I\u2019d want to make sure she includes?So she\u2019s writing a letter. \u00a0My intent is, essentially, that this is not a new diagnosis, coming out of nowhere. \u00a0That I\u2019ve already been on T in the past, I\u2019ve had top surgery, I\u2019m in the process of legally changing my name, etc. \u00a0So, this should be a continuation of ongoing care (timely, please!). \u00a0I\u2019m not starting from square one here. \u00a0I imagine this endo has access of my medical records (?? not sure how that works), so if she looked into it, she\u2019d find this stuff. \u00a0I\u2019m just having my therapist bring it to the forefront, which will hopefully change\u00a0something?Because, I feel like if it went the other way \u2013 my doctor sending the referral first on my behalf, instead of me going backwards to get this stuff covered, I would have been given an appointment within a more reasonable window. \u00a0Not sure if that\u2019d be true or not \u2013 there could be dozens of reasons outside of my control \u2013 maybe she\u2019s just really busy. \u00a0But, I gotta try\u2026Blah.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
