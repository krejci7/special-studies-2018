Next we watched an Oprah show about transgender kids, from 2004.\u00a0 It was surprisingly well done.Part 3 was a program on A&E from 1998 called, \u201cThe Transgender Revolution.\u201dAs soon as we started watching it, my partner said she remembered seeing it in a class at College \u2013 that\u2019s pretty cool.\u00a0 And her reaction was positive, like it had been worthwhile.\u00a0 And it was \u2013 it showcased a few trans-people in respectful and dignified ways.\u00a0 It was also the most political, by far.\u00a0 There was a clip of Leslie Feinberg, and there was footage of Riki Wilchins talking about hate crimes and founding Gender PAC.\u00a0 She talked about going to senators to get policies changed, and going to the APA to get \u201cGender Identity Disorder\u201d changed.\u00a0 Brandon Teena was talked about, as well as two more recent cases of the murders of trans-women.The first portrait focused on Tonye, from Tampa, FL.\u00a0 He lives on a farm, works as a sheriff, has a wife and 8 year old daughter.\u00a0 He talks about all the discrimination he has been up against at his job.\u00a0 He also says his community has been hostile \u2013 his farm animals have been killed; other times they have been turned loose.\u00a0 He started an online group called TOPS \u2013 Trans Officers Protect and Serve, in order to get support for people like him.\u00a0 He had to undergo an internal confidential criminal investigation at his job, which he says is just a pretext for prejudice.\u00a0 It was left on an uncertain note \u2013 we don\u2019t know the outcome of his struggles at work.Next the program focused on Nancy Nangeroni, an engineer from MA.\u00a0 She talked a lot about overcompensating and living as a very macho guy, taking a lot of risks.\u00a0 The turning point for her was when she endured horrible injuries from a motorcycle accident \u2013 she realized she could not keep living the way she had been.\u00a0 One great quote from her:\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m not a pre-op or a post-op because that\u2019s not what defines me as a person.\u201d\u00a0 She founded the IFGE \u2013 International Foundation of Gender Education.The third portrait was really moving because it was done anonymously.\u00a0 \u201cTerry\u201d never showed his face, and neither did his wife and his mother.\u00a0 He owns a construction company and lives completely stealth.\u00a0 He equated being trans to having cancer \u2013 it\u2019s something that you live with, and getting treatment is a matter of life and death.\u00a0 His story focused on him getting metoidioplasty.\u00a0 It was made clear that he needed this procedure to be legally recognized as male \u2013 he was living in fear of being outed because his documents all had an \u201cF\u201d on them.The program wrapped up by discussing the extremes of gender in the society we live in.\u00a0 Toys, etc.\u00a0 \u201cIn time, the movement may leave America forever changed.\u201d\u00a0 A nice note to end on.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
