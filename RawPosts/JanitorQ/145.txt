And the big thing I\u2019m finally getting around to:\u00a0 I am cleaning my room.*My room has been a disaster area for mostly my entire life.\u00a0 I mean, I guess there were periods of time where I kept things organized throughout my childhood, but largely, it\u2019s a watch-where-you-step zone.\u00a0 There is a method to the madness, but it doesn\u2019t work all that well, and there have been times recently where I can\u2019t find something.\u00a0 I have a tendency to not unpack bags and also a tendency to not want to touch things because they have sentimental value and are buried somewhere down there.\u00a0 It\u2019s like an archaeological dig.\u00a0 This room has not been cleaned in probably 2 years \u2013 lots of dust and hair and just grossnesses.\u00a0 At least no food or stuff like that \u2013 I\u2019m good about that.I guess I have a confession:\u00a0 I am a janitor who is a messy person at heart.Really only a partial view. Need a panorama for this mess!Almost done with this blanket!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have a fair amount of anxiety about returning to work next week.\u00a0 I have never been out of work for this long, ever.\u00a0 People might be asking me questions that I need to be prepared to field.\u00a0 Although it may be tough to believe in my line of work, I was temporarily experiencing quite a lot of stress, and many changes were under way, leading up to being out of work.\u00a0 I think I can manage it better once I get back, but I won\u2019t really know until I\u2019m in it.\u00a0 Either way, I know I\u2019ll be ready to go back \u2013 only so much I can do with huge swaths of unstructured time.\u00a0 (I\u2019ve also been playing thought experiments about how hard would it be to come out as non-binary at work?\u00a0 Everyone really likes me there \u2013 I think they could get on board.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see\u2026)*When I say \u201cmy room,\u201d I\u2019m referring to the room where my partner and I sleep, and where I store a lot of my personal belongings in big disheveled swirls.\u00a0 We don\u2019t hang out in there or watch TV or anything because it\u2019s not all that aesthetically pleasing, at least for my partner.\u00a0 Also, it is the attic of our house, so it is very cold in the winter.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
