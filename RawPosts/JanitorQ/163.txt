Again, not actual school/teacher/kids, but a good representation.I like this feeling a lot.\u00a0 It helps me feel more like the way I see myself.\u00a0 The only tough thing about it is when I get a glimpse of myself in the mirror (this happens at home too, it\u2019s not just a work thing) and I realize how tiny and feminine I actually am!\u00a0 I seem to especially hone in on my neck, for whatever reason \u2013 it\u2019s so dainty and slender and like it could snap right in half so easily.\u00a0 My wrists too; it feels like my hands could snap off at any time.\u00a0 These feelings don\u2019t really translate into me feeling like I should be taking more testosterone and becoming more masculine.\u00a0 They\u2019re just sorta\u2026 fleeting, at least for the time being.Another thing that\u2019s going on at work that\u2019s somewhat related is:\u00a0 age.\u00a0 The kids stay the same; the parents stay the same.\u00a0 (Not really of course.\u00a0 Kids grow up.\u00a0 I just mean I\u2019m perpetually surrounded by kids and parents around the same ages, they cycle through, while I get older and older.)\u00a0 I used to be the youngest person who worked at the school, for years.\u00a0 Now, there\u2019s a teacher who is younger than me. When did that happen?!\u00a0 (It happened last year.)\u00a0 Also, parents keep looking younger and younger.\u00a0 Many of them are, in fact, younger than me now, which is a shift.\u00a0 In fact, just yesterday, a parent recognized me from high school.\u00a0 She was in a grade below me.\u00a0 It was super weird!It\u2019s just not the same as it used to be:\u00a0 kids and parents these days!\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
