FROM 5/15/04: I was just wanting something intense to happen. Just by myself, here at the apartment. In addition, I have been obsessing about the removal of my breasts again. There was quite a while when I was ok with them, but I\u2019m not anymore. So I had to pretend like I was going to cut them off. I used that knife and dragged it in sections to form a circle around both. Not deep. It hurt. No blood, but it\u2019ll leave red marks. Like 2 bull\u2019s-eyes. I kind of liked it, but now I look at them and what I did is fucking scary. No emotions to match these actions. Now though, I don\u2019t act out toward my breasts or dwell on the fact that they\u2019re there. It\u2019s sort of like I don\u2019t really know them. Although sometimes I squeeze my nipples because it feels good, no one else can touch me anywhere near there, or oftentimes, anywhere on my skin at all.\u00a0\u00a0That chest is not a part of me. I got my first tattoo this past fall.\u00a0 The image is a\u00a0scratchy line drawing, a symbol I came up with to express my connection to\u00a0a deconstructed gender identity.\u00a0 It\u2019s on my chest, below my right\u00a0clavicle \u2013 to the right of my sternum.\u00a0 I thought a lot beforehand, while thinking about placement, about whether to incorporate some pretty prominent scars\u2026 whether to see if the tattoo could hide them\u2026 whether to accentuate the scar lines with the tattoo\u2026\u00a0 In the end, I wore a tank top that would hide the scars from the tattoo artist, and had the tattoo placed near them but not with them.\u00a0 Too much shame still surrounds them; they are too personal.\u00a0 The experience itself was exhilarating and euphoric; I was zoning, reaching a blissed-out state.\u00a0 And also pushing thoughts of self-mutilation from my mind with every pulse of the tattoo machine.\u00a0 Hours later, I was out to dinner with my person (who had also gotten a tattoo that afternoon), and emotions unexpectedly flooded in.\u00a0 Tearing up and unable to dissociate from the parallels\u00a0between cutting my chest myself and someone else inflicting pain there.\u00a0 I talked about self-injury and she looked worried.\u00a0 She knows that was in my past, but I had never really talked about it with her.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t regretting the tattoo; I was realizing that the experience had been triggering, no matter how tough I seemed and how good it felt.I\u2019d like to get more tattoos on my chest.\u00a0 I fantasize about swimming, being shirt-less, with a sweet chest piece on display.\u00a0 I am pre-testosterone and pre-surgery (or am I no-hormone and non operative?\u00a0 I have yet to know).\u00a0 For now I continue\u00a0this non-relating\u00a0to my breasts/chest.\u00a0 Maybe someday that could change.\u00a0 Maybe someday\u00a0I will have the chest I envision (flat and muscular, a male chest).\u00a0\u00a0Although I don\u2019t feel completely male,\u00a0I don\u2019t feel completely here, in this body, either\u2026____________________________________________________I wrote this in 2010.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been feeling differently about my chest within the past few months, which is exciting.\u00a0 I had been increasingly wanting to get top surgery, for sure, at some point.\u00a0 But since being on this low-dose of testosterone, I\u2019m not so concerned about it!\u00a0 It feels good to be touched there.\u00a0 Also, my pecs have gotten a little more prominent / maybe my chest is even smaller than before.\u00a0 For now, I can live with it!\u00a0 (We\u2019ll see what the future holds.)Also a quick rant:\u00a0 If you are collecting submissions for a project, a rejection letter / email is 100X better than no email at all.\u00a0 Or, if you end up just dropping the ball on your project, please let people who submitted know the status.\u00a0 I was wondering for a long time what happened after submitting my piece.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 24 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
