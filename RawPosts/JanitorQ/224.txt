You feeling comfortable in your own skin is something I have wanted for you ever since we hit puberty. That change is difficult for everyone, but it seemed to wreak havoc on you, as I\u2019m sure it does on everyone who doesn\u2019t fit in the tiny little boxes our society has labeled \u201cgirl\u201d and \u201cboy.\u201d It was surreal to watch you struggle with your identity when, to me, you were always YOU. And I did a truly shitty job of being your friend and supporting you at that time.\u00a0 I\u2019m really sorry.\u00a0 Now, I just feel so happy to hear that you\u2019re ridding your life of the things that no longer serve you and that you\u2019re finding solutions to elements of your life that never seemed to fit quite right before.\u201dWhen I read this, tears started streaming down my face; it\u2019s one of the most touching things someone\u2019s ever written to me.\u00a0 Largely because she\u2019s saying that she KNEW, and at the time, I had no idea anyone could see how much pain I was in, and I guess I didn\u2019t even see the pain, or, I just did my best to normalize it.\u00a0 And also because even though I\u2019m not sure how versed she is in trans* identities and gender politics, that actually has no bearing on her knowing what I\u2019m saying.\u00a0 She knows, because she knows who I am, and that feels so personally connecting, and intensely empowering.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 23 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
