Perriguey, has stated, \u201cOregon law has allowed for people to petition a court for a gender change for years, but the law doesn\u2019t specify that it has to be either male or female.\u00a0 The law just says, \u2018change.\u2019 Historically, people have asked for a gender change from male to female and the other way around, but Jamie is the first to ask for the gender of \u2018non-binary.'\u201dThis is the first time this has had a successful outcome in the United States.\u00a0 I\u2019d be curious to know whether others have tried before, in other states?According to the New York Times, the judge, Amy Holmes Hehn, told Mr. Perriguey that he was \u201cpushing the envelope.\u201d\u00a0 And the attorney\u2019s response was, \u201cWe\u2019re not, really. The envelope just needs to get bigger.\u201d\u00a0 I love that!\u00a0 The full article can be found here:\u00a0 Oregon Court Allows a Person to Choose Neither Sex.\u00a0 I am psyched.\u00a0 I feel that, within my lifetime, I will be able to do this too.Another cool thing:\u00a0 A few months ago, The New York Times started an ongoing project where trans-people could share their own stories, in their own words.\u00a0 (I participated in this too.\u00a0 Here\u2019s what I wrote:\u00a0 Kameron.)\u00a0 You can still share your story too:\u00a0 Share Your Story.Jamie wrote, among other things, about their experiences in the military, all the discrimination they faced, and that although they legally changed their gender and name, the military would not change their ID card.\u00a0 \u201cAfter a bad experience in the ER of having a female patient bracelet cut off and replaced with a male bracelet that had my old name in front of a room full of people, I asked the Army for a new ID card, and for my gender to be changed in their DEERS computer system.\u00a0 The Army responded with demands that I have unwanted SRS surgery, and that my spouse of 27 years relinquish her military benefits.\u201dRead the rest of their story here:\u00a0 Jamie Shupe.\u00a0 (At the time of the story, they identified as female.)\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
