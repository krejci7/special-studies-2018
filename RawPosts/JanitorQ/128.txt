I\u2019m on the verge of grasping/rejecting technological innovations.\u00a0 I\u2019m comfortable right where I am, hanging out at the edge of all these precipices.\u00a0 Due to my age , gender identity, and complex feelings about technology, I find myself neither here nor there in terms of what feels best.\u00a0 I continue to mix and match as I go, remaining critical along the way.I was born in 1981, which means I most definitely did not grow up with cell phones or internet access.\u00a0 Even though they were available in the 80s, we didn\u2019t have cable television, a microwave oven, or a portable telephone either (picture a tan rotary telephone mounted to the wall, with a long, coiled cord).\u00a0 I have always been wary of new technologies as they slowly embed themselves into our collective landscape and my individual lifestyle.\u00a0 The transitions never feel seamless.\u00a0 They always impact me greatly, imprinting upon my memories\u2026The first time I used a microwave:\u00a0 I was a kid.\u00a0 I was at the grocery store with my dad, and there was a station where you could microwave your own bag of popcorn.\u00a0 Like many people do all of the time, even after 20+ years of practice, we burnt the popcorn, popped open the microwave door, and let the stench waft out, affecting shoppers within a 100ft radius.\u00a0 I felt mortified and ashamed.\u00a0 My dad seemed unfazed, but we didn\u2019t try again.The first time I used a cell phone:\u00a0 It was 2003, and I was a senior in college.\u00a0 My parents had given me a cell phone during our visit with no further discussion really, other than it was covered under their family plan.\u00a0 I buried it somewhere within my apartment and continued to use my landline (however infrequent that was).\u00a0 My mom later commented to me, \u201cWe can never get ahold of you!\u00a0 Why don\u2019t you answer your cell phone?\u201d\u00a0 Honestly, I can\u2019t say.\u00a0 It just felt anxiety inducing.\u00a0 At some point, I must have gotten the hang of it \u2013 of being forever accessible \u2013 because I now am the proud owner of a Samsung flip-phone and I carry it everywhere.\u00a0 I see the benefits of this, but I\u2019m only partially on board.\u00a0 I rarely text, I keep my phone on vibrate, oftentimes I let a call just go to voice mail, and I call back when I am ready.The first time I used the Internet:\u00a0 We had a super slow dial-up server called Prodigy.\u00a0 It was 1998.\u00a0 Again, I can\u2019t recall any discussion amongst my family about what the Internet is and what can we do with it \u2013 suddenly it just was.\u00a0 I recall going on a message board to talk about music.\u00a0 I talked about REM with a stranger for a while before he abruptly asked me what size bra I wear.\u00a0 I felt a mixture of complex emotions before simply replying, \u201can A cup, I think.\u00a0 I don\u2019t really know.\u201d\u00a0 He replied, \u201cOh, that\u2019s alright sweetheart, that\u2019s enough for me to work with.\u201d\u00a0 How did he know my gender?\u00a0 How did this space for nerds and fans devolve so quickly into a space for pervs to jack-off?\u00a0 I didn\u2019t engage; just signed off.\u00a0 I don\u2019t remember going back on the internet much after that until I got to college; my usage was very limited, and remains, in many ways, fairly limited, even today.The ways I use the internet has definitely progressed and shifted, but I am far from the seamless IRL/virtual world many people appear to inhabit.\u00a0 I do not have a smart phone nor do I plan on ever getting a smart phone.\u00a0 I have \u201conline time\u201d and \u201coffline time,\u201d and I need those two to be separate.\u00a0 You\u2019ll never see me walking down the street, seemingly talking to myself or staring at a screen. My trans identity has shifted along with the ways I view the Internet, over time.\u00a0 It has blossomed and bloomed, halted and shriveled, sputtered and shuddered and begun to bloom again.\u00a0 In terms of deep soul searching, the Internet has never been my go-to place to glean information.\u00a0 The library was that place.\u00a0 I spent countless hours (hours enough to rival Internet time) in the \u201cHQ\u201d stacks of my college library.\u00a0 Specifically HQ 71-79:\u00a0 \u201csexual deviations, bisexuality, homosexuality, lesbianism, transvestism, transsexualism, sadism, masochism, fetishism.\u201d\u00a0 For all that time spent searching, I didn\u2019t do a whole lot of actual reading \u2013 many of these books were so dense and research-centric.\u00a0 I would often just go there to try to clear my head.\u00a0 Just sit.\u00a0 One particular book does stand out above the rest though:\u00a0 Loren Cameron\u2019s Body Alchemy.\u00a0 Filled with stunning photographs and personal stories, I could find glimpses of myself amongst these pages.Stay tuned for Part 2, where I flesh out these ideas, fill in some gaps, and really get into my trans-identity a lot more.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
