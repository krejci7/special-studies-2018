Riker becomes close with J\u2019naii pilot Soren, who reveals that she identifies as female, but is closeted because her people think that gender is a perversion. When their affair is discovered, Soren is forced to undergo \u201cpsychotectic therapy\u201d to convert her to theproper genderless state. Although this episode is an allegory for gay rights, the gender neutrality is interesting and rare for the time.\u201d\u00a0 I need to seek this out, just for this plot line!!!Anybody got any other examples out there?!?\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
