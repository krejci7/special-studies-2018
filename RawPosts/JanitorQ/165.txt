They will study engineering. They will get a job. They will find a partner and make a home. They will begin with finding a T-shirt.\u201d\u00a0 This quote sums up the tone of the article.Had I been the subject, it would have been nothing like this at all. I\u2019ve been to college (glad that\u2019s over with!!!). I have a job. I have a partner. We have made a home. I have a T-shirt. In fact, I have many T-shirts. Haha.This story is no doubt important.\u00a0 However (and I\u2019m definitely biased here, bordering on ageist maybe) I think it\u2019s really really necessary that there are representations of older, established non-binary people.\u00a0 It\u2019s not just a young people\u2019s thing.\u00a0 (Not to imply that young people will be growing out if it \u2013 they won\u2019t be!)\u00a0 I just mean that it\u2019s not just something someone is focusing on at the time when they are naturally growing into their identities, just at the beginning of starting new chapters of their lives.\u00a0 There is, relatively speaking, a lot of representations (if even just online only) of young people, starting to question and figure these things out.Gender identity issues are multi-generational.\u00a0 They are lifelong, and they come with different sets of challenges at different stages in life.\u00a0 I hope more media outlets will start jumping on the bandwagon (in respectful ways!) and more articles will pop up, with more frequency, soon.\u00a0 And that those articles will focus on other identities within non-binary genders, and different age brackets, different ethnic backgrounds, different socioeconomic backgrounds, etc.And if I\u2019m not seeing it, I\u2019ve toyed with the idea of writing my own article, here.\u00a0 Like, pretending I am a reporter, looking in.\u00a0 Look for that in the near future, maybe!\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
