purposefully progressing at a snail\u2019s pace.\u00a0 Example:\u00a0 it took me 10 years of deliberating to decide to try out testosterone.\u00a0 I have plans for other steps I want / need to take (legal name change, top surgery), but I can\u2019t see any concrete ways those plans might be materializing in the near future (haven\u2019t even socially changed name yet, what to tell work about top surgery?!).Overall, this is OK.\u00a0 I know that ultimately I control the speed of things.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that I need all these things ASAP (or, if I suddenly do, I could change my priorities and get moving!).\u00a0 Fortunately, it\u2019s not about waiting on things that are out of my control:\u00a0 bureaucratic processes and medical gatekeepers and getting funds together.\u00a0 It\u2019s not really any of those things.\u00a0 It\u2019s all me, at least at this point.\u00a0 I need to be taking things this slowly.Sometimes though, I get really really frustrated and just wish I were where I see myself already.\u00a0 At this rate, it\u2019ll be another 10-20 years!\u00a0 At times, I get so super indignant that my identity feels so fractured.\u00a0 Why does it have to be this way?\u00a0 It\u2019s society\u2019s fault I am where I\u2019m at!\u00a0 I want to be an actual person, in all areas of my life.\u00a0 I try to remind myself that everyone is fractured, to varying degrees.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a transgender-specific thing.\u00a0 Everyone has their out-in-public persona and their work persona and their laid-back hanging-out persona and the really good stuff that they only reveal to a select few, etc.\u00a0 And at the same time, it\u2019s much more than a transgender-specific thing.\u00a0 I\u2019m too private for my own good, about anything and everything!I just wish, at times, that I could line up all my ducks and without going through the effort, everyone would magically know that this is my name and these are my pronouns and this is how I feel and I plan on these changes in the future.\u00a0 I\u2019m in limbo about my name.\u00a0 The pronoun situation is getting a little bit better.\u00a0 I struggle at times with feeling like a whole person.\u00a0 Sometimes I feel invisible.Yesterday, I changed my facebook profile to match who I actually am, a little more than ever before.\u00a0 A small change, but it felt huge!\u00a0 Me \u2018n facebook:\u00a0 about five years ago, a few friends were urging me to join.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t really want to, partially because I wasn\u2019t out to this person and to that person, and there was no one way my profile could be that would make me feel both comfortable with not being out, and also happy.\u00a0 I was so private about so many things.\u00a0 However, I thought it might be beneficial to set up a facebook page for a performance group I was a part of.\u00a0 I set that up as if it were a personal page (as opposed to a group page), but it wasn\u2019t really personal at all.\u00a0 And that\u2019s how it\u2019s been for 5 years.\u00a0 I\u2019ve maintained the page, updating about shows, posting pictures from past shows, etc.\u00a0 For a while in there, a friend and I were co-operating the page.\u00a0 The page is the group\u2019s name \u2013 not my name.However, the group has been defunct for the past two years or so.\u00a0 I mean, we might put on another show at any time(!!!), but mostly, it\u2019s inactive.\u00a0 Meanwhile, I\u2019ve been navigating facebook in a limbo-land.\u00a0 I rarely ever post.\u00a0 I \u201clike\u201d other people\u2019s things as this group page.\u00a0 Profile pictures have been performers.\u00a0 Sometimes the profile pic is me, but I\u2019m \u201cin disguise.\u201d\u00a0 Some people know that I am this page, and they tag pics of me accordingly.\u00a0 Others have probably been confused.\u00a0 \u201cMy\u201d birthday is listed as the date of this group\u2019s inception.\u00a0 It\u2019s been weird and disjointed, but, strangely, reflective of how I feel in the world at large.I\u2019ve recently been in touch with an old friend via email and he asked me about facebook.\u00a0 So I \u201cfriended\u201d him through this page.\u00a0 He later wrote to me [edited for length], \u201cI assume you are \u201chidden\u201d on facebook for a reason, but please know that I have had conversations with [mutual friend] and [your freshmen year roommate] about your whereabouts.\u00a0 Please know that \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d has never applied regarding peoples\u2019 affections for you.\u201d\u00a0 That hit me hard.\u00a0 I simultaneously wanted to hug him and argue with him.I\u2019ve been trying to improve this outlook for a while, and take charge of all these fragmented feelings.\u00a0 Yesterday, I finally decided to make some changes.\u00a0 I switched the profile picture to a pic of my face, for the first time ever.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been taken aback by how many \u201clikes\u201d and comments this move has brought about.\u00a0 It feels good.\u00a0 I changed my birthday and my gender identity, to actually reflect who I am.\u00a0 The profile is still in the group\u2019s name, largely because 1) I don\u2019t know if I want to easily be found by any and everyone at this point.\u00a0 Er, I know that I don\u2019t!\u00a0 2) I don\u2019t know what name I actually want to go by.One day, I will have a name, gender identity, pronouns, and a life that is accessible and understood by everyone!\u00a0 I have so far to go still.\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
