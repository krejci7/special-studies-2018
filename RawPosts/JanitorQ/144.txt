____________________________________For over a decade, I had been going back and forth thousands of times in my head about whether transitioning, or partial transition, was right for me or not.\u00a0 At some point not that long ago, I seemed to come to the conclusion that no, I wasn\u2019t going to move forward because if I were, I would have done something about it by now.\u00a0 And I haven\u2019t, so I\u2019m not.\u00a0 I must be lacking some internal drive, so it must not be something that I need to do.\u00a0 I settled on identifying as genderqueer and trans* but not planning on medically transitioning in any way.\u00a0 But I was not quite satisfied, not at all actually.\u00a0 Because it was still on my mind.\u00a0 Sometimes just as whimsical musings in the back of my brain.\u00a0 Other times as pervasive/invasive body-dysphoric consistent ruminations.I thought it had to be all or nothing.\u00a0 I thought I had to have a case ready about how I need to transition, in order to access testosterone.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t need to transition, and I really don\u2019t like to lie.\u00a0 I thought I would need a letter from a therapist, and to jump through all these hoops, to access testosterone, at least in my town, locally.\u00a0 And I wasn\u2019t even sure I wanted it!\u00a0 Eventually I reached a point where I just knew that I needed to try it, just so that I could know.\u00a0 So that at the very least, I could think about it differently or think about it less often, as it relates to a decision about something I should or should not do.I have this awesome therapist.\u00a0 She doesn\u2019t know much about trans* identities.\u00a0 I\u2019m fairly certain she had not previously had a trans* client before, although I could be wrong.\u00a0 I\u2019d been talking to her about this stuff, and she\u2019d been following along, more or less, in stride.\u00a0 When I would say I need to try this out, she would say, \u201cthen why not!\u201d\u00a0 I asked her if she\u2019d write me a letter if need be, and she said she wouldn\u2019t be comfortable doing that; she doesn\u2019t have enough knowledge about it.\u00a0 Still operating under the assumption that I would need a letter, I started also seeing another therapist, basically for the purpose of getting a letter.This second therapist gave me the name of a doctor during our first session.\u00a0 Turns out that, apparently, I didn\u2019t need a letter!\u00a0 Turns out I didn\u2019t need to convince anyone at any point that I wanted to transition medically.\u00a0 I never once had to lie to get my hands on testosterone.\u00a0 And once I did get my hands on it, I was given the freedom to experiment with the dosing, basically use as much or as little as I wanted.\u00a0 Turns out I want to use as little as possible.\u00a0 Turns out I might be able to stay on it for the rest of my life without looking any more masculine than I currently do (this has yet to be proven, but it\u2019s been 6 months now, and so far, so good).\u00a0 And the internal effects, with this super low dose, are significant and pretty much better than I could have even hoped for.Basically, for all those years of wondering and second-guessing and processing and feeling anxious and obsessing and daydreaming and doubting myself and ultimately sort of concluding by default that I wouldn\u2019t take any steps forward, actually doing something about it has been one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made.And in retrospect, it isn\u2019t like there\u2019s no turning back, to some extent.\u00a0 Testosterone is a slow-moving substance in terms of long-term changes\u2026 I\u2019m really enjoying the internal forward momentum though. __________________________________Now that it\u2019s been close to two years on testosterone, I am at a new normal.\u00a0 I have used the gel every single day, and the benefits have been astronomical.\u00a0 BUT, I forget now; I forget what I used to feel like.\u00a0 I can feel myself approaching a new stage, a stage where I look like someone in between, more so than I already am.\u00a0 This new stage might involve shaving (or plucking chin hairs at a faster pace than I currently do.)\u00a0 It might involve a lot more explaining and coming out.\u00a0 It might involve top surgery and a name change.\u00a0 This is my transition, in process.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
