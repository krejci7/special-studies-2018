(Why can\u2019t I just grow out of this???).\u00a0 Some people get stress-induced migraines or upset stomachs or struggle with insomnia.\u00a0 Anything like that is, without a doubt, difficult to deal with.\u00a0 In a big way, I am glad I am not afflicted with those stress-responses.\u00a0 In some way though, a part of me wishes for something like that instead,\u00a0 but only because it\u2019s relate-able and I\u2019d probably feel like I could talk about it with others.\u00a0 \u201cMy stomach is in knots thinking about what I have to do.\u201d\u00a0 Or, \u201cI\u2019m losing sleep over this.\u201d\u00a0 These phrases are super common.When I get stressed out for long enough, it feels like my brain is rotting away.\u00a0 I lose brain functioning (not a figure of speech \u2013 my cognitive abilities actually suffer in some big ways.)\u00a0 But more than this:\u00a0 It feels as if my brain has turned against me; I am bombarded by visions \u2013 images of violence being inflicted upon me.\u00a0 I do not know what I can do.\u00a0 I can distract myself.\u00a0 I can try stress reduction techniques.\u00a0 I can (and do) follow through with inflicting pain on myself in an attempt to stop the visions.\u00a0 None of these things have ever worked too well when I\u2019m actually in it.\u00a0 When I was younger, I was \u201cin it\u201d on-and-off for years and years and years.\u00a0 It would become intolerable.\u00a0 It\u2019d be beyond intolerable, but, of course, I had to keep waking up and living it, over and over again because there\u2019s no getting away from your own mind.Often, my brain would feel so rotten that I couldn\u2019t read, I couldn\u2019t make sense of things on TV or in movies.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t talk to people or follow a conversation.\u00a0 Eventually I couldn\u2019t do any schoolwork at all.\u00a0 (And it wasn\u2019t about concentration, which is a common issue with people who are depressed.\u00a0 It was specifically that synapses seemingly disintegrated.)\u00a0 I made it through because luckily I had a therapist at home and a therapist at school, and they helped advocate for me to get accommodations I needed to not flunk or drop out of college.\u00a0 I felt like dropping out.\u00a0 I \u201cgot by\u201d with very high grades, because I couldn\u2019t have lived with myself with anything less.\u00a0 ???\u00a0 Does this make any sense at all?\u00a0 I was barely functioning, yet I somehow ended up with very high marks.\u00a0 If my grades had ended up slipping, I would have been even more abusive to myself.\u00a0 Maybe the people around me could sense that.Somehow, I could still write, surprisingly eloquently.\u00a0 Although, it was limited to journal-style writing, not academic-style writing.\u00a0 Like what I\u2019m doing right now.\u00a0 When I can\u2019t seem to do anything else.I get barraged with images spanning from mild (such as my face being slapped or my skin being cut) to morbid (such as being hacked away at with an axe.\u00a0 Or my head being whacked repeatedly with a 2\u00d74.\u00a0 Or falling and hitting my head so hard that I pass out.\u00a0 Or my neck being held down as I am whipped over and over and over again.)\u00a0 These images are never sexual.\u00a0 They are disturbing and unwanted.\u00a0 I seem to have no control over them.I have heard of some people struggling with urges to actively do something they do not actually want to do.\u00a0 Like inflicting pain onto someone else.\u00a0 Or stepping off the subway platform in front of a subway.\u00a0 Or driving their car off the road and down a steep ravine.\u00a0 There is an excellent graphic novel I would highly recommend that is largely about this compulsion.\u00a0 It\u2019s called The Nao of Brown.\u00a0 What I\u2019m talking about is so similar, yet strikingly different.\u00a0 I am never the one in control.\u00a0 I\u2019m not harming anyone else or actively harming myself.\u00a0 It is always an anonymous person outside the visual frame, inflicting violence on me.\u00a0 I\u2019m the object; I\u2019m looking at myself.Last week I told my therapist, \u201cwhoever made brains needs to try again.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
