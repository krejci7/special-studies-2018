It\u2019s called \u201cFeatured Voices,\u201d and the month\u2019s topic is top surgery.  There have been 3 other posts before this one \u2013 go to his website and check it out!  And stay tuned for future topics!genderqueer.meContinuing\u00a0February\u2019s\u00a0theme of Featured Voices: Top Surgery\u00a0I wanted to highlight someone in his\u00a0mid-thirties\u00a0who has learned to comfortably inhabit that genderqueer limbo, yet still makes\u00a0time to self-reflect about\u00a0body,\u00a0gender, past, and\u00a0future.\u00a0After 12 years of thinking about it, Kameron scheduled top surgery. With express clarity, Kameron walks us through the years leading up to\u00a0this decision.
