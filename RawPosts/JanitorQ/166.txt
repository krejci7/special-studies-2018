Itâ€™s been a year and a half!Â  I increased my dosage of Androgel, slightly, about 3 months ago (from 1 pump of 1% daily to 1 pump of 1.62% daily), and still, Iâ€™m not seeing physical changes (which is still a big part of my goals).Â  I have still not yet missed a day â€“ applying the gel feels of utmost importance to me, as a part of my daily routine.Nothing can be new forever, unfortunately.Â  Naturally, I no longer have that same emotional reaction to applying the gel (anticipation, excitement).Â  And I havenâ€™t been thinking about it in the same ways as I did every single day for that first year (how totally fucking awesome it is).Â  Still it feels very much essential.Â  Itâ€™s not nearly as constant, but I do still reflect on how different things are for me now.â€“ I am grateful that I consistently feel like eating at regular intervals now. â€“ Iâ€™m grateful that I no longer feel quite as debilitated by anxiety-induced adrenaline surges â€“ Iâ€™m grateful that physical sensations make more sense.Â  Pain actually feels painful.Â  I donâ€™t recoil from affectionate touches.Â  When I take a deep breath, I feel a sense of calm and a connection to my body.Â  Etc. forever. â€“ Iâ€™m grateful that sex finally makes sense, and that I get to be a part of it (usually.Â  At least itâ€™s much improved.) â€“ Iâ€™m grateful that although Iâ€™m still moody and seem to feel emotions relatively strongly, itâ€™s become more manageable, and rarely manifests in self-destructive ways anymore. â€“ Iâ€™m grateful that I donâ€™t feel so cold all the time! â€“ Iâ€™m grateful that things just feel easier, across the board.I am genderqueer (in case you didnâ€™t already know!) and am continuing to carve out a space in between genders.Â  Or, to mix and match genders as I see fit.Â  I feel like Iâ€™ve made a ton of progress in terms of finding that place where I feel like myself, in my own skin.Â  Yet, not nearly enough progress in terms of seeing that identity reflected back to me from the world around me.Â  This just means I have a long ways to go (And society has a much longer way to go.Â  Câ€™mon society, get with it!) until I really feel comfortable with the ways Iâ€™m seen by others.Â  Luckily, that part is not nearly as important as the part about how I see myself.Â  ðŸ™‚Initially, I feel like I was being hyper vigilant about not crossing over into any masculinizing territory, especially with my voice dropping.Â  As time has gone on, Iâ€™m not quite so concerned with this (although Iâ€™m not actually trying for it either.)Â  I do wonder if my attitudes will change more, in this vein, and Iâ€™ll start to want to increase my dose even more and cross into that territory.Â  Only time will tell.Â  As of now, Iâ€™m feeling comfortable with where I am.Hereâ€™s where Iâ€™ve been (there are lots of details about the subtle physical changes in these past posts):Five months  Eight months Eleven months One year A video at the one year mark One point two-five years And finally, a couple of pictures of my face:1.5 years on testosterone1.25 years on testosteroneone year on testosteroneÂ Â
