[last name].\u201d\u00a0 She verbalized that back to me to make sure it was right, and I said, \u201cYep.\u201d\u00a0 I should have that up hopefully within a couple of weeks, finally.\u00a0 This feels like such a victory!There\u2019s one other thing I want to mention regarding mental health:\u00a0 I started listening exclusively to a new-to-me podcast.\u00a0 By this, I mean, I listen to podcasts every day while at work.\u00a0 And previously, that would be somewhere between 5-8 different ones at any given time.\u00a0 Right now, for whatever reason, I\u2019m just listening to one, all day every day.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get tired of it and get back to some of my other ones, but for now, it\u2019s pretty mesmerizing.\u00a0 If you\u2019re interested in checking it out, it\u2019s called the Mental Illness Happy Hour.\u00a0 It is definitely not for the faint of heart.\u00a0 The host jokes that he does not give advanced notice for triggers because he would have to stop every couple of minutes to announce another Trigger Warning.\u00a0 And it is absolutely true.\u00a0 There is a lot of stuff about abuse of all kinds, dark secrets and shame, both sexual in nature and just like, the kinds of stuff that randomly pops in your head and you hate yourself for thinking it.\u00a0 The host lightens things up by being in turns uplifting and darkly humorous.\u00a0 Each show is somewhere between 2-3 hours (!?!), and he\u2019d read people\u2019s surveys they\u2019ve sent in anonymously, and he will also interview one person per show.\u00a0 He\u2019s doing all this seemingly on his own, and he\u2019s making a living off of it.\u00a0 I\u2019m kinda obsessed right now.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
