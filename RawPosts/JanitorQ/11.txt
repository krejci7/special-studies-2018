Johnson \u2013 You can watch this movie on Neflix if you want.\u00a0 So, this is really only some of the story.\u00a0 There is a lot of controversy surrounding the production of this film and who\u2019s work is being credited, which we only found out about the day before we were going to see it.\u00a0 Here\u2019s one article that gets into all the details:\u00a0\u00a0What Would Trans Art Look Like if it Was Only Made By Trans People?\u00a0\u00a0To sum it up in one sentence, a trans-woman of color \u2013 Reina Gossett \u2013 has been working on a film about Marsha P. Johnson, and she had done a ton of legwork and archival studying.\u00a0 Then this dude \u2013 David France \u2013 swoops in with his finances and his connections and essentially steals the work that had been made thus far.\u00a0 So, our experience was a little bit soured, but I have to admit it was still a good film.\u00a0 And I hope Reina Gossett is still feeling empowered to move ahead and create her own film \u2013 the more films that will educate people about transgender people and issues, the better.\u00a0 I just realized I didn\u2019t say anything about what this film is about \u2013 so go watch it on Netflix!\u00a0 Haha.Alaska is a Drag \u2013 This one was kinda campy.\u00a0 It features twins who are stuck living in Alaska \u2013 a gay guy working at a fish cannery, learning boxing, and fantasizing about making it big as a drag queen, and his sister who has cancer and is getting regular treatments, but her spirits are high, indulging in the world of drag her brother creates.\u00a0 It was so-so.\u00a0 Definitely different, but not all that compelling.Freak Show \u2013\u00a0This was SUPER campy.\u00a0 Directed by Trudy Styler (Sting\u2019s wife!)\u00a0 A kid has to move to a southern state and attend a super conservative high school.\u00a0 His mom is Bette Midler, er, I mean, a mom played by Bette Midler.\u00a0 He endures bullying on top of bullying and hate crimes and more and more violence.\u00a0 He then decides to up the ante and run for homecoming queen.\u00a0 Laverne Cox has a small role \u2013 that was one of the best parts.\u00a0 Also, costuming was stunning, but otherwise, I wasn\u2019t a huge fan.Saturday Church \u2013 This centers on a 14 year old boy named Ulysses.\u00a0 Similar themes as Freak Show, but the approach is a little more realistic.\u00a0 He starts to question his gender identity amidst bullying at school and conservative viewpoints from relatives.\u00a0 He meets other gender variant people of different stripes, they all convene at a youth service / shelter on Saturday nights.\u00a0 Kate Bornstein plays the person in charge of the space!!!\u00a0 They eat together, attend \u201cballs\u201d together, and talk about hardships.\u00a0 I liked this film a lot!\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
