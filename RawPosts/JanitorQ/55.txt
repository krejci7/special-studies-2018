I am starting to work toward getting in on this!In June, I posted about Jamie Shupe, the first person in the US to successfully petition for the gender status of \u201cnon-binary.\u201d\u00a0 Now as of September 26th, Sara Kelley Keenan is also legally non-binary.\u00a0 Here is a full article about it:\u00a0 Californian Becomes Second US Citizen Granted \u2018Non-Binary\u2019 Gender Status.I want to be the third!\u00a0 (Or the fourth, or the fifth, or the sixth, etc.\u00a0 The number doesn\u2019t matter to me at all; just that I get to do it, eventually.)I\u2019ve been stalling about changing my name legally, for a long time now.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a year and a half since I socially changed it, everywhere except for work.\u00a0 Part of the reason for waiting is because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing with my last name.\u00a0 And if there\u2019s a chance I\u2019m going to change it, I don\u2019t want to go through this process twice!And yeah, work is the other reason.\u00a0 I mean, I can legally change my name without coming out at work, but it would be great if the two goals aligned.And now I\u2019m wondering if I can change my name and also request the status of \u201cnon-binary\u201d all at once.\u00a0 I\u2019m in the process of finding this out.\u00a0 There is a social justice group called Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund (TLDEF) that partners with lawyers and law firms for pro bono work on issues including the Name Change Project.\u00a0 Luckily, I fall within their geographical range, so I filled out their form, and should hear back within two weeks!I also am fairly close to feeling good about moving forward with a new last name.\u00a0 I had one idea a long time ago but was unsure.\u00a0 Over time, I stopped thinking about it entirely, until just last week.\u00a0 I went to a therapy appointment for the first time in a few months, and that jump-started some thought processes that had been calcifying in the corners of my brain.\u00a0 Things got shaken up, and I\u2019ve been feeling consistently euphoric ever since.A little more about Sara Kelley Keenan:\u00a0 She is a 55 year-old retired paralegal who was born intersex.\u00a0 According to the article,Her court petition was a quiet, unannounced test case for a group of California people who also seek to change their legal genders to non-binary rather than female or male. About five people\u2014all working with the Intersex and Genderqueer Recognition Project\u2014plan to petition courts in the counties of San Francisco, Alameda, Santa Clara and Sacramento over the next few weeks.How awesome is that?!\u00a0 I\u2019m picturing a floodgate opening and people just pouring through.\u00a0 First five more people.\u00a0 Next fifty!\u00a0 \u2026\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m 55 years old, this doesn\u2019t really change my life very much.\u00a0 But I want to leave the world a better place for younger intersex people. This represents a huge opportunity for acceptance and awareness for young non-binary and intersex and trans people\u2014and for their parents.\u201dThere are still more barriers, though, of course.\u00a0 The DMV.\u00a0 Getting a passport.\u00a0 Other documents.\u00a0 Things are changing though, slowly but surely.\u00a0 Just last week, Shupe\u2019s attorney got an email from the Oregon DMV, stating,\u201c[the Oregon] DMV received the okay to move forth with forming an advisory committee and drafting administrative rules regarding the capturing of sex on the driver license. The rules will allow DMV to capture and print an identifier for sex other than M for male and F for female on the driver license, permit, and ID card.\u201dHassles!\u00a0 But, things are moving\u2026\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
