He actively participated in being my ally in a bunch of different ways. \u00a0I wrote about this a little, over a year ago, here: I came out to my co-workerAs soon as I told him about my preferred name, he started using it when no one else was around. \u00a0He called me \u201cKam-Ron\u201d at first, and then just shortened it to \u201cKam.\u201d \u00a0This later became, \u201cKilla Kam\u201d and \u201cCuz.\u201d \u00a0He lightly pressured me to come out at work when he could feel it was imminent. \u00a0I appreciate it more than he\u2019ll know. Well, he does kinda know \u2013\u00a0I explicitly told\u00a0him yesterday that I wanted to thank him for being my ally, most specifically.Super early on, he organized a district-wide work happy hour at his dive bar. \u00a0I was the only one who showed up. \u00a0Later, he narrowed down the guest list, and our co-workers / kitchen staff hung out one time outside of work. \u00a0That was a first! \u00a0He later bonded with me through my enthusiasm with a local community radio station I volunteer with. \u00a0He came on the air with me on two occasions, taking pics and putting them on facebook and just hyping it all up in general. \u00a0One time, we met for lunch before work. \u00a0That was a first.Last night, I picked\u00a0us up some tacos from that place we had lunch the one time, and we\u00a0just chit-chatted one last time. \u00a0He had gotten a bunch of cards from students, like whole classes-worth, and a couple of gifts from teachers. \u00a0He was exuberant, like he often is, gesticulating a lot, not sitting down, etc. \u00a0I was low-key, like usual, trying\u00a0to offset that a bit. \u00a0While still being interested / engaged.I\u2019ve never met anyone like this person. \u00a0I observed the ways he navigates through situations with my eyes and ears perked. \u00a0Out of everything I learned from him, I think the most all encompassing thing was what he summed up as \u201cteamwork makes the dream work.\u201d \u00a0(He would say this a lot.) \u00a0But not teamwork in the way I knew of teamwork \u2013 this is a different brand of teamwork. \u00a0I thought of\u00a0\u201cteamwork\u201d as doing the same thing at the same time with another person or group of people, until the job was done. \u00a0But whenever I tried to enact that with him, we would usually clash. \u00a0His teamwork involves a network of small favors with as many people as possible, like, \u201cI do this, which motivates you to do that,\u201d kind of thing. \u00a0Which may or may not work depending on the other person, but he is an extremely motivational person. \u00a0In addition to just going way above and beyond, in that rare situation which arises from time to time, just to help you out.He made a personal connection with probably almost every single person, whether principal or teacher or part-time staff, in the entire school. \u00a0And now he\u2019s moving on to go do that in a school that\u2019s twice or maybe three times as big.I\u2019ll miss him.I also wrote about the co-worker I had before this co-worker, here: Saying goodbye to my mentor / co-worker That was when he retired, two and a half years ago.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
