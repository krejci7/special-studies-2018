We work to spread awareness and to be an informational resource for those impacted by alcohol and drug dependence.I believe that our website would be a valuable addition to your resources listed on your page. \u00a0Would you please review our resource and consider adding it to your website to spread awareness\u201dAnd that got me thinking, because I don\u2019t have anything like that on my blog! \u00a0But I decided that I could \u2013 she kind of got me going to start organizing a resource page. \u00a0I told her, \u201cI\u2019ll need to start from scratch because I have yet to provide a resource page at all, but I love the idea, so thanks for that push!\u201d \u00a0And then I started working.I had always been of the mindset that although many blogs do have links to online safe spaces, hotlines, etc., I don\u2019t need to be one of those blogs \u2013 people can google whatever they want to google and glean information from myriad places. \u00a0I wouldn\u2019t even know how to narrow down a page. \u00a0Some, like Micah\u2019s on Neutrois Nonsense, for example, are so comprehensive, I don\u2019t really have anything to add!So, mine might be a bit random, and it\u2019s definitely not complete, by a long shot. \u00a0I included the one for the drug rehab site first, since she was the one to get me going. \u00a0I then added two overarching sites for mental health, Micah\u2019s blog (of course!), the blog of a professional gender therapist who is very hands-on, and then two sites that are geared toward brainstorming and creativity, when it comes to gender.You can take a look here: \u00a0LGBTQIA-GSM Resources. \u00a0Please lemme know if you want me to add anything in particular\u2026 \u00a0(The GSM stands for \u201cgender and sexual minorities,\u201d because there are not enough letters in the alphabet to cover everyone!)I\u2019ll just end with a little more information about the drug rehab website, mostly because I was so tickled that they wrote and wanted me to \u201cadvertise\u201d for them. \u00a0It makes me feel like, wow, cool, my blog really is reaching people. \u00a0(This is something that waxes and wanes for me, whether it\u2019s really out there or not.) \u00a0So, the outreach specialist said,\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
