As a control, some of the interviews focused not on transgender discrimination,\u00a0but on recycling.\u00a0In all cases, the 10-minute\u00a0interview included a\u00a0survey before and after to measure people\u2019s attitudes regarding transgender people, as well as follow-ups ranging up to 3 months later.\u201dThe goal is to get the voter to engage in a conversation, saying the words themselves, sort of so they\u2019re able to hear their own opinions, and to see if there\u2019s any wiggle room.\u00a0 A lot of times, there is!\u00a0 One out of 10 voters changed their minds over the course of a 20 minute conversation.\u00a0 And when surveyed 3 months later, the change appears to have stuck.This is so striking!\u00a0 It made me envision myself going door to door.\u00a0 Could I do that?\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure, but more likely, I could see myself being a part of a panel, and even more likely, I could see myself trying to get my writing out to a wider audience\u2026To make good on that, I\u2019m going to post this on facebook!\u00a0 (Something I rarely do.)\u00a0 I\u2019m gonna spread the word through my local indymedia too!\u00a0 Any way possible.I feel like there is hope.All quotes are either from This American Life, or the Science Magazine article, here:\u00a0 \u201cFor real this time: Talking to people about gay and transgender issues can change their prejudices.\u201dAlso, as a note, there\u2019s information about a study that came before this one, that was most likely falsified.\u00a0 While this is intriguing, it kind of diverts attention away from the amazing findings of this more recent, scientifically sound, study.\u00a0 So just kinda gloss over that controversy\u2026*I\u2019m pretty sure he meant to say, \u201cwomen\u2019s clothes.\u201d\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
