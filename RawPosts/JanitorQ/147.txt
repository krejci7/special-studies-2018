(Meaning my life right now.\u00a0 Lots of time travel in this post!)This film is seriously outdated in some ways, and also relevant and timeless in other ways.\u00a0 My favorite line is, when the father says, \u201cI thought that we were just going to have a lesbian on our hands.\u201d\u00a0 I laughedIt portrays different reactions from family members pretty well \u2013 the dad uses his correct name and pronouns and speaks lovingly of his son.\u00a0 The mom misgenders him consistently, yet you can tell the love is there.\u00a0 The grandma cannot get past the emotional hurt of how this feels to her.\u00a0 It\u2019s kinda heartbreaking to watch, but also I just want to shake her.\u00a0 The sister is detached mostly, away at college, but has no problem with her brother\u2019s life path.Give it a watch if you\u2019ve got the time!\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
