"I attended the Philadelphia Trans-Health Conference back in mid-June and wrote a summary of the workshops I made it to, but I left out the details of one workshop because I felt it warranted a post all to itself.\u00a0 I stumbled into \u201cA Gender Not Listed here\u201d late Saturday afternoon, feeling a little bit drained, but excited about the topic, which was going to be a summary and discussion of an article that was published in April, 2012.\u00a0 The information was based on findings of a study completed by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality in 2008.\u00a0 It surveyed 6,450\u00a0T-GNC-GQ\u00a0 (transgender, gender non-conforming, genderqueer) individuals from\u00a0all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\u00a0 It is by far the largest sample size of this population to date.(The presenters commented that they got a lot of flak from peers ahead of time \u2013 their colleagues thought it was foolish to put forth a 70 question survey, claiming people would not fill it out in its entirety.\u00a0 To then see the number of completed surveys that came back is really a testament to how much this community craves to be heard, to share their thoughts, opinions, and identities.)So, to reiterate, the survey was for anyone who identifies as transgender / gender non-conforming.\u00a0 Question #3 of the survey asked, \u201cWhat is your primary gender identity today?\u00a0 1.Male/man, 2.Female/woman, 3.Part time as one gender, part time as another, 4.A gender not listed here, please specify _________\u201d\u00a0 This workshop honed in on the 13.3% of people who answered question #3 of the survey with option #4.\u00a0 Most of the data was about how this statistically relates to other factors such as age, ethnicity, education, region, household income, and discriminatory factors (employment, health and health care, violence, etc.)It was totally eye opening!\u00a0 I had no idea this data has been out there, for a couple of years now.\u00a0 Even just the knowledge that about 13% of people who identify as transgender also identify as neither male nor female (or living part time as such) is mind-blowing.\u00a0 Not mind-blowing as in it\u2019s surprisingly lower or surprisingly higher than I might have imagined (it\u2019s not).\u00a0 But mind-blowing as in there actually is a statistical estimate out there, at least for the US.\u00a0 And why is this study not more widely known?!!I\u2019m not going to pick apart all the details of the statistical analyses, but I hope you might want to take a glance.\u00a0 Here is a summary of the report, broken down really nicely:\u00a0 Check out this modified version!If you\u2019re feeling ambitious and want to read the full 12 page report, it is here:\u00a0 Genderqueers, Gender Rebels, and OtherWise!A general overview might go something like this:\u00a0 Those people who wrote in their own gender tend to be younger, more educated, less financially stable, and less likely to live in the midwest or south, and less likely to be white than their transgender counterparts.\u00a0 Also, it has been determined that:\u201cDespite their resilience and ability to define themselves in broader terms and to hold [different] ideas of identity in mind than conventional notions, overall Q3GNL  participants face greater discrimination, risk, and violence than their transgender counterparts in most of the survey categories.\u201dOf course factors of privilege come into play, and it\u2019s so convoluted to suss out what factors may lead to or predict other factors.\u00a0 It\u2019s simply a large data set from which future research can build from.\u00a0 That\u2019s part of the beauty of it \u2013 this information is public.\u00a0 So, for example, if you\u2019re a grad student who needs a thesis topic, or you\u2019re just really good at stats and have lots of free time on your hands, there is plenty of work still to be done and conclusions to draw from the raw data.\u00a0 Hopefully many will work with it in the future.One other interesting point to highlight is word choice:\u00a0 Since the question made room to fill in the blank, the range of terms for self-expression ended up being huge.\u00a0 39% of Q3GNL participants wrote in \u201cgenderqueer,\u201d 9.5% wrote in \u201cboth/neither, in-between, or non-binary,\u201d 2.2% wrote \u201cfluid.\u201d \u202616.8% chose another term all together, and that generated a list of over 100 unique words / phrases, including \u201cjest-me,\u201dtwidget,\u201d \u201cbest of both,\u201d \u201cgender blur,\u201d \u201ccyborg,\u201d and \u201cgenderqueer wombat fantastica\u201d hahaha.\u00a0 I know I wrote down a list of a lot more, at the conference.\u00a0 The presenters did a powerpoint presentation and the slide with all these identity ideas generated a lot of discussion.\u00a0 As soon as I find that list, I will post whatever else it was that I wrote down.Feels like I wanna get more creative with how I might describe myself!\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
