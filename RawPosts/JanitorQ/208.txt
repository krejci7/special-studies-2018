Oh man. But it turns out I didn\u2019t really say any shit about him, just wrote about a conversation the class had in which I was excluded from the female POV. And I was like, awesome! but in the journal, it sort of sounded like I felt sligted, because I call myself \u201cother.\u201d He didn\u2019t realize I love \u201cother,\u201d so he wrote to me in the email that it is easy to recall times when one has been slighted, but one must also remember times when one\u2019s unique humanity is recognized. (ex. showing Secretary in class.) So I just had to write back that I didn\u2019t feel slighted \u2013 I was pleased, rather, to be excluded from being able to speak from a female\u2019s POV. Yeah, I don\u2019t know if this makes much sense, but, he wrote back saying thanks for the clarification, and he also said to keep writing.\u00a0 \u201cYour blog writing shows promise.\u201dPromise for what? __________________________________Even though I was still a long way off from using the words non-binary, genderqueer, or trans* to describe myself (apparently preferring \u201cother\u201d haha), it\u2019s awesome to see I was thinking about it and writing about it.With this guy, it\u2019ll be just my luck that he\u2019ll find this post somehow and strike up a long-lost conversation with me, haha.\u00a0 College was weird.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 21 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
