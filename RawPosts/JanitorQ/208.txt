it hit me it was probably a really bad sign I couldn\u2019t get through to anyone.\u00a0 I finally got a message back from them, but I\u2019d started to lose interest and was already moving on to the next doctor.I got through immediately and asked if this doctor was taking new patients?\u00a0 I was told that if I\u2019m a friend or family member of a current patient, then yes.\u00a0 Or if I was being referred to her by a doctor of any sort, then yes.\u00a0 Wait, you need a referral for a primary care physician?!!\u00a0 I asked, \u201cIn what form should this referral take?\u00a0 Like a note from a doctor or an email?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo, you just tell us their name.\u201d\u00a0 I said OK thanks and hung up.So basically, I can see this doctor through the powers of nepotism and name dropping.\u00a0 (Warning, I\u2019m still highly suspicious of doctors.\u00a0 Doctors, please, prove me wrong!)\u00a0 I felt more determined than ever to see this doctor, just on principal, because I think this policy is fucked-up.\u00a0 She should either be taking new patients or not taking new patients.\u00a0 Period.I called my therapist (technically, she\u2019s a doctor) and asked her if she would refer me to this doctor.\u00a0 She said sure, she\u2019d do whatever, and that she\u2019s never heard of needing a referral for a PCP.\u00a0 She suggested that maybe I just misunderstood, and they just want to know how I heard about / was referred to this doctor.\u00a0 So when I called back, I gave them the benefit of the doubt, but it was reinforced that yes, I need a verbal referral.I then said that I have a therapist who will vouch for me.\u00a0 (The term \u201cvouch\u201d was never actually used, but that\u2019s what seems to be going on?)\u00a0 I was then put on hold, and they seemed to be attempting a stalling tactic.\u00a0 She (receptionist) said she is short staffed and busy, could I call back Thurs. or Fri. of this week?\u00a0 I was assured that I\u2019d be able to make an appt. at that time, and I was directed to name-drop whoever at that time.So I followed these directions and finally got an appointment!\u00a0 (For 3 months from now.)\u00a0 A few days later, a packet of paperwork arrived in the mail, and I immediately opened it and started to peruse.\u00a0 Their pamphlet states, right on the cover, \u201cDesigned by Women / Delivered by Women / For Women Like You.\u201dWhaaaaa?\u00a0 Apparently, I got myself a doctor through a women\u2019s health group without even knowing it!\u00a0 I just have to take a giant step away from this situation and laugh.\u00a0 And laugh and laugh some more.Is this going to be a good fit?\u00a0 I thought it through quite a bit, and decided that I\u2019m going to try it.\u00a0 And I\u2019m going to make my decision based on the doctor, and not the Women thing.\u00a0 Because really, although I am definitely not a woman, I am closer to a woman in some ways, and closer to a man in other ways.\u00a0 And being at this health center is not going to mess with my identity or psyche or ego.As long as they can understand what I am saying to them, as long as they can use my preferred name and male pronouns, and as long as I\u2019m getting good treatment, I will be proud to go here.(And if it doesn\u2019t work out, then it doesn\u2019t work out.)\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 21 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
