This week, we read\u00a0the letters\u00a0of two transgender men who are struggling to find love and acceptance.\u00a0 The Sugars discuss with Cooper Lee Bombardier, a visual artist, writer and transgender man.\u201dAccording to his bio, Cooper \u201chas been a construction worker, a cook, a carpenter, a union stagehand, a welder, a shop steward, a dishwasher, a truckdriver, a bouncer, and a housepainter, among other things, for a paycheck.\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s currently super successful with the writing and the art.\u00a0 He sounds super cool!Steve Almond starts off talking about the first time he met a trans-woman.\u00a0 It was slightly cringe-inducing, but also definitely a worthwhile story.\u00a0 Then they get into the letters, and introduce Cooper.\u00a0 He, as a guest, is eloquent and upbeat, but he does keep it pretty basic, and seems somewhat detached from his own personal stories.\u00a0 There is a really great moment though where Cooper says he\u2019s been \u201ctransitioning\u201d for about 15\u00a0 years, and when the Sugars ask him how old he was when he started, he says, \u201cin my early 30s.\u201d\u00a0 They sputter about how young he looks and how could this be?\u00a0 And he replies, \u201cI moisturize.\u201d\u00a0 And then later, \u201cIt\u2019s the trans-fountain of youth, you know\u2026\u201d and there\u2019s lots of laughing, and Cheryl says, \u201cSign me up!\u201dOne thing that Cooper says really well in discussing the first letter is,\u201cWe wrestle with these feelings for so long, that by the time we articulate it to somebody, it\u2019s like a bottle bursting open.\u00a0 \u2026And we tell our parents and we expect them to get it, like, tomorrow.\u00a0 Even though we\u2019ve been struggling with it for years and years, right?\u00a0 And so I think that\u2026 it\u2019s really hard to be patient when we\u2019ve waited so long to kind of actualize and realize that this is what\u2019s going on for us.\u00a0 But for those relationships that we do want to bring along with us, we do need to offer some patience, even though it\u2019s hard.\u201dWhen discussing the second letter, they telescope it out, to bring it to the wider theme of anyone who feels like they are unloveable, and how to change that internal notion.\u00a0 Cheryl says, \u201cThis is a universal conundrum.\u00a0 \u2026Am I too fat to be loved? No. Am I too poor to be loved? No. Am I too fill-in-the-blank to be loved? No.\u201d\u00a0 They touch on how his height and his career might factor into this, and no one makes one further mention about the fact that he does not have a penis.\u00a0 Is it because they think it\u2019s not important to talk about?\u00a0 No, I kind of doubt it \u2013 I think they are finding it too awkward to address.\u00a0 And/or, in being respectful, they feel that it\u2019s not up to them to talk about a trans-person\u2019s genitalia (or sex life, or surgeries, or\u2026) which is definitely important that we\u2019ve gotten that far, but in this case, it was right there, in the letter, and it just got straight up ignored.I do really hope they expand the dialogue about what it feels like to be a transgender person.\u00a0 I have been thinking of writing in, for a while now, and I only feel more motivated after listening to this.\u00a0 I\u2019m planning on it; I\u2019ll let you know.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
