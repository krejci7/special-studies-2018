path I would follow for coming out at work.\u00a0 First, I would tell a few people in person, including the principal and my supervisor.\u00a0 Then I would talk to the principal about my plan for coming out to everyone else, and make sure that it was fine by her.\u00a0 This plan entailed writing an email to the school requesting male pronouns and a name change.\u00a0 And maybe a brief explanation about how I feel about my gender.\u00a0 Then I would try to be alert and correct people in the moment so that the adjustment period would move along quicker.\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019d actually feel closer to certain people during this process.\u00a0 Currently, I am far away from almost everyone.Paths often diverge into other directions, or gradually end or loop back around.\u00a0 I made it through quite a few of these steps, and each time, I felt an urgency to move ahead, and relief and pride for disclosing more about myself:A little over a year ago, I came out to the principal of my school (workplace).Then, about 5 months ago, I cam out to the head of the kitchen.Four months ago, I came out to my co-worker.Most recently, about 3 months ago, I came out to my supervisor.I thought my supervisor was the major road block.\u00a0 That once that was taken care of, the rest would happen quickly and effortlessly.\u00a0 Because it seemed to be what I had been wanting for years.\u00a0 I wanted to tell all these people, I thought, so that I could move on to the next stage.\u00a0 But now I\u2019m starting to think differently.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if maybe I wanted to tell these people because I actually wanted them to know this thing about me, and not just as a means to get to the next thing.\u00a0 Because as soon as the euphoria of telling my supervisor wore off, the urge to move forward surprisingly died down.\u00a0 Currently I feel no desire to follow the next step(s) in my plan.I could speculate as to why that is:\u00a0 The rest of the plan is too scary, so I\u2019m tricking myself into believing I don\u2019t really want it.\u00a0 This seems unlikely because emailing the rest of the school and then replying in the moment seems totally do-able if that\u2019s what I want.\u00a0 Doing that stuff is so much more hands-off, and low key, as compared to coming out to someone face-to-face, especially if you don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll react.Another guess:\u00a0 I\u2019m worried that people won\u2019t understand.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t legally changed my name yet, and I do not plan on changing my gender marker on legal documents.\u00a0 I also don\u2019t plan on using the men\u2019s room.\u00a0 (Luckily there are 3 \u201cstaff\u201d restrooms within the school.)\u00a0 Will people be confused by my \u201cpartial\u201d or \u201cselective\u201d transition?\u00a0 I\u2019ve talked a lot about this in therapy over time, and I keep getting assured that people will take what I say at face value, and I don\u2019t need to over-explain.\u00a0 I always thought about using a quip about bathrooms in my mass email:\u00a0 \u201cAlthough I use the women\u2019s restroom, don\u2019t worry \u2013 I will continue to clean them all.\u201d\u00a0 Or something like that.\u00a0 If people don\u2019t understand that I am not transitioning into manhood, then so be it, right?Another guess:\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019ve actually reached the balance I\u2019m looking for.\u00a0 Maybe I don\u2019t actually want to be called by my new name, and male pronouns in all areas of my life because my gender is not that binary \u2013 maybe I actually need a little bit of both.\u00a0 This seems possible\u2026 I guess that time will tell.Or:\u00a0 I am focused on my upcoming top surgery right now, that other gender-related issues are on the back burner.\u00a0 This might be the case.\u00a0 Again, time will tell.Above all, when following any transition path, whether it\u2019s laid out in stories in mass media, or the WPATH-SOC, or a therapist, or within each of us, it\u2019s essential to listen to that heart/gut combination voice.\u00a0 Not the voice inside your head.\u00a0 Not the voice of peers transitioning.\u00a0 Not the voice of medical professionals.Sometimes it\u2019s like there is one roadblock in otherwise wide-open terrainother times it\u2019s like finding yourself suddenly where you\u2019ve never beensometimes it\u2019s coming across something completely unexpectedThat voice that says, \u201cthis feels right,\u201d or \u201cthis does not feel right,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not sure about this yet so I\u2019m going to slow down and/or try a different path for a while.\u201d\u00a0 This voice always has a simple message, and it\u2019s always there, even if it seems buried by other, less important voices.\u00a0 Sometimes it\u2019s a complex process to try and figure out what you want to do with that voice\u2019s message, but the message itself is always simple and straightforward.My voice unexpectedly told me that it\u2019s not time to come out to everyone at work right now, if ever.\u00a0 At a time when I was sure my voice was going to say, \u201cfull speed ahead!\u00a0 You\u2019re almost there!\u201d it actually did a 180.\u00a0 And, although a part of me wants to just complete a task that has been on my mind for years, it is much more satisfying to listen to this voice than to check off one more thing on my transition to-do list.Speaking of to-do lists, here\u2019s one version of my transition to-do list, from almost 2 years ago: Gender identity related \u201cto-do list\u201dThere have been many, many versions of this, with lots of revisions.\u00a0 That\u2019s part of what it means to be on a path\u2026\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
