"Last week in therapy, I talked briefly about planning ahead for top surgery one day.\u00a0 I said that I might want to do this, maybe as early as this coming summer.\u00a0 That\u2019s the most concrete thing I\u2019ve ever said about the subject.\u00a0 She asked what some first steps would be, and I replied, \u201clook into whether it would be covered by my insurance.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s kinda something that would really help frame it in my mind, the answer to that\u2026\u00a0 She asked me how I\u2019d do that, and I really floundered with the actual words I would use if I were for real making a phone call to insurance people.It\u2019s too sensitive and too hypothetical in my mind still, and I could barely even say, \u201cfemale to male chest reconstruction surgery\u201d out loud, just to her.\u00a0 She got it and said, \u201cwhat you could do is find out the code for that type of surgery, and when you make the call, you can just ask about the code as opposed to using the words.\u201d\u00a0 I said, ok, yes, I think I could do that.\u00a0 She said she would look it up for me and email me the code.She ended up finding out a ton more info than just the code, on her own.\u00a0 She said certain info led to more questions and she ended up just calling.\u00a0 Basically, she got all the information for me, for which I am so grateful because it would have felt too emotional for me to do on my own, at this time.\u00a0 It is NOT covered by insurance.\u00a0 I\u2019m not surprised.\u00a0 I told her that doesn\u2019t change much \u2013 I\u2019m still considering it.We briefly talked about it again this week, and about gender identity in general.\u00a0 She said that some surgeons require a diagnosis of gender dysphoria for X amount of time in advance (glad she is doing the relevant research!), and should she be diagnosing me with that?\u00a0 This turned into a heated discussion (on my end), with the conclusion that I do not care about that, but I am OK with that, if it\u2019s in order to help along a process.\u00a0 And that, again, I don\u2019t really care to know what she is doing in that regard.The idea of being diagnosed with a mental health label is contentious in my mind, and she knows this.\u00a0 She gets it.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be writing about this further in my next blog post, probably next week.\u00a0 A teaser for what is to come:\u00a0 I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 17, and held onto that belief strongly for about 6 or so years.\u00a0 That\u2019s a heavy duty label to be grappling with, unnecessarily.My therapist is not a gender therapist, but she is doing right by me more than any other therapist I\u2019ve ever had (and some have been gender therapists).\u00a0 There was a time where I thought \u2013 we both thought \u2013 I would need to go to a different therapist in order to progress with any medical transition steps (I did this in order to access testosterone, kinda unnecessarily in the end).\u00a0 I don\u2019t think that anymore.\u00a0 Why can\u2019t she be that person?\u00a0 I think she is getting on board with, she can be that person.\u00a0 We concluded recently that a big goal for therapy is to make some progress with transgender-related issues and decisions, and I said I would send her some more general information to get her started.\u00a0 I sent her the following resources:Genderqueers, Gender Rebels, and OtherWise in the National Transgender Discrimination SurveyTrans Research Blog \u2013 a compilation of what is out thereTrans Bodies, Trans Selves \u2013 a great book to have on handAnyone have other essential resources?More than once, she has said, where is the data?\u00a0 Where is the research that says this and this and this are best practices?\u00a0 And I just keep responding, There needs to be more research.\u00a0 And I just keep shrugging.\u00a0 IT DOES NOT EXIST.\u00a0 (Yet.)\u00a0 I don\u2019t know whether she believed me initially, but she may be starting to realize it by now.\u00a0 It\u2019s maddening how little is out there.Do I think that I have gender dysphoria?\u00a0 Whoa.\u00a0 That is going to take way too long to pull apart right now.\u00a0 That\u2019s probably for a future post!\u00a0 Do I mind being diagnosed with that for the purposes of having a wider selection of surgeons to choose from if I do decide to move forward with top surgery?\u00a0 Not at all!\u00a0 It\u2019s close enough.\u00a0 (Although I do strongly, strongly wish more surgeons would get on board with the informed consent model.)Edit:\u00a0 Now that I think about it, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve already been diagnosed with gender dysphoria by my primary care physician (for my testosterone prescription) and probably at least one other therapist.\u00a0 To me, it all feels so arbitrary.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 16 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
