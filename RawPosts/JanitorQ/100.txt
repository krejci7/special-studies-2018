Kale is the one wearing the hat.And I guess I should start by saying that though I\u2019m not experiencing any noticeable changes specifically from T, I have definitely noticed changes in my overall well-being from the moment I decided that I was ready to start taking T. It was kinda like this relief that, well, things might start to make more sense soon. So, I\u2019m genderqueer, I have started calling my gender \u201cconfusion\u201d, the act of feeling comfortable when people do not see me as male or female but instead are confused by my gender presentations. In my dream world children always ask me if I\u2019m a boy or a girl and adults give me weird looks and avoid using pronouns for me. For the past two years I\u2019ve gone by Kale and have used they/them pronouns when I feel like I can express that desire to others (I have a really hard time with coming out as GQ). In those two years I have increasingly struggled with who I am.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
