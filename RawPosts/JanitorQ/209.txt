I don\u2019t have much to report! 2. I plan on this being a long term endeavor, both this blog, and the actual taking of the testosterone.\u00a0 So, I mean, I can\u2019t foresee the future, but I imagine I\u2019ll be around 4 years from now, 6 years from now, updating about T-changes every once in a while.\u00a0 I do want to document the long term here.To summarize, I started using 1.62% of Androgel, 1.25g / day.\u00a0 After 2 months, I was getting concerned with the changes I was seeing (however slight they were), so I asked to be lowered to 1%.\u00a0 And have not seen any further changes since then.\u00a0 I have been highly motivated to continue applying the gel every day.\u00a0 For about 6 days early on, I was alternating days (my doctor\u2019s suggestion) in an attempt to slow progress, and I did not enjoy this skipping of days at all!\u00a0 Since then I have not missed a day.I have been experiencing some incredible internal changes due to the added testosterone in my body.\u00a0 Some were expected (and were the reasons for me to seek it out) and some were a complete surprise. 1. Increased sex-drive (expected) 2. Increased sensitivity to pain, and all physical sensations, actually (surprise) 3. Increased connectedness with my body, decreased gender dysphoria (not totally a surprise) 4. Decreased general anxiety, big time (surprise)I don\u2019t have any voice recordings or even very many photos, which is partially due to not being tech savvy (I\u2019m trying to learn little by little here), and partially a tactic I\u2019m employing to help myself not obsess too much.\u00a0 But I do realize it means I don\u2019t have much \u201cproof.\u201d\u00a0 *I\u2019m thinking about making a video at my one year mark.\u00a0 Maybe.\u00a0 If I can figure out how to do that.I do have these pictures of my face though.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see myself looking more masculine (yet) but maybe I am getting there, very very slowly\u2026\u00a0 Will just have to wait to find out\u2026five monthseight monthseleven monthseleven months and one day\u00a0These last 2 photos are sort of to illustrate how we can look pretty different, just from day to day, from photo to photo.\u00a0 I could spend hours taking photos of myself and most of them I\u2019d probably look at and say, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t even look like me!\u201d\u00a0 (Luckily I didn\u2019t do that \u2013 it\u2019s sort of a rush job.\u00a0 Also, do I think I look like myself?\u00a0 Not sure.)*\u00a0 It\u2019s not a goal of mine to prove anything in particular (such as, that taking T long-term without masculinizing changes is possible).\u00a0 But if I find that this is possible, I\u2019ll continue to be very very happy!\u00a0 My main goal is to be out there with a different perspective.\u00a0 A different set of reasons for having started testosterone, and a different set of reasons for wanting to continue.\u00a0 And to see what happens along the way.\u00a0 And to talk with people about it!\u00a0 (OK, so that was more like a 5 part goal.)\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 21 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
