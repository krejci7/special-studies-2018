was out of work initially for 2 weeks, then I went back for about a month before being out for another 2 weeks.\u00a0 I started to feel like things were improving \u2013 it was starting to be spring, time was on my side, and I would have moments where the crushing depression was lifting.Then I had a really rough few days last week.\u00a0 I had 2 nights of disturbed sleeping in a row, and that really made the difference in whether I was OK enough or not OK.\u00a0 I called into work one of the days, but that started to not feel like enough.\u00a0 Things at work were starting to really trigger my anxiety, and this just got worse and worse over the weekend.I had an idea about the trajectory of my recovery, but my brain is not following along.\u00a0 I thought, \u201cOK, I just went through a manic episode with delusional thinking.\u00a0 This was followed by about 2 weeks of hypomania and then some mixed symptoms.\u00a0 I thought I could get away without sinking into depression, but it caught up to me.\u00a0 I should be in this depression for a few weeks and then things will start to lift and I\u2019ll feel like myself again.\u201dThose few weeks have been stretching into 2 months so far.\u00a0 Like I said, a couple weeks ago, it started to feel like things were improving a little bit, but then I fell again, fast and hard.\u00a0 That wasn\u2019t part of the plan.\u00a0 My therapist suggested going out of work for even longer, to give myself some time to heal.\u00a0 So, I am currently out of work for a month.\u00a0 It feels like defeat/relief.\u00a0 I started taking Celexa in the hopes that it will help.Some of those nights when I haven\u2019t been sleeping well have been agony.\u00a0 There were nights where I didn\u2019t actually sleep at all \u2013 just kind of dozed only to be pulled out of it by some thought attached to an anxiety-reaction, over and over and over again.\u00a0 Does anyone else go through periods of insomnia?\u00a0 I kept trying to go to sleep in the guest bed, then switch to the couch, then back to our bed, then the guest bed, the couch, our bed, the guest bed\u2026\u00a0 The night stretched out to infinity.\u00a0 I started getting agitated.\u00a0 Pacing.\u00a0 Swearing at myself.\u00a0 Punching a soft chair.\u00a0 I could have done worse, so I\u2019m glad it was just that.I\u2019m at a new low.\u00a0 When I thought recovery was on the horizon, I sunk lower.\u00a0 In my past, I have been more depressed than I am right now, but who\u2019s comparing?\u00a0 This feels pretty fucking bad.When my feelings were so bad I didn\u2019t think I could even be with myself, my partner helped me arrange to spend the day with her mom.\u00a0 We went to the bank, got coffee, ran an errand at the mall, she brought me to my therapy appointment, and then we had lunch at her house.\u00a0 That helped.When it wasn\u2019t any better 2 days later, I called a friend and she picked me up on her way to doing a bunch of deliveries for work.\u00a0 We ate lunch at an Indian buffet.\u00a0 That helped.When I couldn\u2019t imagine being home alone anymore, I went to yoga with my partner.\u00a0 That helped.When I couldn\u2019t fathom what I would do with these unstructured days, I looked into a place called the Creative Wellness Center.\u00a0 They have a bunch of art workshops and support groups, and it\u2019s all free.\u00a0 I went to a jewelery making workshop just because that was what was being offered when I got there, and I went to a support group.\u00a0 That helped, momentarily, but I would have to say the social element was super taxing, and I\u2019m not sure if I will go back.When I expressed extreme despondency in therapy today, she suggested a partial hospitalization program.\u00a0 She looked into it and they do currently have openings.\u00a0 It runs weekdays from 9:30-3:15.\u00a0 I think this is what I need right now.\u00a0 She is going to fill out the paperwork and get back to me \u2013 I may be able to start next week.In brighter news, my partner and I adopted 2 cats two weeks ago.\u00a0 Their names are Joan (after Joan Jett) and Jarboe (singer in a band called Swans).\u00a0 Normally, getting new pets would probably be exciting and fun.\u00a0 There are elements that are nice \u2013 it\u2019s fun to watch them play together, and I like when they are cuddly.\u00a0 But to be honest, it has been stressful, just because of the state I am in.\u00a0 They are cats, doing their cat things.\u00a0 They get into stuff and knock things over.\u00a0 They eat things they shouldn\u2019t.\u00a0 We\u2019re containing them to the first floor right now, and Joan keeps getting through to go to the upstairs or basement. They are a whirlwind of motion; they are creatures being alive.Joan\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jarboe\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I keep hoping that they will save me from what I am feeling, but the best they can do is distract me momentarily.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot of pressure I\u2019m putting on them!\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
