all 3 days for the first time ever, which allowed us to space out our time differently \u2013 not spend the entire day there and feel burn-out, yet still get to a lot of workshops.This post is going to have a lot of links because lots of exciting things are going on!I met some people!\u00a0 I got to meet Jamie, Lesboi, and Captain Glittertoes.\u00a0 I also saw Nathan again after meeting him last year \u2013 he\u2019s putting together an anthology through Transgress Press called Voices of Transgender Parents.\u00a0 If you know anyone who is a trans-parent, direct them here to find out more:\u00a0 Call for Submissions.\u00a0 I met someone named Elliott (if you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019d love to connect online but am not sure how to find you\u2026)\u00a0 It\u2019s a surreal and rare experience to meet someone who\u2019s blog you\u2019ve been reading for a long time, especially if you have no idea what they look like in real life!Here\u2019s a breakdown of the workshops I attended and a brief summary of what I got out of them:Non-Binary Talk:\u00a0 Let\u2019s Make Friends \u2013 This was an informal space for people to share their experiences and connect by raising their hands and taking turns.\u00a0 The room was packed!\u00a0 It was really hard to hear a lot of what people said, and unfortunately no one suggested using the microphone on hand.\u00a0 Someone near me said something I\u2019d never heard before \u2013 they said they identify as demi-gender, meaning their gender expression matches their gender assigned at birth, they just don\u2019t totally feel that way internally.Below the Belt:\u00a0 A Frank Discussion of Trans Male Genitalia \u2013 This workshop was led by Trystan Cotten, the founder of Transgress Press.\u00a0 He led the room in generating a long list of topics and concerns, and then we picked a few to discuss further.\u00a0 There was a huge range in what was brought up \u2013 it was only minimally about genital surgeries.\u00a0 We talked about hysterectomies and the options within that, reproductive issues, how trans-men relate to or don\u2019t relate to their junk, menstruation, etc.\u00a0 It was really well organized and facilitated.Results from the TransYouth Family Allies Research (TYFA) Study \u2013 This is a groundbreaking collection of data that illuminates what\u2019s going on for trans-youth and their families.\u00a0 Unfortunately, I walked in late and missed the segment talking about the results, but another blog writer sums it up here:\u00a0 Results from TYFA study.\u00a0 I did learn that another survey is in the works to glean more information.\u00a0 The first online survey was 117 parents, mostly white moms (only 6 dads).\u00a0 They are planning both a longitudinal follow-up from the first study, and also a 2nd cohort to touch on gender fluidity and non-binary identities, delve further into self-harm and suicidality, and harassment and discrimination.The Rebirth of Paris Documentary \u2013 A very well done update of where the ballroom scene has been and is currently, since Paris is Burning.\u00a0 Directed by Seven King.The Future of Gender Queer \u2013 This was the first of two non-binary-related workshops that I went to, one right after the other.\u00a0 They were very different.\u00a0 This one was moderated by Ignacio Rivera, who I look up to as someone doing amazing research in the field of non-binary identities.\u00a0 Last year, I was blown away by their presentation of \u201cA Gender Not Listed Here.\u201d\u00a0 They are currently working on a 2nd, follow-up survey at the National Center for Transgender Equality.\u00a0 It is going to be available mid August at\u00a0http://www.ustranssurvey.org/\u00a0 We should all take this survey!\u00a0 They led a panel with two other people, but also made sure to get lots of audience participation.\u00a0 We started by mapping out our individual gender journeys over the years, divided by how we felt vs. how we were perceived by the world.\u00a0 We then meandered through how we felt as genderqueer people, navigating the world, by raising our hands and speaking as one big group (with the help of a microphone this time).\u00a0 Feels like we only touched on what could be talked about.Non-Binary (In)visibility:\u00a0 Empowerment and Self-Determination: \u2013 This was facilitated very differently and was more of a self-exploration and small-group sharing workshop.\u00a0 These can sometimes feel intimidating (talking to strangers in small groups), but I felt fine and liked my group.\u00a0 We first wrote down three ways we celebrate and share our non-binary identity in the world, and we also wrote 10 different answers to \u201cWho am I?\u201d\u00a0 We were then prompted to cross out 3 of them, then another 3, then another 3.\u00a0 At this point we got into small groups and talked about how we determined which ones to cross out and which one was left.\u00a0 We also did \u201c2 truths and a lie\u201d based on how we present ourselves or would like to present ourselves if we could.\u00a0 We wrapped up with discussing ways we can sustain support in our own communities after leaving the conference.\u00a0 Some of this felt a little self-indulgent and 101-ish, but the small group discussions really made it worthwhile.I am the T: an FTM Documentary \u2013 This is an ongoing project to film 10 FTM people in 10 different countries.\u00a0 The film crew presented a rough cut of the first segment, Isak from Norway.\u00a0 It was really well done and I can\u2019t wait to see more from this project.\u00a0 After the first film is complete, they have plans to continue with trans-feminine experiences and non-binary experiences from around the world.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013
