Between Saturday AM and Wednesday AM, I was in the hospital for mental health reasons, on a psychiatric unit. I don\u2019t believe I ever thought I\u2019d be back there; in fact, it was my biggest fear. Scarier than heights, the tallest roller-coasters, the dark, spiders, sharks, germs, etc. etc. (I\u2019m actually not afraid of any of those things.)Just to summarize my history briefly, when I was a senior in high school, I suffered a psychotic break and subsequent major depressive episode (lasting 4 months, and then on and off throughout college). I was on a mixture of different drugs for about 6 years, and I weened myself off all of them after a certain point. I\u2019d been med-free for roughly 10 years, and pretty proud of that fact.I\u2019ve written about mental health before\u2026 Here: Depression and taking testosterone Here: That specific trauma is still there And here: Continuing to work through a specific trauma \u2026and also scattered throughout many blog entries.Although this blog is mainly about taking a low dose of T and working as a janitor, it is undeniably also about mental health and self-care. I slipped up pretty big in the self-care department, slowly and gradually at first, and then fast and unstoppably. I went through a full blown manic episode / psychotic break. A lot of it was so fun it\u2019s kinda indescribable. In fact, I can definitely tell I still haven\u2019t come down completely yet \u2013 I\u2019m registering a heightened sensitivity to bodily sensations, both pleasant and annoying, I feel keyed up / antsy, I need to be in control of the stimulation levels or else I feel overwhelmed within seconds, smells and tastes are waaaaay off (not constantly, but sporadically), colors and patterns are popping out, my thinking is still relatively disorganized\u2026But I\u2019m sleeping well and eating well and engaging in a lot of different things and spending 24/7 with my partner for a few days, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important right now. I was prescribed ziprasidone, which is an atypical antipsychotic approved by the FDA in 2001. Am I happy about it? No. Do I think I\u2019ll be on it indefinitely? A strong NO! But I can accept it for right now.I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll return to some of what I went through, in an attempt to process things and just share where I\u2019m at (it does feel like it\u2019ll be an arduous rehabilitation process, and I\u2019ll be out of work for roughly 2 weeks). For now though, I want to just write about a strange parallel. It might not mean anything if you haven\u2019t seen Breaking Bad, but I\u2019ll give it a whirl anyway (and there are no real spoilers in what is to follow):Leading up to what I went through, my partner and I were watching a lot of Breaking Bad.\u00a0 Not really binge watching it, but watching an episode almost every night. Now we are not. Haha. We only have 4 or 5 episodes left, but we\u2019re putting the show on pause. I suggested we start watching Malcolm in the Middle instead, largely because Bryan Cranston plays the dad in both shows (and I used to watch it as a teenager and thought it would be fun. It is fun). But \u2013 we just watched the 5th episode, and the family is getting their house tented and fumigated.\u00a0 They are in a camper trailer on their front lawn in the meantime. And the parents, at the tail end of the episode, put on gas masks in order to enter the house and get some alone time. I was flipping out. (I mean, my partner was too, but I was shouting and swearing and pacing and called it a night, basically). Haha. I\u2019ll probably be in bed by 9pm.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
