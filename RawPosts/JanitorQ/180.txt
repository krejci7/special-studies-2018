These documents play an essential, functional role, but also demonstrate the measure of dignity and respect afforded to our nation\u2019s citizens. We cannot overstate the care and seriousness that should be brought to bear on the issue.We recognize the importance of gender identification in particular and the Obama Administration is working to modernize federal policies in this area. For example, in 2010, the U.S. Department of State made it easier for individuals to update the gender marker in their passports. And last year, the Social Security Administration followed suit by simplifying the process for individuals to change the gender marker on their social security cards to reflect their identity accurately.As you can imagine, there is considerable variance across agencies and levels of government. And so while the Obama Administration wants to make sure that official documents reflect the identities of the Americans who hold them, we believe proposals to change when and how gender is listed on official documents should be considered on a case-by-case basis by the affected federal and state agencies. However, that consideration must be informed by best practices and a commitment to honoring individuality and ensuring fairness.So, it sounds like a polite, \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 If you want to read the entirety, it is here:\u00a0 We the People Petition on Non-Binary Genders.\u00a0 In this world of constant feedback loops, you can also let the government know what you think of their response, share on Facebook and Twitter, etc.Personally, this is the thing I want the most.\u00a0 In my two previous posts, I explained that although I identify strongly with being non-binary, I actually am not strongly bothered by gendered pronouns (I prefer male pronouns) or gendered bathrooms (I use the women\u2019s bathroom).\u00a0 In general, I attempt to mix and match gendered options to optimize my comfort level, and that has usually worked for me.\u00a0 But when it comes to declaring, \u201cI am male\u201d\u00a0 or \u201cI am female,\u201d I simply cannot do it.\u00a0 Legally, I am female, simply because it is the default in this case.\u00a0 I would not seriously consider legally changing my gender unless I can change it to a gender-neutral option (and if I could, I would do it ASAP).\u00a0 Legal stuff feels like a more black and white, either/or arena than bathrooms, pronouns, and anything else in the real world which is comparatively flexible and fluid.\u00a0 What I mean by this is, for example, I like when people say,\u201dsir,\u201d \u201cman,\u201d and use male pronouns because they\u2019re seeing me, we\u2019re interacting, and that interaction has the potential of being nuanced, fluid, changing.\u00a0 I could walk in the women\u2019s bathroom today, and tomorrow decide to go in the men\u2019s, without too much consequence (hopefully) if I wanted or needed to.The legality of being one gender or another seems so much more finite, set-in-stone, weighty.\u00a0 And I want another option!!!!!\u00a0 People in Australia, as of a few months ago, are able to pursue a \u201cnon-specific\u201d designation.\u00a0 I want to be able to as well!\u00a0 (Although, I didn\u2019t realize this until looking into it just now, but Australian citizens pursuing this must present medical proof of gender confirmation surgery.\u00a0 It would be important, ultimately, for medical transition status to not play any part in this designation \u2013 just my very very strong opinion.)Until I have this option, I will continue to evade declaring my gender as often as I can.\u00a0 I will continue to leave it blank on forms whenever possible, and to explain the nuance if the opportunity arises.\u00a0 As of now, if my gender is not listed on a form, my (very feminine) legal name will immediately give me away anyway.\u00a0 So although I have no plans to legally become male, I do plan to legally change my name to something ambiguous.\u00a0 And as soon as I start hearing about smaller instances where a \u201cnon-specific,\u201d \u201cnon-binary,\u201d \u201cX,\u201d or whatever the term may be, is a possible option, I will start pursuing it.\u00a0 Even if that means I\u2019m listed as \u201cF,\u201d on some things and \u201cX\u201d or whatever on others.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to start on a small scale (like doctor office forms, maybe things like library card applications, etc.)\u00a0 It\u2019s already started!\u00a0 And just build and build from there.\u00a0 All the way up to driver\u2019s license, passport, and birth certificate.\u00a0 One day, I hope\u2026\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
