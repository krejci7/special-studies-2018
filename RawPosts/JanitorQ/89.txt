seems to be working out for him.Ryka Aoki De La Cruz is a LA based writer, performer, and professor (at Antioch and Santa Monica College).\u00a0 She is super active in the trans-community.\u00a0 Among a huge resume of accomplishments, she\u00a0has been honored by the California State Senate for for her \u201cextraordinary commitment to free speech and artistic expression, as well as the visibility and well-being of Transgender people.\u201dJessica Xavier is from the Washington D.C. area and is an accomplished activist first and foremost.\u00a0 She came out as trans in 1989, and fronted a band called Me Neither, wrote a song about Stonewall.\u00a0 This link is a super dated website from 2004, but it\u2019s got a lot of biographic information\u2026Ryka Aoki De La CruzThe Shondes were formed in 2006, right as this film was being made.\u00a0 Since then, looks like their music has been blowing up \u2013 their website (link) is super active \u2013 full of photos, tour information, press, tweets, etc.\u00a0 This is another band that recently toured with Against Me!
