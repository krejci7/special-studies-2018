the most unromantic love note ever.\u00a0 That\u2019s OK.\u00a0 That\u2019s us!\u00a0 \u2026We have been together for close to 8 years now.\u00a0 We lived together before we \u201cgot together.\u201d\u00a0 We met as housemates, which was kinda an interesting way to get to know someone (if you\u2019re considering asking them out) in terms of feeling out potential compatibility.\u00a0 A more detailed version of how we got together is here, if you\u2019re interested:\u00a0 Happy Randomtimes, today.Last fall, we got legally married, which I had a lot of mixed feelings about.\u00a0 It boils down to:\u00a0 We got married for health insurance purposes (and other legal reasons that seem unclear at this time, but may be super important at later times).\u00a0 We did not get married out of love.\u00a0 Every day we are together, it is out of love.\u00a0 Marriage has absolutely nothing to do with whether we are together or not.\u00a0 It does not mean we are any more or less likely to stay together now.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t mean that anything about how we operate our relationship has changed.\u00a0 Marriage is meaningless.\u00a0 So I guess I\u2019m attempting to bring some meaning into it, because next Saturday, we are celebrating the fact that we got married.I haven\u2019t been in the best place, emotionally, the past few weeks, and that\u2019s been making it feel like a struggle, to plan for this celebration.\u00a0 Which is OK.\u00a0 This party will happen.\u00a0 It\u2019s normal to feel overwhelmed and nervous when planning something so big.\u00a0 Everything does not need to fall into place exactly how we want it to for it to be a good day.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be a good day because we are connecting with people and with each other.\u00a0 And not because the sound system worked without a hitch and no plates or glasses got broken.But there\u2019s kinda more to it than that.\u00a0 We are celebrating marriage, and I\u2019m struggling to understand what marriage is.\u00a0 (Marriage is what you make it.)\u00a0 Almost anything that is traditionally romantic, anything that is a traditional ritual for a wedding day, the roles we play\u2026 I don\u2019t get it.\u00a0 It\u2019s not because I\u2019m a contrarian or I\u2019m \u201ctoo cool for school.\u201d\u00a0 It just does not resonate.\u00a0 I don\u2019t wanna play those games.\u00a0 In general, we won\u2019t be.\u00a0 We\u2019re having a \u201cceremony,\u201d\u00a0 (er, 2 actually, an opening and a closing ceremony) but it will be fairly aberrant, bent, queer, variant, deviant.\u00a0 We have no gift registry.\u00a0 Our photo album is full of pictures of our friends and families.\u00a0 Scrap the scrap book, and the guest book while you\u2019re at it.\u00a0 I could go on\u2026We\u2019re discussing the idea of slow dancing to \u201cEveryday is Halloween,\u201d (Not because we wanna stir shit up, but just because that has been our wake-up alarm song every morning for about 5 years now.)\u00a0 I love all of these ideas, but I\u2019m still not comfortable playing the role of the person who is getting married (or already got married, and is now on display.)\u00a0 In a way, it feels like the party was just an idea a while back, and now has a life of its own.\u00a0 I think collecting some of these thoughts is really going to help me out.So a note, to my partner:Hey, you!\u00a0 I like you a lot.\u00a0 I trust you as much as one person can trust another person.\u00a0 As time goes on, I just keep finding that we are super highly compatible.\u00a0 You give me huge amounts of space and leeway to be myself, to figure out what I want/need, to experiment.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t be in a relationship any other way.\u00a0 I know that I often hold myself back, so I cannot be having someone else also doing that.It feels like we\u2019re generally in-tune, in-synch, we communicate about what is going on, regularly.\u00a0 And if we aren\u2019t, we will be again soon \u2013 I don\u2019t feel left in the dark for long.\u00a0 And if I do, it is not worrisome.\u00a0 We\u2019ll catch up with each other soon enough.\u00a0 I know I\u2019m a difficult person, sometimes.\u00a0 I can be moody, and I generally need a shit-ton of alone time, in order to feel like a person.\u00a0 I make things complicated when they are simple.\u00a0 That\u2019s not easy to live with.\u00a0 You just roll with it.I think that you are so super cool.\u00a0 You are a strong person with values I really admire.\u00a0 You stand up for yourself and for what you think is right.\u00a0 You\u2019re not afraid of confrontation.\u00a0 You mold your life into what you want.\u00a0 We\u2019re molding our lives together, continuously.Love, me.PS- At my most recent therapy appointment, I just kept crying and crying (that I couldn\u2019t do this marriage party thing, basically).\u00a0 She suggested I write on my blog, where I\u2019m comfortable, about it, before I\u2019m in this less-than-comfortable situation.\u00a0 That perked me up.\u00a0 I said, \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good idea.\u201d\u00a0 She replied, \u201cThat might be it for me \u2013 I might not have any more of those; I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\u00a0 I reiterated it was a really good idea.\u00a0 Also, at the end of the appointment, she told me it was a freebie \u2013 a therapist\u2019s version of a wedding gift.\u00a0 Haha.\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
