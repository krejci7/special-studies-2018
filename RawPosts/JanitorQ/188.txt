She was describing a tattoo she was planning on getting.\u00a0 She showed me a picture on her iPhone of the tattoo she wants.\u00a0 We discussed tattoos at length.\u00a0 I told her all about my partner\u2019s tattoos, and about how her brother is a tattoo artist.\u00a0 Finally, I told her I have a tattoo.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t act surprised or ask to see it (she knows I scare easily, haha.)\u00a0 At a later time, she again brought up her plans to get a tattoo.\u00a0 I took that opportunity to show her mine, which is located below my right clavicle.\u00a0 She was nonchalant and didn\u2019t ask what it is or what it means.\u00a0 And I didn\u2019t tell her, but it felt like I could have, which is new.What it is:\u00a0 It\u2019s the trans* symbol, except it\u2019s disassembled and rearranged (I came up with the idea long before I got the tattoo).\u00a0 I guess it just means that I\u2019ve felt simultaneously connected and disconnected from identifying as transgender, for a very long time.\u00a0 I feel that the term is accurate in describing me, but it also feels splintered, fractured / I feel disengaged.\u00a0 If she had asked, I wouldn\u2019t have said this exactly; I\u2019m not sure what I would have told her!2. On Wednesday, this town\u2019s worst shock jock radio hosts Kimberly and Beck were suspended indefinitely from their radio station, after making hateful comments against the transgender community.\u00a0 There was such an outpouring as a result, that they were fired by Entercom Radio on Thursday morning.\u00a0 I have my head in such a hole, that I didn\u2019t know anything about it.\u00a0 The head of the kitchen mentioned it to me around lunch-time on Thursday.\u00a0 She showed me the article on her iPhone.\u00a0 (I was super elated by this news.\u00a0 I have strongly disliked Kimberly and Beck for years.\u00a0 I looked it up, and they\u2019ve been on the air, every morning, for 13 years!!!)We discussed how they crossed a line, and how you just don\u2019t say shit like that.\u00a0 I was so close to telling her that I know a lot of transgender people, and that I am transgender.\u00a0 In my head, I got hung up on the part where I tell her how I identify, specifically, I guess because it\u2019s not that straightforward / I want to be taken seriously when I do tell people.\u00a0 So I just let the moment pass, but, again, the potential of it felt new and interesting.\u00a0 Like I could see the conversation starting to formulate, and that\u2019s exciting.Work is like the final frontier, in my head.\u00a0 If I could come out at work, it would be an incredible accomplishment.\u00a0 And this is how I would do it \u2013 start with one person, start with one-on-one conversations, and see what happens.\u00a0 Even though I didn\u2019t get there this week, I will.\u00a0 And more importantly, IGNORANT SHOCK JOCK DJS TALKING SHIT GOT FIRED FOR THEIR SHIT!!!\u00a0 And the radio station seemed to do the right thing every step of the way.\u00a0 They even had two local trans* activists on air to discuss some issues.\u00a0 This is incredible!!!\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 19 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
