\u2013 but so far, so good.)I stopped going to therapy:\u00a0 I have been going to therapy consistently for 4 years.\u00a0 Much of that time was weekly, sometimes we scaled back to every 2 or 3 weeks.\u00a0 The past few times recently, I didn\u2019t know what we were doing / didn\u2019t know what to talk about / we were going in circles.\u00a0 All of a sudden, it occurred to me that maybe I didn\u2019t need to go.\u00a0 And instead of that thought freaking me out, it settled in and felt right.\u00a0 So on Tuesday, I talked to my therapist about it, and she said it sounded like a great idea.\u00a0 We wrapped some things up for now, with little fanfare, and she made sure the door was open if I ever want to go back.\u00a0 I imagine I probably will, but for now, I had just been spinning my wheels, and it feels good to put an end to that.\u00a0 Maybe I can focus more on other areas of my life\u2026Considering how unstable I\u2019ve been for a long time, these are some pretty huge changes.\u00a0 And I am finally starting to look forward to what\u2019s ahead!\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
