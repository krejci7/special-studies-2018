Since I don\u2019t live in Oregon or California, I still have to legally be either \u201cMale\u201d or \u201cFemale.\u201d \u00a0Although I legally changed my name to something more masculine, I opted to remain \u201cfemale,\u201d legally. \u00a0This has led to feelings of dysphoria, but being \u201cmale\u201d would have anyway, as well. \u00a0So, as of a few months ago, I decided to put a bright neon sticker over my \u201cSex\u201d on my driver\u2019s license. \u00a0At first it was neon orange. \u00a0Currently it\u2019s neon green. \u00a0The color doesn\u2019t make too much of a difference \u2013 just the fact that no one can see whether it\u2019s \u201cM\u201d or \u201cF\u201d is huge for me. \u00a0I\u2019ve shown it at the pharmacy, bought beer with it, gotten \u201ccarded\u201d at restaurants, shown it to bouncers at bars and nightclubs. \u00a0No one has commented or had an issue with it \u2013 they just need to know how old I am, and that I am who I say I am! \u00a0That\u2019s it. \u00a0(As an aside, when I traveled abroad, I did take the sticker off, because I didn\u2019t think TSA agents would be too thrilled about that\u2026)2. \u00a0School Pictures I am an elementary school janitor \u2013 every year, I go through the same routines: \u00a0first day of school, winter concerts, spring concerts, curriculum nights, open house, book fair, the 5th grade breakfast, last day of school, etc. \u00a0No one can forget school pictures! \u00a0They happen within the first weeks of school \u2013 this year, it was a week ago, today. \u00a0As a staff member, I have to participate, and then I get some free photos, and I get a sheet of all the faculty and staff, every year. \u00a0In the past, I have gone by the initials that I used to go by, which was \u201cKT\u201d and then [last name]. \u00a0Unless I wasn\u2019t feeling like speaking up (which was the case on a couple of occasions) I made sure the picture company had me down as \u201cKT\u201d instead of \u201cMrs.,\u201d \u201cMs.,\u201d or \u201cMr.\u201d \u00a0This year, surprisingly, I \u201cpassed\u201d as male, as I saw the picture lady write down, \u201cMr.\u201d and then ask me what my last name is. \u00a0Without hesitating, I gave her my last name (new, legally changed), and then said, \u201cCan you change that \u2018Mr.\u2019 to \u2018Mx.\u2019? \u00a0It\u2019s neither \u2018Mr.\u2019 nor \u2018Ms.\u2019 \u201d \u00a0She replied, \u201cI guess I can,\u201d and I watched her cross out what she had and re-write \u201cMx.\u201d \u00a0It was awesome! \u00a0I kinda can\u2019t wait to get my sheet of faculty and staff photos this year.3. \u00a0Playing It By Ear, As I Go This last one is a bit of a contradiction -I\u2019ve resigned myself to the fact that I cannot assert my non-binary identity in every and all cases, so, if people are given a heads-up that I\u2019ve changed my name and pronouns, in some situations, that is good enough. \u00a0Especially at work. \u00a0Teachers have been great about switching over. \u00a0And I honestly don\u2019t know how many of them get the nuances I\u2019ve tried to convey. \u00a0A couple of them for sure, because they asked me questions, and I had some really satisfying conversations. \u00a0But in addition to this, there\u2019s a larger group of people who are slowly hearing about it (or not) by word of mouth \u2013 mainly buildings and grounds workers. \u00a0Electricians, plumbers, HVAC specialists, people I see now and then, but certainly not every day. \u00a0If they get that I am a trans-person, and they are respectful, then, that is good enough. \u00a0There\u2019s this one guy who is over at our school a lot. \u00a0A few weeks ago, he took me aside, and, obviously nervous about the exchange, he said, \u201cSo, I just want to know, because we are friends\u2026 It\u2019s Kameron now?\u201d \u00a0He was just verifying something he wanted to make sure he was getting right, and, in my eyes, I was really psyched about this because he\u2019s a guy that I think other workers look up to. \u00a0So, the more positivity around it, the better. \u00a0The less nasty gossip behind my back, the better. \u00a0And, to that end, I just went to a union meeting two days ago, and the secretary addressed me by my old moniker, \u201cKT.\u201d \u00a0I almost didn\u2019t correct her, because\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 the picking your battles thing, I guess. \u00a0BUT! \u00a0Someone else corrected her, someone that I didn\u2019t know knew yet! \u00a0And so, I riffed off of that, asserting, \u201cYep, it\u2019s Kameron now. \u00a0I changed my name.\u201d \u00a0She shrunk into herself at hearing that, but, whatever. \u00a0Another buildings and grounds guy took it from there, telling me loudly that his \u201cniece\u201d just transitioned recently into his \u201cnephew.\u201d \u00a0We sat down and continued to converse so that anyone and everyone could hear, if they tuned in. \u00a0He was just overjoyed to be accepting \u201cShane,\u201d his middle-school-aged family member. \u00a0 At no point did I try to assert that I was neither male nor female. \u00a0If he got the gist that I am trans, and he spreads the word with a positive attitude, then that is better than good enough. \u00a0Acceptance, even if limited in understanding, is still worth it!\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
