one day at a time.So by midweek, I decided to take the risk and share my news.\u00a0 I wondered, how many people would I have to tell before they start spreading the word and I don\u2019t have to do the work anymore?\u00a0 I guessed 5.\u00a0 In the end, I surpassed that goal of 5, and told 10 (and I\u2019m still telling people)!\u00a0 And the word did start to get around; people were coming up to me and congratulating me.\u00a0 People were gushing with excitement and wanting me to bring in pictures for them to see.\u00a0 People had all kinds of questions about what we were going to do.\u00a0 I got a card from the whole school with a gift card in it.\u00a0 The first grade teachers pitched in and gave me a gift basket.\u00a0 It was as if my dark and dreary, mysterious and reserved, shy and distant demeanor at work got a huge boost, and I\u2019ve been trying to run with that.I could be a totally new person at work (slowly, little by little)!\u00a0 I even took my hat off!\u00a0 (I\u2019ve been wearing military style caps every day as long as I\u2019ve worked there, and it was getting old \u2013 I was tired of hats, but I couldn\u2019t seem to get myself to take it off.\u00a0 Now?\u00a0 It seemed like no problem!\u00a0 Hat gone!)\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 23 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
