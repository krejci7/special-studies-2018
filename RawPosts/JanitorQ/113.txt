I\u2019d like to learn more about this.\u201dAfter that, I never really looked back, re-evaluated my identity, or hesitated to call myself trans.\u00a0 Even when some friends around me started to shift from identifying as \u201cgenderqueer,\u201d to identifying as \u201cFTM\u201d and started transitioning.\u00a0 Even when I was the only one in this support group who was not actively transitioning or planning to ASAP.\u00a0 Even when I attended a social group called \u201cGuys\u2019 Night Out\u201d despite not being sure I was \u201cone of the guys.\u201d\u00a0 They were all trans, and I also was (am) trans.I\u2019ve gone to a handful of local trans-related events, some political, some social, and some creative.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t walked away feeling an affinity with the people in the space, but that really has nothing to do with gender identity.\u00a0 My inability to connect with other trans people in real life is not because I\u2019m not trans enough.\u00a0 It\u2019s because I\u2019m not social enough.\u00a0 I wish I could connect more, but I\u2019m not pushing myself right now.I am very secure in my transhood.However, when you throw societal views into the mix, it gets tricky (sticky, icky).\u00a0 The biggest example of this for me is work.\u00a0 If I were trans enough, I would be out at work, and I would transition.\u00a0 It would be difficult, but it\u2019d be relatively straightforward.\u00a0 Since I\u2019m in this in-between land (which I strongly feel is where I fit), I\u2019m in this limbo at work (and out in public as well).\u00a0 I have come out to the principal of my school (workplace), but have made no further efforts.\u00a0 Because I do not feel trans enough to ask for changes.I just feel like typing that again \u2013 I do not feel trans enough to ask for changes, at work or in public.\u00a0 No one at work uses my preferred name or pronouns.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t asked them to.\u00a0 My friends and community are behind me 100% \u2013 everyone has been amazing with my recent social name change.\u00a0 Family is trickier, but they all do know.\u00a0 What do I do about work though?\u00a0 Maybe I wait till I have legally changed my name.\u00a0 Maybe I talk further with the principal to figure out a plan.\u00a0 I do feel she would support me.\u00a0 As of now, I\u2019m doing nothing, indefinitely\u2026Every day at work, I talk in a relatively high pitch (for me).\u00a0 Then I get in my car and talk to myself or sing in my (newer) lower register.\u00a0 Why don\u2019t I talk that way at work?\u00a0 I can\u2019t really answer that.Not everyone is as supportive or knowledgeable as my friends and community.\u00a0 I went to a meeting recently, and we all went around and introduced ourselves.\u00a0 I included my preferred pronouns in my introduction.\u00a0 The person across from me scoffed.\u00a0 I felt not trans enough.\u00a0 Not trans enough for mainstream society, at this time.I wonder will this change in my lifetime?\u00a0 And if not really, can I at least contribute in some really small ways to small changes around me?\u00a0 Can I at least get everyone in all the bubbles I occupy (this means work and out and about in public) on board?\u00a0 I think that I can, but it\u2019s going to take me a lot longer than I\u2019d like.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
