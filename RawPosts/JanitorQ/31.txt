Oh, hey, dang, I’ve been absent for a while.  I was in the hospital, again because I was manic (the time before that was January, 2015).  This time it was a week:  from May 15th-22nd.  I’m currently out of work until June 19th.  I’m sure once I’m feeling up to it, I’ll be writing a lot in the upcoming weeks.  For now though, I’m thinking I’ll have a handful of short, somewhat abstract updates to this blog.  The first one being:I am a transgender person and I was hospitalized for mania and my blood was tested, and I was administered my testosterone shot, but my T-levels in my bloodstream were not monitored at any point in time during my stay.I feel legitimately angry, like, about as angry as I am capable of getting, about this.  Because I experienced some really really bizarre symptoms while there, that I would chalk up to hormonal issues, but there’s nothing for me to measure that against.I was shouting A LOT.  Like, I am not a shouter.  I was SUPER vocal, the entire time I was there..My menstrual cycle came back in a super condensed, concentrated form, for about 3 days…Digestive issues…Sex drive??  ZeroI called people out in their shit, in real time (generally something might occur to me later, what I should have said)…I was actually able to keep my anxiety in check this time…Smells and tastes were all over the place… Blah!  When will it sink in, that transgender people face different challenges, and these need monitoring too!
