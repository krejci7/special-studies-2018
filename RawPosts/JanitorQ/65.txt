The Honeydrippers were a band from 1981-1985, formed by Led Zeppelin lead singer, Robert Plant.\u00a0 It was kind of a part of that resurgence of 50s style music, in the 80s.\u00a0 Other memebers included Jimmy Paige, Jeff Beck, Paul Shaffer, Brian Setzer, and a bunch of others.\u00a0 They only recorded one EP.This post is part of a series.\u00a0 Here are the previous ones:Summer of t-shirts #4 / Transgender TrailblazersSummer of t-shirts #3 / Back to workSummer of t-shirts #2 / How to fold a shirt1 month after top surgery / Summer of t-shirts #1\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
