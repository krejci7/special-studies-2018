I guess would be the word?\u00a0 I have to say that I\u2019m still alarmed by my new name.\u00a0 It still feels like, \u201cis that me?\u201d\u00a0 I definitely still feel like I have to change it, and if I were to go by a new name, that would be it.\u00a0 There is no better name.\u00a0 But I guess ultimately I feel like, why couldn\u2019t the name I\u2019m used to just have worked out.\u00a0 (I\u2019m super slow to warm up to change \u2013 if it\u2019s not obvious.)\u00a0 This tells me that it\u2019s not quite time to pursue legally changing my name.\u00a0 There will be a time \u2013 it\u2019s just not yet.To conclude, here are some face shots:\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
