I\u2019ll probably go to bed by 2AM.\u00a0 This is what I do, Monday through Friday.\u00a0 It means that I never see my partner during the work week.\u00a0 We have to catch up via telephone, notes, and emails, which is sometimes extremely frustrating.\u00a0 It means that I don\u2019t see much of anyone during the work week.\u00a0 Like, some friends are going out to dinner for someone\u2019s birthday?\u00a0 Sorry, can\u2019t make it.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to the movies?\u00a0 Sounds like fun.\u00a0 I stopped being jealous over the stuff I was missing out on a long time ago.\u00a0 Better to just accept it.\u00a0 And, on special occasions, I can always just call in sick or work a half day or something.I\u2019ve found that there is often a natural camaraderie amongst people who work strange hours.\u00a0 For example, I\u2019ll sometimes go to the grocery store, still in uniform, around midnight, and the cashier always wants to tell me what time she gets off work.\u00a0 And if I haven\u2019t been in a while, she\u2019ll ask, \u201cWhere you been?\u201d\u00a0 Maybe the summer has passed by (I work like normal people during the summer), so I\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, I was on a different trick.\u201d\u00a0 And she\u2019ll say, \u201cThat\u2019s always the reason!\u00a0 Whenever I haven\u2019t seen someone in a while, it\u2019s because their trick changed.\u201dSo, essentially, shift work disorder is a medical condition that can be diagnosed and treated by a doctor.\u00a0 (Phew!)\u00a0 It occurs when your job calls you to duty and you end up fighting against your natural circadian rhythms.\u00a0 It\u2019ll cause insomnia when you\u2019re trying to sleep, and ES (excessive sleepiness \u2013 so relieved that there\u2019s a medically coded shortened version for this term!) while you need to work.\u00a0 Shift work disorder was invented in 2011 to help people figure out why they feel tired.Whoa.\u00a0 Ok, lemme try to go back to the point where I do think this is all positive if it helps people improve their lives.\u00a0 I just worry people will see an ad on TV, or their physician will bring it up with them first, and they\u2019ll just mindlessly pile on more pills to the over-medicated masses.Like I mentioned, I don\u2019t work overnights, so my experience is not nearly as extreme as many people\u2019s.\u00a0 But I do want to point out that I feel like my work / sleep schedule has actually created MORE room for circadian rhythms to do their thing, according to the seasons.\u00a0 It seems only natural that people would feel the need to sleep more during the winter months, if they could.\u00a0 But I\u2019d imagine most people\u2019s schedules don\u2019t allow for extra sleep.\u00a0 They have to get up with their alarm and get to work.\u00a0 Me?\u00a0 I can sleep as much as I want, apparently.\u00a0 I don\u2019t generally have much going on in the mornings or early afternoons before work, so, often I\u2019d let myself sleep 9-10 hours a night when it really seemed like I naturally tended toward this, roughly November-February.\u00a0 (A luxury, I know.)\u00a0 I was actually starting to feel concerned about all the oversleeping (I was wasting so much time!), but it abruptly righted itself; in February, I could no longer sleep in.\u00a0 As if, my body knew that spring was on the way and I better start getting ready!Brand new diagnoses coming soon:\u2013 sitting-on-the-couch disorder \u2013 texting-while-driving disorder \u2013 junk-food-for-lunch disorder \u2013 gender identity disorder Oh, wait\u2026\u00a0\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
