First post:\u00a0 low-dose testosterone for the rest of my lifeAt the time, I thought about testosterone and it\u2019s effects all the time.\u00a0 I was hyper-aware of any physical changes (mostly not wanting anything to change) and also my internal states.\u00a0 It\u2019s impossible to inhabit that way of being, long-term, of course, and other life events happened, causing roller-coaster-like mental states.\u00a0 And I started to wonder what testosterone was doing for me anymore.I had been treating testosterone like a psychotropic drug, in my mind.\u00a0 And, in a way, it kind of is (a naturally occurring one).\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t on any medications, and I kind of saw it as the solution to my mental health issues.\u00a0 Until it wasn\u2019t.\u00a0 (But it did feel like it was for quite a while.)When I did go back on medications (a little over a year ago), the purpose of taking testosterone started to feel like it was getting diluted.\u00a0 And the reason to stay on it became, \u201cI need to keep as much as I can the same, right now, so that I can stabilize\u201d rather than, \u201cTestosterone is stabilizing me.\u201dRight around the end of December, I finally switched to a medication that seemed to be working (maybe for the first time ever, for me).\u00a0 And right around that same time, I decided to stop taking testosterone.\u00a0 Was the timing coincidental?\u00a0 No.\u00a0 It felt like I found a substitute, actually.\u00a0 And I\u2019m still feeling really really good.I\u2019m still undecided about how much more masculine I would like to look and sound, and if I would want to use testosterone to get me there.\u00a0 It\u2019d be awesome if I could pick and choose\u2026 (probably most trans-people wish this).\u00a0 I would pick a moderately lower voice, a little more muscle mass, and a higher sex-drive.\u00a0 I would toss the facial hair and balding, the acne, the feeling too hot, and the other body hair.This will probably be my last update in this series \u201c___ years on testosterone without noticeable masculinizing changes,\u201d since I\u2019m not currently on testosterone.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t make sense!\u00a0 Most definitely I\u2019ll start it right back up if I decide to go back on.\u00a0 And I imagine, where I am right now, that my reasons will be different.\u00a0 Less of, \u201cwhat would testosterone feel like?,\u201d and more of \u201chow much do I want my body to change?\u201dFrom my experience, I kind of feel like, if you\u2019re on the fence about hormones, and you\u2019re not sure about how you feel, gender-wise, it\u2019s worth a try (if you can get access).\u00a0 It might take you to a new place on your journey.\u00a0 It might jump-start something inside you.\u00a0 It did for me.\u00a0 Or, on the other hand, it could help you rule something out.\u00a0 I know someone who was unsure about starting estrogen, but they kept obsessing over it.\u00a0 Once they went through the steps, and had the estrogen on hand, they suddenly strongly felt they did not want to continue to pursue that path (after taking only one day\u2019s worth of the hormone.)\u00a0 So, either way, you may learn something about yourself\u2026Here are some past posts in this series, for reference: Five months on T One year on T Two years on T Two point seven-five years on T (Two weeks off)\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
