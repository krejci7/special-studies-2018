it\u2019s just a motivating factor, something that pushes me to try to capture it as best as I can.I just did a cursory search, and a couple of books that stand out as worth checking out are: Stress Fracture: A Memoir of Psychosis and Brain on Fire: My Month of MadnessHere are the other posts I have made, yearly:Continuing to work through a specific trauma \u2013 Four years ago, I wrote about\u00a0how I finally gained access\u00a0to the\u00a0medical records from my hospital stay, and how I started to process things differently with the help of my therapist.That specific trauma is still there \u2013 Three\u00a0years ago, I wrote about finally bringing that record into therapy and how it felt to have her go through it.\u00a0 I was starting to realize that maybe I didn\u2019t need to pick it all apart; maybe my perspective was shifting naturally, over time.That specific trauma is no longer a big deal \u2013 Two years ago,\u00a0I wrote about how much time has changed things, and it no longer felt like a big deal. \u00a0The fact that I had been hospitalized again, that year, surprisingly\u00a0helped me find ways to heal, rather than adding more baggage onto the feeling of it.Anniversaries, traumas, deaths, and name change \u2013 Then last year, I wrote about how other things were going on, and I really didn\u2019t have the space or time to reflect.\u00a0 Which was perfectly fine.\u00a0 Between the election results, working on getting my name legally changed, and other emotional markers, it just didn\u2019t come up.This year, I am thinking about it, but it is more in terms of \u201cone of the times I was hospitalized,\u201d rather than, \u201ca traumatic event \u2013 the worst thing that ever happened to me,\u201d etc.\u00a0I\u2019ve been thinking of all the little occurrences that go into the bigger story.\u00a0 Like, for example, in that state, my mind was so malleable and adaptable that it seemed like, theoretically, anything could be true and just as easily, not true all at once.\u00a0 Which is one of the reasons I avoided watching any TV.\u00a0 (There were two TVs on the unit \u2013 one played music and had legalese constantly scrolling, in both Spanish and English \u2013 like a \u201cknow your rights\u201d kind of thing.\u00a0 The other TV had a remote and listing of channels, and we could watch whatever we wanted, 24/7.)\u00a0 At one point I did sit down, and there was a documentary on about pineapples.\u00a0 (Er, rather I\u2019m sure the documentary was on something more broad, but I saw the pineapple part.\u00a0 I started yelling about the unlikelihood about these pineapples growing.\u00a0 Don\u2019t pineapples grow on trees like sensible fruits?\u00a0 What were these miniature pineapples growing up from fronds in the dirt?!\u00a0 A patient who knew-all immediately matched the intensity I was spewing, and argued for the realness of these pineapples.A few months later, my spouse\u2019s aunt was visiting from Hawaii, and sure enough, she grows pineapples on her property and sure enough, she had pics to prove it.\u00a0 I can now accept it fully.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "janitorqueer"}
