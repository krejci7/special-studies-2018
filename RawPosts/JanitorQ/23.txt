Today, a mere 5 days later?!!! \u00a0It\u2019s at $35,126 \u2013 more than double of that goal!!!That means, I\u2019m assuming, that the artists are going to get paid even more $$. \u00a0They were going to be getting paid $25 per page \u2013 I wonder if that\u2019ll get raised to $50 / page. \u00a0Hopefully!I pre-ordered my copy and cannot wait to get to read it in its entirety!In the meantime, I asked one of the authors, whom I met online through a Facebook group, how they got started / how they found out about contributing.Me: How did you get into graphic arts? Do you have formal training or are you mostly self-taught?Kyri:I have been drawing since I was old enough to have motor control to move a crayon around, and telling stories for almost as long as that. My early focus was on animals, but I branched out to people, stories, and comics in late elementary school when I discovered manga. That\u2019s held on for the long haul. I went to a liberal arts school instead of a traditional art school, which turned out better for comics anyway because I could minor in creative writing. I focused mostly on printmaking in college, which translates really well to comics \u2013 a lot of thinking in sharp black and whites and the graphic quality of lines, and how a reproduced image reaches large audiences.Me: \u00a0How did you first hear about this project?Kyri: I\u2019m part of a comic creator\u2019s group in Boston, the Boston Comics Roundtable, and someone there signal boosted the open call for submissions \u2013 I can\u2019t for the life of me remember who. I almost didn\u2019t send in a submission packet, and actually ended up submitting something a week late, because I was a little intimidated by the people in charge and the people who were already part of the project. I\u2019m so glad I pushed past my fears, though, and I\u2019m really excited to be published alongside all these fantastic trans artistsMe:How did you narrow down the story that you wanted to tell? Is it your \u201cquintessential\u201d coming-out story, of sorts, or something more tangential?Kyri:I knew when I first saw the open call and the concept for the anthology that I wanted to do something about my bodily experience with both gender dysphoria and chronic illness. I have fibromyalgia and hypermobile joints, and it really affects how I\u2019m able to present on any given day. Binding can really hurt my ribcage if I\u2019m not careful, and sometimes the compression just ends up hurting my muscles because of the constant contact, even if I\u2019m binding correctly. Being chronically ill also means I\u2019m not as fit as I once was, and the extra weight means I get misgendered constantly, even when I am attempting to present androgynous/masculine. I think that most people tend to think of the thin attractive model of androgyny when they think of what it means to be agender or demigender, and there\u2019s just not enough discussion around diversity of trans bodies outside of our community. There\u2019s also this pervasive and weird idea that you can only be \u201cone thing\u201d so convincing people I\u2019m both trans AND have an invisible disability is an ordeal sometimes. I wanted to do something to touch on all of that, and ended up with an autobio comic in which my body is compared to a house.Kyri Lorenz: \u00a0Hailing from the mountains of Northern Colorado, Kyri Lorenz is an agender jack-of-all-trades creator with a long history of meddling with concepts of nature and identity. If it involves creation and inspiration, Kyri is there, getting their mitts all over it and learning how best to make it serve their whims. Most of the time, this is easy and the technique or medium is more than happy to comply. Sometimes, it takes a little more finagling, but there\u2019s always something to show for it at the end.They got their BA in Visual Arts from Hollins University in Roanoke, VA, and are currently living and working in Cambridge, MA.
