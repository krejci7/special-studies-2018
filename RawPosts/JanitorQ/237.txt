It was awesome!\u00a0 Like, I would think about and look forward to getting to eat.\u00a0 I would prefer certain things over other things, by a lot.\u00a0 That quickly dwindled back to my normal feelings and attitudes about food, which are not very exciting.\u00a0 Not at all.\u00a0 Sometimes eating is a real chore, in fact.\u00a0 The one thing that feels different now is that if I skip eating at a time I usually eat at, I will feel more motivated to catch up.\u00a0 In that way, I will feel hungrier if I don\u2019t eat.\u00a0 That wasn\u2019t really true before.\u00a0 Also, I\u2019ve gained 5 or 6 pounds, which manifests in the one externally noticeable physical change going on \u2013 muscle growth, mainly in my arms, shoulders, pecs, and abs.\u00a0 Really psyched about this.\u00a0 Can\u2019t go wrong with more muscles!Warm and Fuzzy:\u00a0 I just feel cuddly and cozy.\u00a0 I feel connected to my body in a way I never have before.\u00a0 It\u2019s really hard to describe, but I\u2019m sure people can relate.\u00a0 Like, my clothes feel soft on my skin.\u00a0 Like, I\u2019m walking on pillows and clouds, yet paradoxically, I feel totally grounded.\u00a0 Like, I had no idea how jagged and disconnected I was before; I had nothing to compare it to.\u00a0 These sensations have been dwindling over time \u2013 I think I\u2019ve been getting used to them.\u00a0 Like the clouds are not quite as soft and pillowy as they were at first.Sex Drive:\u00a0 Having a sex drive I can relate to is awesome.\u00a0 Being able to have sexual thoughts and have that be connected to a body sensation.\u00a0 My body responding to sexual stimuli.\u00a0 Having totally different sensations everywhere on my body than I used to, in a good way.\u00a0 Clitoral growth, which means actually being able to feel and experience erectile tissue sensations.\u00a0 Previously, junk was so small and sensitive in a bad way, it wasn\u2019t all that fun.Anxiety:\u00a0 The biggest, most drastic change, is anxiety:\u00a0 totally gone!\u00a0 Like general anxiety just disappeared into thin air.\u00a0 I still totally over-think things and mentally worry way too much, but the fact that those thoughts aren\u2019t connected to physical anxiety responses is a huge relief.\u00a0 I was exerting so much energy on things that don\u2019t matter!\u00a0 I was feeling so drained and limited by these feelings that I couldn\u2019t get away from before!\u00a0 It\u2019s a lot of work avoiding things that might trigger unpleasant internal responses; now I don\u2019t do that nearly so much!\u00a0 It is totally a brain chemistry shift \u2013 I don\u2019t know how or why, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m worrying about haha.\u00a0 Also, emotionality overall hasn\u2019t changed much.\u00a0 I still have been experiencing the same range and types of emotions, which I\u2019m happy for.\u00a0 If anything, there might be a slight capacity to acknowledge anger and frustration now, which seems positive.\u00a0 I\u2019ll have to see how that plays into my life.I\u2019ve been on Androgel, 1%, 1 pump (1.25g) per day.\u00a0 I started with 1.62% for about 2 months, but I started to see some changes that freaked me out (voice dropping and body hair growth), so I asked to switch to 1%.\u00a0 Which I did for 2 months (voice went back to where it was, body hair growth stopped).\u00a0 Then recently I started alternating between the two every other day.\u00a0 Which has been working out so far, and I like.\u00a0 I just hope I can continue to alternate my prescriptions.\u00a0 I might be questioned on that\u2026I have had some other slight physical changes that seem common:\u00a0 I feel warmer, body temperature-wise.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had some pimples pop up, particularly in places I wouldn\u2019t normally get pimples \u2013 thighs, butt, armpit(?)\u00a0 I\u2019ve been slightly sweatier (my partner would say significantly sweatier, haha).I want to be able to use testosterone for the rest of my life, but to not change much, physically speaking, over time, if possible.\u00a0 So far, it does seem possible.\u00a0 The internal shifts are too good, I couldn\u2019t have even imagined, or dreamed them up, in advance.\u00a0 I\u2019m still just hanging out, revelling in it all.\u00a0 One of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 24 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
