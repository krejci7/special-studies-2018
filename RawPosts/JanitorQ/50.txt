\u00a0So cool! \u00a0(Well, ok, except for family members, which is different).Last Monday, I finally went downtown to get the process rolling on getting it legally changed. \u00a0I think the hold-up was: \u00a0I wasn\u2019t ready to come out at work, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to change my last name, too, while I was at it.I\u2019m now feeling good about coming out at work within the near future. \u00a0Also, I decided to change my first, middle, and last name. \u00a0That\u2019s going to take some getting used to, since I haven\u2019t changed that anywhere yet, even socially. \u00a0Guess I gotta come up with a new signature too.The process was not too bad: \u00a0I printed some documents out from an online site, and fortunately my spouse\u2019s dad is a notary, so we were able to go over to her parents\u2019 house to get that all in order and signed, the day before. \u00a0I had Monday off work, and it turned out to be a gorgeous day, so I decided to bike. \u00a0(So glad I did because I ended up having to go back and forth, and to a few places. \u00a0Parking is tough downtown, and I was able to zip around and lock up at VIP spots anywhere I was going, haha \u2013 VIP spots meaning street signs and trees.)I first went to the information desk at the County Clerks\u2019 office. \u00a0The lady was brusque, giving me 2 other documents that had to be filled out, asking me if I had my index #, and telling me I needed 3 copies of all these papers. \u00a0Luckily, my spouse\u2019s dad, who works downtown, had told me I could contact him if I needed anything else. \u00a0I called him, biked over the few blocks to his office \u2013 it was cool to see where he works! \u2013 and he helped me fill out the rest, plus he made copies of everything and paper-clipped everything neatly and efficiently, with clips on both the top and the sides!) \u00a0I thanked him and rode back and got in line, where I stood for probably a half hour. \u00a0When it was my turn though, I got through quickly. \u00a0I paid the $210 fee, got my index number, and got a receipt.They told me I then had to go to the Hall of Justice, to the Judicial Clerk\u2019s office. \u00a0This involved more bike riding, plus a walk through a metal detector and asking around in order to find the right room. \u00a0Things went smoothly there too, although I noticed that on the receipt I got from the County Clerk\u2019s office, they spelled \u201cKameron,\u201d \u201cKamerson.\u201d \u00a0Aarrgh! \u00a0I asked if this was going to be a problem, and I was assured that it was fine \u2013 the judge wasn\u2019t going to be looking at that at all.I then biked to a coffee shop and worked on some writing for the rest of the afternoon. \u00a0About to head home, I ran into a friend, and we chatted for a while. \u00a0Then a stranger approached us with a digital recorder, and he asked if he could ask us a question for a radio show. \u00a0I said, \u201cprobably!\u201d \u00a0So he launched into, \u201cOK, so the Cubs won the world series, and that hasn\u2019t happened in 108 years. \u00a0And then Trump was actually elected president. \u00a0So, with all this going on, what\u2019s next?\u201d \u00a0I said, \u201cFlying lizards,\u201d just because it was the first thing that popped into my head, but if I had thought for even just a second, in retrospect, I would have said, \u201cSUPERMOON!\u201d because I\u2019d heard that on that day, (November 14th), it was the biggest it\u2019s been in 69 years, and it\u2019s not going to be that big again for another 34!Oh well. \u00a0Next time I\u2019ll make more sense.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
