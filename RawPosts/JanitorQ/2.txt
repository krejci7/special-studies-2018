First, call out to see if anyone is in there.\u00a0 If they are, wait. 2. Next, take a sign that is now velcro-ed to the back of all bathroom doors, and velcro-adhere it to the front.\u00a0 This sign reads, \u201cDo Not Enter.\u00a0 Cleaning in Progress.\u201d 3. Close the door, and then do whatever you\u2019re doing, whether it\u2019s just loading more paper towels or full-on cleaning the bathroom.Before this, we only had to be conscious if we were in bathrooms that were opposite to the ones of our gender/sex.When I came out to the principal and assistant principal, one of the first and only questions they asked was about bathrooms.\u00a0 Which bathrooms did I plan on using?\u00a0 If she (the principal) could make a suggestion, it would be best if I only used the gender neutral bathrooms.\u00a0 I was polite in response, even though I had not thought this through, and at the time, I used both the women\u2019s bathrooms and the gender neutral bathrooms.\u00a0 All I said was, \u201cA lot of people are worried about bathrooms when it comes to trans-people.\u201dAs it is, a year later, I really only do use the gender-neutral bathrooms because different people within the school have different perceptions about where I\u2019m at, and I want to protect myself and also foster the idea that I am neither male nor female.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t plan on this.\u00a0 I thought I\u2019d be continuing to use both women\u2019s and gender-neutral ones.\u00a0 But I\u2019m not.I clean one set of bathrooms in the \u201ccentrum,\u201d an open plan area where the first graders are taught \u2013 there are 3 regular classrooms, 2 resource classrooms, a big open area, and two bathrooms.\u00a0 These bathrooms don\u2019t have doors on them, and also therefore, there are no, \u201cDo Not Enter, Cleaning in Progress\u201d signs accompanying them.\u00a0 Since I do get a head start while the first graders are getting ready to go home, I always\u00a0yell, \u201cAnyone in here?\u201d even before just dumping the trash / cleaning the sinks.\u00a0 (Due to placement, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d encounter someone using the restroom from the sink area.)A few days ago, I was doing my routine and called out like always.\u00a0 No one answered.\u00a0 I was putting in a new roll of paper towel.\u00a0 Then I heard a toilet flush.\u00a0 Also a bunch of kids were to the immediate right of this bathroom, putting on their winter coats and boots.\u00a0 I finished loading the paper towel, deciding that it would have been a bigger deal if I had just left it half loaded in my paranoia to escape the bathroom.\u00a0 The girl washed her hands and then I ripped off a piece for her to dry her hands.Kids who were right there had a very lively conversation! \u201cThere are no boys allowed in the girl\u2019s room.\u201d \u201cAnd also no girls allowed in the boy\u2019s room.\u201d \u201cBut why is he in there in the bathroom then?\u201d \u201cHe has to be in there because that\u2019s his job.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s putting more paper towels in there.\u201d \u201cBut still are you sure he can be in there?\u201dI just cleared out without further fanfare, but I felt kinda flustered.\u00a0 Personally, I still feel like I half belong in the girl\u2019s / women\u2019s bathrooms.\u00a0 Indeed, those are the ones I use the vast majority of the time when I am out in public.I was intrigued that these first graders gathered that I was male.\u00a0 I honestly have no clue whether kids at the school I work at think I\u2019m male or female.\u00a0 Whenever I\u2019m asked (this happens so rarely), I do make a point to say, \u201cI\u2019m neither.\u00a0 I\u2019m a little bit of both.\u201d\u00a0 But short of that, I don\u2019t have a clue what conclusions they come to!One other thing that is tangentially related, I feel, because it concerns personal space:\u00a0 Since I\u2019ve come out, had top surgery, and been on testosterone for long enough that my physique and how I carry myself has changed, I get touched a lot more at work.\u00a0 Some teachers pat or gently tap my shoulders and back.\u00a0 A few days ago, I was thrown way off when a kid patted my midsection for no apparent reason!\u00a0 It\u2019s definitely different, and I don\u2019t respond likewise with anyone, but I gotta say that I do think it\u2019s a positive change \u2013 I think people can tell that I am more comfortable in my skin, and some of them act accordingly.I\u2019ll take it!If you\u2019d like to see what I originally wrote about this topic, back in January of 2014, here it is: Bathroom anxieties:\u00a0 a genderqueer janitor\u2019s perspective I decided to write a Part 2 because this one felt outdated.\u00a0 And I still haven\u2019t covered everything, not by a lot shot!\u00a0 (probably part 3 will appear in the future\u2026)\u00a0", "feedtitle": "janitorqueer"}
