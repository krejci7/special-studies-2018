Bathroom anxieties:\u00a0 a genderqueer janitor\u2019s perspective \u2013 I also wrote this early on, and I think that if I were to write it over again, there would be lots of edits.\u00a0 But I\u2019m leaving it as is, for now.\u00a0 It\u2019s a document of a time, I guess. One year on testosterone without physical changes \u2013 This got a lot of traffic because it got a boost from Micah.\u00a0 I asked him if he\u2019d share it on his social media outlets.\u00a0 Thanks, Micah! A story about what it feels like to be bigender \u2013 I\u2019m also really glad this gets a lot of traffic because I worked pretty hard on it, and I think it\u2019s really illuminating and informative.\u00a0 I don\u2019t identify as bigender, but a lot of people are curious about what it means to be bigender.Two posts that I\u2019m considering deleting, because they pop up in people\u2019s searches too much and are probably off-topic: Ruling with elf wisdom \u2013 People want to know what it means to \u201crule with elf wisdom,\u201d and this post isn\u2019t going to tell them anything about that.\u00a0 It\u2019s actually about a name I was considering going by, which means \u201cruling with elf wisdom.\u201d\u00a0 But then I nixed that name.\u00a0 So it\u2019s not even relevant any longer\u2026 Office work and trans-YA fiction \u2013 People search for \u201coffice work\u201d pretty frequently, but I\u2019m not sure why!\u00a0 And this is barely about that \u2013 it\u2019s about how I volunteered in the office at my local gay alliance for a while, but it\u2019s more about some YA books I was reading while sitting there, bored, in the office.Other than that, most of my search results have seemed relevant, which is good!\u00a0 A lot of questions about taking testosterone while on other psychotropic drugs, about being trans and using the bathroom, about different terms under the \u201cgenderqueer\u201d umbrella\u2026\u00a0 It seems that just as many searches are about janitors as they are about being trans.\u00a0 I guess I feel kind of weird about that because even though being a janitor is a big part of my identity and a\u00a0 semi-big part of this blog, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m representational of janitors in general, for when people are searching for info about janitors\u2026\u00a0 Oh well.Here are some of the more bizarre search terms that have led people to my blog: \u201ccommercial work schedule disorder\u201d \u2013 I once wrote about shift-work disorder, so that\u2019s probably where they landed. \u201cliterotica drag king\u201d \u2013 I like that word!\u00a0 I\u2019m going to start using it! \u201cMTF tree house transgender\u201d \u2013 Once my spouse and I stayed in a tree house while on vacation.\u00a0 And I mentioned that.\u00a0 Haha. \u201cimages of scrap books to be made for bf\u201d \u2013\u00a0 Not sure.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never mentioned a scrap book or a boyfriend. \u201care janitors off on snow days at school\u201d \u2013\u00a0 YES THEY ARE!\u00a0 PAID DAY OFF! \u201cwhy would another male janitor pee all over your bathroom\u201d \u2013 Damn, I do not know dude. \u201cqueer mullet\u201d \u2013 I am queer and I do have a mullet.\u00a0 More information about this can be found here:\u00a0 Queer/Trans- visiblity:\u00a0 (flannel + mullet).For the future, I would like to continue to take academic papers and studies, and distill them into something that is relate-able.\u00a0 That\u2019s probably my favorite thing to work on.\u00a0 If anyone knows of any, let me know!\u00a0 I\u2019ll continue to document my life too, of course.Stay tuned\u2026\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
