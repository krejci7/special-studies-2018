all customer-serviceness left his voice.\u00a0 I paused for a good long while.\u00a0 Repeated the question back to him.\u00a0 Said, \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 Said, \u201cI\u2019m not legally male; if there is any other criteria under which someone could be male, I\u2019m interested in that.\u201d\u00a0 But his helpfulness was long gone.\u00a0 I felt mildly humiliated; he just kept grinding it in that he could do nothing further for me.My jaded brain (during a conversation with my partner\u2019s jaded brain, haha) decided that men are rewarded for using Androgel because the company is trying to promote a specific type of patient for their product.\u00a0 Rugged, middle-aged, robust and vigorous.\u00a0 Masculine.\u00a0 Diagnosed with low testosterone, just needing a boost.\u00a0 Just take a look at the pics of men on their website: Androgel websiteI am nothing like the men on the website.\u00a0 However, I am just as worthy of being eligible for a discount program!\u00a0 I would call it \u201cThe Re-imagination Program.\u201d\u00a0 Testosterone has certainly aided me in re-imagining who I am and what I can do / who I can become.I told the pharmacist I wasn\u2019t eligible.\u00a0 He acted surprised, but my jaded brain decided he already knew.\u00a0 The next day, I called my doctor\u2019s office; asked for the prescription to be written the way it had previously been written.\u00a0 Got a call back that it was all set; ready for pick-up.\u00a0 Picked up the prescription, went back to the pharmacy, got my 3 month supply for $50.\u00a0 Anticipating more hassles in the future\u2026\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 16 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
