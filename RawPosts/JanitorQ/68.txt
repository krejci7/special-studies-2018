It\u2019s possible for transgender athletes to compete without making public announcements of transition. Knowing he had the option to privately navigate sports as a man, it took Mosier years to decide to come out publicly as a trans gender athlete. But he did so to set precedence. \u2018It\u2019s like running the four-minute mile,\u2019 he explains. \u2018First people say it can\u2019t be done. Then someone does it. Then it\u2019s done again and again, faster and faster \u2013 just because the impossible was possible.'\u201dHe adds,\u201cJust because the rules allow it doesn\u2019t mean that everyone is ready to accept it.\u00a0 Public opinion is the challenging piece.\u201dHaving Nike on board, with this groundbreaking commercial, will certainly help!\u00a0 Although Nike (like any large corporation), is an evil behemoth, I am so psyched about the fact that they made this commercial.\u00a0 Good one.\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
