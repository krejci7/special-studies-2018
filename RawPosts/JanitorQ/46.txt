(been doing them through Skype) have been with a physician\u2019s assistant. \u00a0The only other time to see her will be at the 1 year-follow-up.I was not completely satisfied with the results (although these pics don\u2019t look too bad). \u00a0The left side is larger than the right, and the nipples are uneven, a little sunken in, and (at 6 months) purplish in color. \u00a0It\u2019s tough to see from the pics, but I believe some muscle tissue was taken out on the right side, and there\u2019s a dent to the right of the nipple. \u00a0Sensation is touchy, but slowly improving. \u00a0I recently realized that my rib cage is not symmetrical, so that may have impacted my results.I plan on seeking a nipple revision, at the least, in the future. \u00a0Since I would have to pay more for this, from Dr. Rumer, I will be looking at options elsewhere as well.At the time of surgery, I was not on T. \u00a0I\u2019d been on a super-low dose prior, for 2.5 years, but I do not think that impacted my musculature.More information can be found at: \u00a0https://janitorqueer.com/category/top-surgery/\u00a0\u201dHere are past updates about top surgery, documenting as I go: 4.5 months after top surgery: \u00a04.5 months is an odd point \u2013 but it seems worthwhile to write now, mostly because within the last couple of weeks, sensation has been returning at a faster rate. and I want to make note of that. \u2026 3 months after top surgery: \u00a0I did not expect to feel much different other than a cerebral satisfaction regarding being able to wear anything from now on. \u00a0But it\u2019s more of a gut- level confidence. \u2026 1 month after top surgery: \u00a0I can live with that for now, but I doubt things are going to change enough for it to actually look good.\u00a0 I\u2019m not happy with the results. \u2026 2 weeks after top surgery: \u00a0Right now, there is not enough symmetry, in multiple regards. \u2026 6 days after top surgery: \u00a0Everything went smoothly, except for the fact that the surgeon was about to do the wrong procedure. \u2026\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
