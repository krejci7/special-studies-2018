\u00a0Plus, the dynamic with both of them was so much better. \u00a0A lot of times, they are\u00a0like foils to each other. \u00a0I said the stuff (the name, the pronouns, the \u201cneither male nor female,\u201d) the principal brought up bathrooms (which I have mixed feelings about), the assistant principal brought the energy and excitement, but also brought up how he was not going to be able to remember, and that\u2019s not anything about me. \u00a0I said yeah yeah I know it\u2019ll be an adjustment period. \u00a0(In my head, I\u2019m thinking, how long is this adjustment period, exactly???)Friday (tomorrow) \u2013 I have about 5 other people I\u2019d like to tell in person, if I get the chance. \u00a0If not, no big deal. \u00a0Everyone\u2019s gonna be focused on Xmas parties and getting ready for domestic family things and cookies and blah blah blah. \u00a0We\u2019ll see. \u00a0The best part is there\u2019s really no more pressure!And so, that\u2019s it! \u00a0Now I just wait for things to happen around me. \u00a0Next week, during Xmas Recess, the only people who will be at the school will be me, my two co-workers, my supervisor, and maybe the principal and assistant principal. \u00a0So, that\u2019s a whole week for the people who say my name the most, to practice. \u00a0I have a feeling my co-worker / ally will step up and lead it, followed by me correcting everyone every single time.Then teachers and kids come back. \u00a0And teachers will have a heads up from the principal one way or another, and then I just start correcting, correcting, correcting. \u00a0For how long? \u00a0Not sure.(I gotta say, I definitely feel good and accomplished, but I don\u2019t feel that \u201cwheeeeeeeee\u201d feeling that often comes with big comings-out. \u00a0I\u2019m attributing that to my medication, for better and worse. \u00a0It makes so many things so much easier, but those roller coaster feelings \u2013 yeah, I miss the good ones\u2026)\u00a0", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
