I would recommend this book to any activist, but especially to white, middle-class activists in the \u201cLGBT movement.\u201d \u00a0The pieces in this anthology encourage us to get away from the white, middle-class idea of \u201csafety.\u201d \u00a0Strong sentences for hate crimes don\u2019t make us safer. \u00a0Nor do most of the priorities of LGBT rights organizations. \u00a0It is only from a privileged position that we can even believe that there might be a safe, mainstream, assimilated place to work and live. Conservatives and moderates in the movement, and outside of it, want you to feel safe. \u00a0It\u2019s another story of us versus them: it helps those who are disgusted by trans people of color, by poor queer youth, by public queer sexualities, to tug the most powerful and heavily funded segments of the LGBT population away into a zone of \u201csafety\u201d and assimilation. \u00a0Of course, many queer and trans people don\u2019t have that luxury, and it\u2019s foolish to think that any of us really do. \u00a0Queer and trans people in prison, juveniles in the child \u201cwelfare\u201d system, immigrants, sex workers, the homeless, and other marginalized groups are often victims of a cruel and unusual system that targets minorities and encourages oppression.  The words \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d bring me to the second reason why this review is so timely. \u00a0Today, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a district court in finding that a law denying trans prisoners hormone treatment or sex reassignment surgery constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution. \u00a0This is an exciting victory, but it\u2019s also not enough. Cruel and unusual punishment goes beyond the specific case of denying medical treatment to prisoners with \u201csevere\u201d cases of Gender Identity Disorder (a term that, thankfully, is up for a change in the DSM-V). \u00a0The way the entire medical, legal, and government establishments medicalize, criminalize, and problematize queer and trans bodies is cruel and unusual. \u00a0This case is an important step as evidenced by the horrific stories in Captive Genders about trans people being denied hormones, surgery, and even HIV/AIDS treatment, but the opinion still problematizes trans bodies. \u00a0The medical model says that to qualify for surgery, one must demonstrate gender in a certain way. \u00a0There is little room for creativity or subjective experience. \u00a0A trans body under this model is something to feel pity over, the familiar narrative of being \u201ctrapped.\u201d Examples of problematizing queer and trans bodies abound in the anthology. \u00a0In family law, Wesley Ware describes how the child\u2019s \u201cbest interest\u201d turns into protection from gender variance and children in the system are subjected to \u201csexual-identity confusion counseling,\u201d where queerness is seen as a \u201csymptom\u201d and queer and trans identities are \u201cpathologized.\u201d \u00a0This is particularly true for queer and trans youth of color, who were, in Audre Lorde\u2019s words, \u201cnever meant to survive.\u201d \u00a0In prison, Michelle C. Potts describes the use of blood as an excuse to segregate HIV-positive prisoners, with measures as extreme as not allowing openly gay prisoners (regardless of health status) to serve food. \u00a0Lori A. Saffin describes these insidious sorts of homophobia and transphobia as a form of spirit murder, which I found particularly apt. One of my law school professors, Adrien Wing, taught the concept of spirit murder as a slow build-up of collective psychological and emotional pain over time. \u00a0Spirit murder and spirit injury \u00a0come up in the context of violence in or towards a community\u2013for example, the overall effect of rape on black women. \u00a0They are so destructive because they prey not only on an individual but on an identity and even an entire culture. \u00a0An individual doesn\u2019t have to experience direct harm to be a victim of spirit murder. \u00a0The collective harm of many, many physical assaults or assaults on identity instead contribute to the slow murder of a community\u2019s collective soul. \u00a0This concept is easy to apply to queer and trans people, as over time many of us come to accept state harm and the idea that our bodies and identities are criminal, sick, or simply wrong. This problematizing of queer and trans bodies is severe and all-encompassing. \u00a0Furthermore, the mainstream LGBT movement contributes to this problem by failing to recognize the structural nature of homophobic/transphobic oppression. \u00a0We need to ground queer activism in the experience of those most marginalized, as Jennifer Worley describes in the example of the Vanguard in 1970s San Francisco. \u00a0When we look at queer/trans issues as a class problem, we see how those at the bottom of the ladder are ignored, erased, or attacked while higher-up (mostly) gays and lesbians who assimilate are accepted in the mainstream culture. \u00a0Erica R. Meiners uses James Baldwin\u2019s wording to describe this assimilation at the expense of others as \u201cthe price of the ticket.\u201d \u00a0Those who want the benefits of mainstream culture have to accept its priorities, and often don\u2019t notice the harms going on within the broader queer/trans community. \u201cOver the years,\u201d Yasmin Nair explains, \u201cespecially beginning in the mid-1990s, the \u2018gay rights movement\u2019 has become a perfect replica of the neoliberal state.\u201d \u00a0This trend is easy to see, as mainstream media images focus on how gays and lesbians are \u201cjust like you,\u201d and those who don\u2019t look \u201cjust like\u201d those in charge are demonized\u2013people of color, \u201cpromiscuous\u201d bisexuals, gender-deviant trans and genderqueer people, immigrants, indigenous queers, people with disabilities, child-free and polyamorous individuals, etc. \u00a0Rather than focusing on how the prison-industrial complex harms pretty much everyone, it\u2019s easy for some to imagine the PIC as doing its job of keeping the \u201cundesirable\u201d elements out and protecting, rather than attacking, queer communities. The good news is that there are some solutions. \u00a0Captive Genders argues for abolition through a number of pieces, some authored by those who have been in prison themselves. \u00a0Other strategies include pen-pal programs to offer support to queer and trans prisoners and coalition-building with anti-racism and general anti-prison groups. \u00a0Reading about the way Canadian queers in the 1980s appropriated sexual spaces like the bathhouse to create a social space or a queer home, I began to think about how we might offer support through online forums. \u00a0We can also change the conversation through our blogging, writing, and community activism. \u00a0When we talk about \u201cqueer issues,\u201d we can include prison abolition, racial justice, and other issues that have not typically been considered queer. \u00a0A personal, collective response seems to be the most apt way to address such an individualist, capitalist, impersonal problem.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 3 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
