A couple of months ago, in a dialogue with my friend Kyla on Girl w/ Pen around the classification of gender identity disorder, I mentioned the case of athletes with prosthetic legs being disqualified due to their \u201cunnatural advantage.\u00a0 In that post, I concluded that the distinction of \u201cunnatural\u201d vs. \u201cnatural\u201d wasn\u2019t as obvious as it might seem. \u00a0Other extreme body differences, for example being a very tall female basketball player or a very short gymnast, are not considered unnatural or unfair. \u00a0The basketball example was also mentioned on the intersex call, in explaining the use of androgen counts to determine who has an \u201cunfair\u201d advantage. In women\u2019s sports, chromosome tests are no longer used to determine gender, but androgen tests are. \u00a0The idea is that having more androgens does positively impact athletic performance, so it\u2019s not fair to have athletes with \u201ctoo many\u201d androgens compete against women. \u00a0Of course, these athletes don\u2019t compete against men, either. \u00a0At the same time, athletes with unusual height, lung capacity, or other advantages are seen as \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cnatural.\u201d This says a lot about the way we view gender, and the way we set norms. \u00a0We separate athletes by gender because, on average, male athletes and female athletes have certain differences. \u00a0But at the same time, there are huge variations within those two genders, so that a perfectly \u201ceven\u201d or \u201cfair\u201d match would be difficult to find. \u00a0And really, why would we try? \u00a0If the point of high-level sports is to work to be the athlete with the most prowess, someone has to be better. \u00a0Many young people would love to play sports at that level, but their bodies don\u2019t allow them. \u00a0We\u2019re used to this idea. What we say to intersex athletes when we do tests like this is that there is some line that divides the \u201cnormal\u201d from the abnormal. \u00a0Folks with a certain number of androgens, like those who conform with their assumed gender, like those who have talents within a socially \u201cacceptable range,\u201d like those who run with legs made of muscle and bone rather than manufactured parts, are considered valid athletes and valid human beings. \u00a0Those who fall outside the range don\u2019t get to compete. It\u2019s not just intersex athletes to whom this restriction applies, by the way. \u00a0My ears pricked when I heard that androgens were being used as the deciding factor, because I happen to have a hormonal condition that affects my own hormone levels and I do not have an intersex condition. \u00a0I asked whether women with PCOS, for example, who might have elevated androgen levels, but would not be considered to have an intersex condition, could be disqualified on that basis. \u00a0The answer is yes. \u00a0I\u2019ll leave you to mull these thoughts over with me, and please do comment if you have anything to share on this topic!", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
