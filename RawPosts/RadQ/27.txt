There\u2019s no reason that gender should be the thing that dress reflects. \u00a0In our society, clothing is a very gendered thing, but I don\u2019t think it has to be. \u00a0For me, certain \u201cfemme\u201d clothes reflect my personal preferences best. \u00a0It\u2019s not about gender, it\u2019s about what I like. \u00a0I feel sexy in clothes that are labelled \u201cfemale.\u201d But wearing these clothes can be a traumatic experience for me. \u00a0Why?  People tend to read clothes as a gender marker. \u00a0It\u2019s hard to dress as femme and not be taken as female, especially when your body and facial features are considered \u201cfemale.\u201d \u00a0For me, dressing as femme is a radical act, but others\u2019 reactions to me in femme wear put me in a different place\u2013a place of shame, embarrassment, nerves, and feeling misgendered as female. \u00a0Societal expectations for women crowd around me when I dress femme. \u00a0I also feel the disappointment of those around me who are queer, trans, genderqueer, or attracted to androgyny. \u00a0I often feel that I am not attractive to those I want to be attractive to in femme clothing. When I wear suits and ties, I am hot shit in my community. \u00a0Femme women often come up to me, flirt, want to dance, want to get to know me. \u00a0Cute, androgynous individuals are a hot commodity among queers. \u00a0Others make me feel safe, wanted, and welcomed. \u00a0Often, they are physically affectionate, and I love that. \u00a0I love being petted and hugged up on and flirted with. Dressed in femme gear, I don\u2019t really attract femme women in the way I\u2019d like. \u00a0I want to be some powerful girly girl\u2019s adorable genderqueer arm candy, but I get skipped over when I\u2019m wearing a dress. \u00a0Their eyes go to someone in a tie, and I don\u2019t know how to approach anyone. \u00a0I just feel small and scared. \u00a0How can I express that what I wear has nothing to do with my gender or my sexual orientation? \u00a0I\u2019d need a sign. There\u2019s a lot of talk in genderqueer communities about \u201cmatching,\u201d figuring out how to look neither boy nor girl, or both. \u00a0But I\u2019d like to hear from those of us who look like we \u201cmatch\u201d the gender into which we were raised, and how to stay confident in our gender regardless of that.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 3 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
