Next, I\u2019d like to consider the policy implications of the question. The challenge here is to question whether gender differences have any utility from a policy perspective, while still respecting the lived experiences and claimed identities of those who identify as male or female.\u00a0 I can say that gender differences are illusory, that the \u201cbox\u201d created by a lump of traits is in many ways artificial, and that the weight put on certain traits such as secondary sex characteristics and hormones obscures the actual diversity that exists in our society.\u00a0 But while saying this, I have to recognize that the categories \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d do mean something for many people, perhaps most, and that these categories can be useful when setting policy, organizing, or doing activist work. So \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d can be helpful categories for practical purposes, but I would like to argue that an exclusively gendered perspective is bad policy. I think that in almost, if not all cases, we can look at a problem or a potential structure as activists, organizers, writers, or policy-makers and use a more nuanced strategy to plan an approach.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to take a challenge on its face and determine what the best way to define a population is for that given challenge, rather than picking gender as a default.\u00a0 Then, if gender is relevant, it\u2019s important to look at other factors, to determine whether the population is broader or narrower than \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale,\u201d and whether other types of groupings within those populations might have different needs. An exclusively gendered perspective tends to do two things: one, it leaves members of the relevant population out, and two, it erases subgroups within a population. The first point can be illustrated fairly easily with some examples.\u00a0 The definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is constantly coming up whenever a feminist group decides to hold a women-only event, or create a women-only space, or provide a service for women.\u00a0 Often, trans women are excluded in these cases, when trans women are frequently the members of the relevant population most in need of services.\u00a0 If feminist organizers were to use the thing they were planning (say, a safe space for women) as a starting point, they would inevitably see that trans women (and often, trans people generally) have an obvious need for that thing.\u00a0 Using a safe space as an example, the point is to create a space free of harassment, gendered insults, rape, sexism, etc.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to see how trans people aren\u2019t in need of this kind of space. Another obvious example is health care.\u00a0 Health care needs are difficult to segregate based on gender, because health care needs depend on a huge number of factors, including one\u2019s physical body, hormones, lifestyle, genetics, etc.\u00a0 When a health care service such as OBGYN care, pregnancy prevention counseling, or abortion is framed as a service \u201cfor women,\u201d those who don\u2019t identify as women are excluded from services they need.\u00a0 The doctor\u2019s office is a scary space for many trans, genderqueer, intersex, and otherwise gender-nonconforming people because there is no guarantee that the health care provider will respect an individual\u2019s gender, understand it, or provide appropriate services.\u00a0 If campaigns intended to address health risks and needed services used more gender-neutral language, even directly targeting trans, genderqueer, and intersex folks, they would likely be more successful in reaching the entire intended population. Health is also a good example of the second problem, that of erasing subgroups within the population in favor of the majority\u2019s (or most visible group\u2019s) needs.\u00a0 Gender and health don\u2019t just come up in the context of reproductive health services.\u00a0 Almost every time I read an article at work about public health, risks of disease, or prevention strategies, it is framed by gender.\u00a0 These articles almost always mention the relative risk for males and females, state that the risk is the same, or point out flaws in studies that don\u2019t include enough men or enough women.\u00a0 Because gender is used as a shorthand, I have no idea whether the reason for a differential risk is hormones, genetics, physical structures, brain chemistry, or something else, and thus I can\u2019t evaluate my own risk because I don\u2019t have a \u201cnormal\u201d grouping of all these things to create the \u201cfemale\u201d shorthand.\u00a0 But this isn\u2019t the only problem with the shorthand. Medical and public health studies very frequently have a race problem.\u00a0 In all but the largest studies, you\u2019ll see a mention that not enough respondents for at least one racial group were available.\u00a0 There are also invisible minorities that aren\u2019t mentioned\u2013people with disabilities, people with less access to healthcare, non-English speakers, indigenous people, etc. etc.\u00a0 People with common co-morbities are sometimes excluded from clinical trials, as well.\u00a0 A particular subgroup might be mentioned, but in almost every study I read, some important group is left out.\u00a0 When the study population is casually grouped as \u201cwomen\u201d or \u201cmen,\u201d someone may read the study and assume that the results apply\u2013when in fact, for example, a black working class women\u2019s likelihood of contracting an illness might be much closer to a black working class man\u2019s likelihood than to that of a white middle class woman. While it is obvious that resources are scarce, and no writer or activist or organizer can account for every single possible subgroup, it is important to consider one\u2019s limitations and make a note of them.\u00a0 It\u2019s also smart policy to consider the topic at hand, and then choose an appropriate way to categorize populations.\u00a0 If subgroups might have different needs, it\u2019s easy to at the very least point that out and suggest that others focus on those needs.\u00a0 If a gender group is being used for a particular reason, such as biology, mental health, emotional needs, physical strength, brain chemistry, or anything else, it\u2019s better to point that out directly than to use gender as a shorthand. Thanks for reading.\u00a0 If anyone has thoughts on these questions or suggestions on how to implement better policies, I\u2019d welcome a discussion in comments or on Twitter.\u00a0 You can find me @queerscholar.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 3 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
