Again, I find myself using an example of a queer celebrity in the media to argue the necessity of a truly queer movement.\u00a0\u00a0The more time we spend arguing that we are normal, \u201cjust like\u201d our opponents, the further we get from our policy priorities.\u00a0\u00a0When we allow hate groups to define the debate, they have already won. How can we turn this disaster around? Refuse to engage by framing our position around being like our opponents.\u00a0\u00a0We are not like bigots, homophobes, and transmisogynists.\u00a0\u00a0We embrace diversity.\u00a0\u00a0We fight with creativity and humor.\u00a0\u00a0We shift the ground under gender stereotypes and we regularly fuck with patriarchy.\u00a0\u00a0We don\u2019t accept conservative arguments that dehumanize us and\u00a0challenge our right to occupy our space. We\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer.\u00a0\u00a0Join us.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 3 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
