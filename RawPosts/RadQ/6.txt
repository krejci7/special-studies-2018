The post that follows is a detailed guide of specific steps you can take to make whatever data you work with more trans-inclusive, building off of the talk content. Skim through the list below and use any tips that you find applicable! I\u2019m drawing from my experience working with member and donor data at national non-profit organizations, but you can apply this advice to any kind of human-centered data you collect including data on customers, employees, patients, survey respondents, and app users. My starting point here is that trans people can show up in any data set, and so it\u2019s important to address the needs we have around privacy, comfort, and affirmation not as a special population but as a regular part of data strategy. Rather than othering trans people, consider our experiences an opportunity to improve your data collection, storage, and analysis practices for everyone! If you\u2019d like to hear more after reading the tips below, check out my speaking page for more information. I\u2019m hoping to do more \u201cdataqueer\u201d talks and workshops in the future.    Balance needs carefully when asking about gender  There is no one right answer to make your data trans-inclusive: what data you can respectfully collect and how you ask for it depends on your purpose Ask: what are my/the organization\u2019s/the company\u2019s present and future needs?  In what context will you need someone\u2019s name, pronoun, identity, gender marker, etc. for your current purpose or in the future? For example: if you need to book someone\u2019s flight or submit a legal form on their behalf, you may need to ask for a name that would be irrelevant if all you need to know is what someone would like to be called   Ask: why do I need this piece of data (for each piece you want to collect)?   Make sure the question you ask on your form or survey is both specific enough and general enough based on what you actually need to know Example: if you\u2019re trying to decide whether to ask if someone is \u201cLGBT\u201d versus trans-identified, consider whether you offer any additional benefit or tailored programming specific to trans folks, or whether potentially including trans folks separately in analysis could be beneficial and lead to more inclusion (rather than just wanting data for its own sake) Disclosure can be burdensome and risky, so do a cost-benefit analysis and be sure that any information you collect is for a purpose     Think ahead about potential changes to data structure  It\u2019s always harder to migrate data to a smarter structure later than it is to take the time to think about it now, so keep your future needs in mind  If you ask a broad question and later want more specific data, you will have outliers that you may have to discard\u2013for example, if you ask about transgender identity broadly and later want to do gender-specific outreach But if you ask a very specific question that you won\u2019t ever need, then later go broad, it\u2019s dangerous to assume that each narrow category goes neatly into the \u201cumbrella\u201d \u2014 for example, not all genderqueer people identify as transgender, and not all trans people want to be lumped under the \u201cLGBT\u201d acronym   Consider your audience in advance  Does your data collection question make sense to your entire audience? Is your question culturally inclusive (examples: masculine-of-center vs. \u201cAFAB trans people\u201d, inclusion of indigenous and non-white terms)? Ask actual members of the community and do your research   Consider offering alternatives to mediate the tensions between data that is possible to analyze effectively and allowing folks to self-define  For gender, you can offer male/female/something else but also offer a free text box for a more complete description If possible, let people identify with multiple communities (for example, someone can be trans, female, queer, and intersex simultaneously)   Develop an advanced plan for what to do if you receive external data that doesn\u2019t conform to your structure   Ask for gender, pronouns, and name contextually  Many trans people answer these questions differently depending on who\u2019s asking and why they want to know \u2014 for example, name might vary for:  Phone and mail correspondence vs. online correspondence, particularly if you live with someone who isn\u2019t aware of your trans status Official purposes such as filing legal documents, booking a flight, charging a credit card, or issuing a tax receipt: be as specific as possible about your purpose if you need this information and consider destroying later Public recognition such as a badge name or donor acknowledgement   Asking for this information contextually doesn\u2019t just benefit trans people \u2014 it works well for nicknames, married name, and those who use different names depending on cultural or social context Label fields as clearly as possible and keep original context on the backend  Give the user help text to understand what you\u2019re asking and how you\u2019ll use the data \u2014 and give them a chance to opt out If a backend field label doesn\u2019t say everything about how the information was collected, add a description \u2014 it\u2019s easy to get confused later    If you need a lot of alternative fields, you may want to leave them all visible to everyone as a teaching moment, or consider a link like \u201cI go by different names in different situations\u201d that allows folks to expand their options on a form without stigmatizing or othering Avoid value-laden and overly general language like \u201creal,\u201d \u201cbirth,\u201d \u201clegal,\u201d or \u201cpreferred\u201d \u2014 not only can it be offensive, but it\u2019s also easy to forget how you\u2019ve promised to use the data later and makes it hard to clearly update Train staff and volunteers so they\u2019re not surprised, for example, if someone has two \u201cdifferently gendered\u201d names or wants to change their name or gender identity in your database  This also helps when you\u2019re looking for duplicates in your data, since many folks who work with data aren\u2019t aware that two records with \u201cdifferently gendered\u201d first names could be duplicates!     Avoid outing and protect privacy  Honestly evaluate the security of your systems (technological and human) and be transparent with users about the degree of privacy they can expect Only take data that you actually need so users have a choice not to disclose sensitive information (optional fields are your friend!) If you\u2019re going to publish demographic statistics, make sure those you\u2019re collecting data from are aware and can opt out  Even if you have consent, be aware of sample size and find ways to smooth data or let a respondent know if publishing data that includes gender/trans identity might make their responses obvious (on satisfaction or HR surveys with few trans respondents, for example)   If you need information for a one-time purpose, such as name and gender marker for booking a flight, offer to destroy that data after a certain period of time for everyone or those who request it\u2013and make sure you actually do destroy it Train staff and volunteers to be aware of privacy concerns: even just sharing a list of legal names, for example, could be a huge violation of privacy   Replace othering with universal design   At an event, include pronouns on everyone\u2019s name badge Avoid asking for gender or a title (Mr./Ms./Mrs.) if you don\u2019t absolutely need it Make it very easy to update data such as name, username, or gender  Whenever possible, allow self-updating online  Make it clear how to update data, rather than burying the instructions While they aren\u2019t always, usernames can be gendered and thus as important to change as a first name  If removing the old data from the system entirely will possibly cause problems in the future, such as not recognizing a duplicate record with an old name and potentially using that name in the future, be transparent about your purpose for keeping the data, offer options, and lock the old data down to as few people as possible    Refuse to work with database or integrated platform vendors who won\u2019t provide the custom fields and update options you need   If at all possible, don\u2019t compromise on the data structure and plan you\u2019ve developed because a vendor standardizes fields Instead, spend your money with more flexible vendors   If you work with partner organizations or companies and share data, encourage them to adopt similar policies and practices around this data rather than designing your system to incorporate their more standardized data sets     Have additional questions?
