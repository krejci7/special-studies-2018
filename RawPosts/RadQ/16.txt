Being female doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re feminine, nor does being male mean that you\u2019re masculine.\u00a0 Perhaps this would be easier for some people.\u00a0 People do like to be able to identify and name gender.\u00a0 I\u2019ve said before that my gender is more about how I\u2019m read or named than how I experience myself.\u00a0 My gender comes out of how I\u2019m perceived.\u00a0 When I disclose that I\u2019m trans, I sometimes am asked, based on my femme appearance, whether I\u2019m a trans woman or a trans man who hasn\u2019t yet transitioned.\u00a0 When I explain that I\u2019m genderqueer, I\u2019ve been asked a couple of times what sex I was assumed to be at birth.\u00a0 I no longer am willing to respond to that question, because it\u2019s so irrelevant. Asher Bauer wrote a post a while back that I need to find where he explained that he\u2019s not transmasculine.\u00a0 As a femme transman, \u201cmasculine\u201d is not part of his gender as he experiences it.\u00a0 I think this would confuse a lot of people, but it makes sense to me.\u00a0 Coming into femme has\u00a0 been the biggest part of my transition, and my history isn\u2019t relevant to that.\u00a0 Whether I was assumed male or female at birth rarely matters; what does matter is the kinds of privilege I have based on how I\u2019m perceived.\u00a0 In spaces where I don\u2019t mention my transness, I\u2019m usually perceived as female because of how I look, which gives me a certain privilege.\u00a0 I also have a lot of privilege because I\u2019m white and college educated, and a whole host of other things.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to appropriate anyone else\u2019s experience, and I want to recognize that it is a privileged thing to be able to experience gender in the way I do. One thing I don\u2019t have, paraphrasing from my friend Stephen, is legible identity privilege.\u00a0 My gender is never going to be very obvious, and no one is ever going to see me walking down the street and think \u201coh, cool, a non-binary trans femme!\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m also not sure how many other non-binary trans femmes are out there, and whether there\u2019s enough similarity in our experiences to form community and camraderie around that.\u00a0 But I\u2019m very grateful to the trans men and women in my life who do offer that community and camraderie, and who accept that my gender is not something that is visible, though my femme-ness\u2013and through that, my transness\u2013is.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
