It\u2019s more of a decision to group oneself in a certain way than a concrete provable fact. This is a problem. We can\u2019t just let anyone who wants to medically transition. How would we know who \u201cqualifies\u201d if we just let anyone who believes themselves to be male or female access medical care for that gender? Transition would be rampant! (Or something.) Since we need a requirement to access medical care, masculinity or femininity might as well be the requirement. It\u2019s easiest to quantify your gender in medical terms if you present as masculine or feminine. Femme trans boys and butch trans girls are just confusing. Don\u2019t even get us started on those genderqueers\u2013especially those who aren\u2019t interested in a more androgynous. What do they even want? What kind of dysphoria could they possibly be experiencing? There is very little to be sympathetic to, here.  Now I know there are empathetic medical professionals, professionals who understand the difference between identity and expression, and those who don\u2019t think of trans people as requiring a certain level of tragedy and pity to medically transition. But sometimes, it feels like the profession is stacked against us.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Radically Queer"}
