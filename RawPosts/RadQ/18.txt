The idea bothers me because although the practical meaning of the term is more like what we call \u201cvital statistics\u201d in the United States, and is dry and deals with demographic data, the actual French term implies much more. \u00a0It bothers me that one\u2019s very being, one\u2019s \u201cstate\u201d or existence in the public arena is gendered. \u00a0Not only is it impossible to escape the gender binary in France due to the gendering of nouns and adjectives in the language, but your being in the eyes of the state must be either male or female (and is exceedingly difficult to change). Sadly, this is not surprising. \u00a0I am not surprised that discrimination is so important to us as a society that it bothers us not to be able to gender someone, because I live this every day. \u00a0Nor am I surprised that we aren\u2019t sure how to treat someone \u201cas a human being\u201d with no other data. \u00a0We\u2019re obsessed with gender as a framework to tell us how to behave, and many among us are deeply bothered when we get gender \u201cwrong,\u201d are confused about someone\u2019s gender, or find that someone\u2019s gender is changing. I would be curious to know if anyone\u2019s done a study on human interaction in online spaces where gender is not known, though I imagine it would be difficult to find many where gender isn\u2019t stated fairly early on in an interaction. \u00a0I do find it interesting that among queer and trans Twitter friends, I often don\u2019t know someone\u2019s gender, and am sometimes surprised when I learn it. \u00a0I imagine that some assumptions are made based on the online space\u2013gaming, for example, being principally male; Pinterest being principally female\u2013but it\u2019d be interesting to know how many spaces there are where that isn\u2019t the case. \u00a0I would love to learn that, even in tiny niches, human beings are simply taken as that, end of discussion.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
