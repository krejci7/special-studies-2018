There\u2019s been a lot of news lately about transgender youth and treatment of LGBT youth in schools. \u00a0Recently, Nightline aired a segment about Jackie, a 10-year-old transgender girl in Ohio\u00a0(TW for misgendering by the host). \u00a0Though not all trans* people claim their identities early on, it is obvious that there are girls in primary and secondary school who are treated by their parents and teachers as boys, as well as girls who may later transition to be boys, or may later determine that they are neither male or female. \u00a0While some schools may address gay and lesbian people in their history or health curricula, few talk about the wide range of gender identities that exist. It\u2019s crucial that we recognize this detriment in our education systems and advocate for change. \u00a0According to Injustice At Every Turn, 78% of kids who expressed a transgender or non-conforming gender identity in grades K-12 reported harassment. \u00a035% reported physical assault and 12% reported sexual violence. \u00a015% left school at some point (K-12 or college) due to harassment. \u00a031% reported some form of harassment by teachers or staff. \u00a0These numbers were higher for trans and gender non-conforming people of color. \u00a0Over time, these negative experiences as a student can lead to outcomes including poverty, homelessness, drug use, and suicide. What can we do? \u00a0Anti-bullying initiatives are one step, but they can\u2019t be the only one. \u00a0Trans* girls have a right to an education, which not only includes safety in school, but also recognition of themselves as human. \u00a0Curricula need to address the variety of gender and avoid gender essentialization and stereotyping. \u00a0This would benefit all girls, of course, not only those who identify or later identify as trans*. \u00a0Teachers also need to provide support and put themselves out there as available mentors for all girls. When I was a girl, I had no idea that genderqueer people existed. \u00a0I didn\u2019t learn about transgender until I was a teenager, and when I heard about third gender it was only in an international context. \u00a0No one ever suggested in school that gender identity can change over time, or that people don\u2019t have to have a body that \u201cmatches\u201d gender. \u00a0When I was ten, I wanted to be a boy and was heavily ridiculed to the point of being physically assaulted by my best friend on the playground, with the backing of the entire fifth grade class. \u00a0I\u2019m just one example, and things were undoubtedly easier for me than for a girl who is considered to be a boy by her parents and teachers, but the example is illustrative. \u00a0We need to do better. \u00a0Today, as we think about the rights of girls, let\u2019s not leave anyone out.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 3 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
