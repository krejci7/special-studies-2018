To paraphrase Flavia Dozdan, my trans activism will reject transmisogyny or it will be bullshit. It is not okay to talk about structural violence and systematic oppression in the abstract and then be a transmisogynist in your spare time.\u00a0 Part of being a radical trans activist is confronting your internalized transmisogyny and your own privilege, whatever kind of privilege that may be. I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m never hypocritical.\u00a0 Confronting examples of racism in my own actions that runs counter to my activism is an ongoing process.\u00a0 I benefit daily from a system of white supremacy, imperialism, and genocide.\u00a0 My entire life is built on the privileges I have as a white person born to white, college-educated parents with access to \u201cmerit-based\u201d scholarships.\u00a0 It is my responsibility to confront that and actively work against forces like structural racism, transmisogyny, etc. But it makes me angry when someone acts so uncritically, blaming and shaming trans women, and then uses their position as a respected trans activist to benefit and exploit.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
