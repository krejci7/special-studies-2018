One thing I just saw at work, though, in an interesting CDC report on health disparities, is a definite linguistic gaffe. Although Healthy People 2010 specifies that health disparities include \u201cdifferences that occur by\u00a0gender, race or ethnicity, education or income, disability, geographic\u00a0location, or sexual orientation,\u201d only a limited number of regularly\u00a0published national- or state-level health reports include information\u00a0on sexual orientation (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, or heterosexual identity) as a demographic variable for comparison. Since when is \u201ctranssexual\u201d a sexual orientation? \u00a0There are some differences in opinion on the meaning of words like transsexual and transgendered, but I\u2019m pretty sure most people commonly understand \u201csexual orientation\u201d to relate in some way to sexual desire and/or sexual partners. \u00a0Trans* identities, on the other hand, refer to an individual\u2019s gender identity. \u00a0Can we get this right, CDC? \u00a0It\u2019s bad enough to lump \u201cT\u201d in with \u201cLGB,\u201d while simultaneously ignoring trans peoples\u2019 needs and priorities. \u00a0But I think it\u2019s even more egregious to suddenly refer to trans* as a sexual orientation, as if trans people didn\u2019t have sexual orientations in addition to gender identity. \u00a0It\u2019s part of a broader trend of ignoring the sex lives of trans people and assuming that a trans person\u2019s identity is entirely constructed around hir gender identity/transition. \u00a0To me, it feels dehumanizing.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 3 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
