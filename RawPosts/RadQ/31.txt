Childhood, ideally, is all about play. \u00a0Children who are given safe spaces to exercise their curiosity and explore their surroundings as they grow up are more likely to be well-adjusted adults. \u00a0Adults, in fact, could learn something from children. \u00a0It\u2019s amazing how a problem changes shape and how solutions present themselves when you take a step back and approach the problem with your imagination guns a blazin\u2019. And that\u2019s the thing about childhood. \u00a0Imagination doesn\u2019t do well with boxes. \u00a0It\u2019s about exploring possibilities, playing, learning. \u00a0As we get older, society draws lines and we all learn where those lines lie. \u00a0We learn that boys do this and girls do this, and we learn behaviors that society considers \u201cappropriate\u201d to our gender. \u00a0And for those of us who don\u2019t feel 100% comfortable with our gender, it may take years to unwrap those neat little packages we\u2019ve been dressed up in and try to find who we are, independent of this thing called \u201cgender.\u201d \u00a0It may take a lot of play.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 4 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
