To me, this is an obvious \u201cyes,\u201d but perhaps it\u2019s harder for those who don\u2019t experience dysphoria to understand, so let\u2019s try an analogy.  Imagine that a woman is born without a vagina or a penis. I\u2019m simplifying here, as actual intersex biology is more complex than this, but let\u2019s say that our hypothetical little girl is born without identifiable characteristics of either common genitalia. Undoubtedly, it would be considered a serious issue and the doctor would assume that something needs to be done. In other words, once we decide (often non-consensually) that someone fits into the category of \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale,\u201d we\u2019ll go to desperate lengths to make sure they conform. There are still plenty of cases of parents deciding for an intersex child that she is female before she\u2019s able to consent, and authorizing surgeries to create a more recognizable or deeper vagina. But I also suspect that if our hypothetical child did not undergo operations as an infant, and then sought medical intervention as an adult woman with a fully developed gender identity, most anyone would be fine with that and insurance would cover it. Contrast this with another woman who is born without a vagina, but with a penis. We arbitrarily decide in this case that her confirmation surgery is medically unnecessary and that she falls into a different category from the first woman, even though they are both adult women who are seeking vaginal reconstruction so that their bodies align with their gender identity within our current societal framework. Suddenly, the surgery is cosmetic or elective, not a necessary medical procedure. Now, it\u2019s one thing to argue that society is the problem, and that all bodies should be accepted as aligned with the gender identity of the person inside, or to question the idea of a vagina aligning with a woman in the first place. But given the world we live in, where women who don\u2019t have those specific genitalia experience greater discrimination, abuse, and dysphoria, I\u2019d argue that for those who want such a procedure, it\u2019s medically justified regardless of whether the woman in question was born with intersex traits or with a penis and XY chromosomes.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Radically Queer"}
