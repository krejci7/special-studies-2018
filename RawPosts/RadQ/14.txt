One of the issues I\u2019m most passionate about\u2013the rights of trans people in prisons and detention facilities\u2013has been in the news lately. \u00a0It should be a chance to raise awareness around this important issue and to use media to push forward the tide of increasing respect for prisoners\u2019 fundamental rights that was evidenced in several recent events, including successful lawsuits in Wisconsin and Massachusetts around transition-related care in prison and the issuance of a final ruling on the Prison Rape Elimination Act that incorporates many of trans advocates\u2019 recommendations regarding trans prisoners. \u00a0But it was evident from the start that this would be a tricky story to bend in the direction of education and advocacy on the issues, because this is a story that most people just can\u2019t pull past Us vs. Them. The headlines that started rolling in last week range from more-or-less balanced to fear-mongering on the conservative opinion side:  Judge rules in favor for inmate\u2019s sex change operation (Boston Globe, Sep 4) Judge orders Mass. to pay for inmate\u2019s sex change surgery (Boston Globe, Sep 5) Ruling on prisoner\u2019s sex-change a matter of principle (Boston Globe, Sep 6) Judge goes too far in sex change ruling (Boston Globe, Sep 7) Is denying treatment to transsexual inmates \u201ccruel and unusual?\u201d (The Atlantic, Sep 7) Free sex change for prisoner is distasteful, but justified (Boston Globe, Sep 10) The real war on women\u2013rewarded for killing his wife (BernardGoldberg.com, Sep 10) Inmate\u2019s sex change: humane or insane? (Santa Maria Times, Sep 11)  The facts of the case make it tempting, even for transgender people and those engaged in trans rights work, to focus on the individual involved and how heinous it seems that the state would give someone convicted of killing her wife a \u201cfree sex change.\u201d \u00a0It\u2019s entirely understandable that those who can\u2019t access necessary transition-related health care due to the cost of that care and the lack of insurance coverage would find it frustrating when a prisoner is allowed access to the same care on the state\u2019s dime. \u00a0But to focus on Kosilek\u2019s crime, or on the idea of \u201cfree benefits\u201d for prisoners, is entirely missing the point. Yes, it\u2019s strange that someone in prison would have better access to healthcare than someone who hasn\u2019t been convicted of a crime, but the problem here isn\u2019t that a prisoner does have access, it\u2019s that many others don\u2019t. \u00a0Prisoners should have access to healthcare as a fundamental human right, and so should everyone else. \u00a0True, many people don\u2019t have that access right now, but access to human rights isn\u2019t about ranking people by how much we think they deserve a right and doling it out accordingly. \u00a0Healthcare access in this country depends on a lot of things\u2013structural inequality, economic opportunity, whether you can get insurance coverage, and whether your insurance covers the treatment you need, to name a few. \u00a0The Kosilek case was about a specific legal determination under one specific standard that gives prisoners in a particular jurisdiction access to health care. \u00a0The judge made the right call in this case. \u00a0There are many other cases, many other standards, that impact trans people\u2019s right to transition-related care in different situations, and many people don\u2019t have care yet. \u00a0That sucks, but it doesn\u2019t mean we should wait until all those cases are solved before we provide healthcare to trans prisoners. \u00a0It means that we need to hold our country to a standard of basic human rights in all areas. I also want to remind folks in general, but particularly some of the commenters on\u00a0Lesley\u2019s xoJane piece\u00a0who are heavily focusing on the idea of \u201cfree surgery\u201d or \u201crewarding prisoners,\u201d that it\u2019s the prison system itself that leads to this situation. \u00a0When people commit crimes in the United States, we handle it through incarceration. \u00a0We incarcerate people in facilities where if they are allowed to work, they can\u2019t make very much money and they certainly can\u2019t afford to pay for their own healthcare. \u00a0One of the consequences of that system is an enormous burden on the state, but that has nothing to do with the question of what necessary healthcare is. \u00a0There are other solutions to criminality, solutions that experts on prison abolition and reform can speak to far better than me. \u00a0If we provided some means for criminals to work and pay to access rights such as healthcare, then the argument might fly. \u00a0But we don\u2019t, and so it\u2019s the state\u2019s responsibility to pay for care. \u00a0The state is failing in other areas\u2013we don\u2019t provide adequate health care for the young, the old, the sick, non-citizens, or those with disabilities\u2013but again, the answer to failure in one area is not to fail in another. If this case pisses you off, if you\u2019re outraged, then great. \u00a0Excellent! \u00a0Join the fight for rights to transition-related care through Medicaid, Medicare, the VA, private insurance, and other programs. \u00a0Fight for expansion of the Affordable Care Act. \u00a0But don\u2019t spend your time arguing about this one trans woman who did a terrible thing and later won a petition for her human rights. \u00a0Frankly, it\u2019s a waste.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
