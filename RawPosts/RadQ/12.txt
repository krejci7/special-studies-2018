First, UK journalist Suzanne Moore published a piece in the New Statesman about women\u2019s anger, which included a throwaway line that justifiably got a lot of trans activists pissed off: \u201cWe are angry with ourselves for not being happier, not being loved properly and not having the ideal body shape \u2013 that of a Brazilian transsexual.\u201d Moore defended herself by saying that trans issues were not the point of the article and published a piece in the Guardian\u00a0where she called intersectionality \u201cits own rectum\u201d and attempted to sound like the sane, logical one focused on women\u2019s issues while implicitly casting the trans Twitterati as narcissistic and irrational. Julie Birchill then shored this opinion up in a more openly vitriolic way when she wrote the Guardian follow-up piece, Transsexuals should cut it out. Here\u2019s the thing: the Burchill piece clearly has one aim. It\u2019s there to stir people up. It\u2019s there to get the Guardian clicks (which is why I haven\u2019t linked the article; you can Google). It\u2019s there to sell ads. And while it pisses me off that the Guardian would publish such a thing, I also know what their business is. The thing that really gets me riled up is slightly different, and that\u2019s the fact that these arguments seem rational to some people\u2014that this hate speech is being put out there, on its own, without any kind of warning or counterpoint, and left to sit and seep into the brains of folks who really\u00a0haven\u2019t thought about trans issues. Blah blah, transsexual lobby, blah blah. Burchill openly insults us for funsies, but at the same time she and Moore are pushing an insidious, dangerous argument. The argument is that trans people don\u2019t care about women, that we are getting in the way of women\u2019s rights, that we are anti-feminist. The argument is that trans women, in particular, are so concerned about penises that they can\u2019t focus on the important issues of domestic violence, human trafficking, and women\u2019s rights generally. And it\u2019s important that we stand up and loudly proclaim that this argument is\u00a0bullshit. The scary thing is that to many, it will sound logical. And of course, it sounds terrible. To someone who\u2019s never interacted with a trans woman on a friendly basis, it\u2019s probably not so hard to jump to \u201coh my God, they\u2019re so selfish that they\u2019re ignoring domestic violence in favor of lobbying for sex change surgeries!\u201d We need to directly attack this strawman argument. We need to point out that many trans women are in fact actively engaged in women\u2019s rights issues that have nothing to do with trans identity. It isn\u2019t our fault that anti-trans feminists only notice trans women when they\u2019re talking about trans stuff, because that\u2019s what they want to pick on. A trans woman working against trafficking or DV doesn\u2019t make the news when the news is all about making fun of \u201cthose silly transsexuals.\u201d But even more importantly, we need to make it clear that transmisogyny is anti-feminist. And this has nothing to do with penises, honestly. It\u2019s about human rights, it\u2019s about casting trans women as less than human and how that is a patriarchal act. It\u2019s about issues that cis feminists talk about all the time: body image, gender stereotyping, women\u2019s dignity. Why do these arguments disappear when an anti-trans feminist is presented with a trans woman\u2019s body? We need to stand up in the media and shout about these hypocrisies. When someone starts dividing \u201creal\u201d women\u2019s rights from the \u201ctrivial\u201d ones, we have a big fucking problem. Say it with me, now. As a favorite Facebook group of mine proclaims,\u00a0Transmisogyny Is A Women\u2019s Issue!\u00a0Moore, Birchill, and their anti-trans feminist buddies are simply on the wrong side of history.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
