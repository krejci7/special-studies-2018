This thought was tumbling around a lot in my mind for a while, particularly in discussions of what it means to be femme and presumed as female, but also when cis folks would ask me about assuming pronouns when you\u2019re \u201cpretty sure you know\u201d someone\u2019s gender versus when it\u2019s unclear. As a starter, I\u2019ll say that if there is a legible identity privilege, it\u2019s certainly not anything like as strong as other privileges such as being white. As a white non-binary person, I am less vulnerable to violence and harassment than any black or brown person, full stop. I explicitly reject any arguments that white non-binary people make around \u201cbinarism\u201d putting them in a riskier place than a black trans woman, for example. See b. binaohan for why that\u2019s fucked up. But considering this as its own possible thing, I have a few thoughts. One is that, like \u201cpassing privilege,\u201d this has a lot to do with specific cultural context and how other people perceive you. The two are also related. A trans man who is presumed to be a cis man might experience \u201cpassing privilege\u201d alongside legible identity privilege, because he \u201cpasses\u201d for a cis man and also \u201cman\u201d is a legible identity. Conversely, a trans woman who doesn\u2019t conform to particular beauty standards and expectations might not \u201cpass\u201d for a cis woman, but could have a legible identity in cultural context\u2013it is clear to most people around her that she intends to be read as a woman, and she is a woman.  My own experience is that I do experience \u201cpassing privilege,\u201d because in most situations the people around me think that I\u2019m a cis woman and thus aren\u2019t going to be violent towards me or otherwise mess with me because of my gender, but I don\u2019t experience legible identity privilege, because I have a non-binary identity that does not \u201cmatch up with\u201d any particular outward expression. There\u2019s nothing I can wear that makes people think \u201coh, of course! squishy pink queer non-binary robot femme from an unknown planet, duh.\u201d  If this is a thing though, I think it\u2019s both a matter of degree, and probably results in fewer external consequences on its own than other kinds of privilege. The main consequence I\u2019ve noticed is emotional, the frustration of what Melissa Harris-Perry calls misrecognition. It\u2019s frustrating that I can\u2019t communicate my identity to others through my dress or mannerisms, but no one\u2019s going to deck me because my identity is illegible. Those who do experience violence because their gender expression \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201d to cis folks are suffering from the consequences of not \u201cpassing\u201d as a legible gender, I think, rather than directly from having an illegible identity. Folks whose identity is illegible might be less likely to dress in a way that leads to \u201cpassing,\u201d certainly, but not necessarily. I also imagine that a whole range of folks could suffer from not having full legible identity privilege, though degree may vary. Femme queer women aren\u2019t often read as queer, for example, by those outside the queer community. Butch women might be incorrectly read as men, or as non-binary. Straight femme men are often read as gay. But I\u2019m not sure this is quite the same\u2013there\u2019s probably a difference between having an identity that can\u2019t be communicated in our culture\u2019s language of signs and symbols and having one that could be communicated but the person doesn\u2019t feel comfortable expressing with the signs and symbols society deems to \u201cmatch\u201d the identity.
