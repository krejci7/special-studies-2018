The prison-industrial complex is not just a term of art. \u00a0It is a violent, oppressive system that is killing our community. \u00a0Police who have no training in cultural competency aren\u2019t just rude towards transgender people, but frequently violent and abusive. \u00a0Prisons don\u2019t know how to handle transgender prisoners, who are often housed in the wrong facilities, confined in solitary, denied medical treatment, and particularly vulnerable to rape. \u00a0We cannot forget those who are \u201clost\u201d to the system, and must be their unwavering advocates. The problem of suicide is a personal one to me, and difficult to address because I struggle with depression myself, often related to gender dysphoria. \u00a0It is difficult for me to conceptualize how others might help. However, this is a serious problem that claims too many lives, and beyond the general work we need to do to increase acceptance of gender variance in our culture, there are some solutions to make transgender and gender non-conforming people feel less alone. \u00a0Therapists, other medical professionals, and suicide hotlines that support trans* patients and have experience working with trans* people should advertise this and make themselves known in their communities. \u00a0Even for those of us who have the resources to seek professional help, the crippling fear of transphobia in the medical establishment can be too much to overcome without some sign that a provider will be understanding. \u00a0And of course, ordinary people, friends and family, can do a huge service just by listening, asking how to help, and not judging those who suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 3 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
