That said, I really wanted to get a quickie out there for the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, which is focusing on transphobia this year. \u00a0I thought this was particularly appropriate for me personally, because in the past year I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about gender identity and am very thirsty at this point to learn more. Though I was always conscious of the \u201cT\u201d in LGBT, I think I\u2019ve spent a lot of time being at least partially transphobic, and very trans-ignorant. \u00a0The Global Arc of Justice conference really helped me understand how broad the fight for transgender rights is, though, and some personal\u00a0acquaintances\u00a0as well as some books I read helped clarify what gender identity is really about. \u00a0There are a lot of different ways to experience gender \u2013 it isn\u2019t just male, female, FTM, or MTF. \u00a0Some people identify entirely as their \u201cdestination gender\u201d after transition, and don\u2019t want to be referred to in any other way. \u00a0Some identify strongly as transmen or transwomen. \u00a0Some prefer something more fluid, and don\u2019t identify as trans but rather as genderqueer or something similar. \u00a0Some go from being a \u201cstraight male\u201d to a lesbian, some from \u201cstraight female\u201d to straight male, some stay bisexual or pansexual the whole way through. \u00a0Though I don\u2019t think our society has very many set-in-stone stereotypes about gender identity, because we tend to simply cover up the variations, it\u2019s definitely a bigger world than I initially thought, and it\u2019s important to recognize these differences when thinking about discrimination, rights, and/or the law. There have been some great steps in the law lately, perhaps most notably the House\u2019s passage of the Matthew Shepard Act (c\u2019mon, Senate!) \u00a0A lot of people think of this as a hate crimes bill to protect gay and lesbian people, and it does expand our protection, but actually we\u2019ve already got a lot of it. \u00a0Trans and intersex folks have nada. \u00a0So this law would be a great step, but at the same time, there are a lot of things that need to happen that aren\u2019t happening. \u00a0We need to educate ourselves about gender and not be afraid to discuss it, to ask questions, to teach our kids about different gender identities. \u00a0We need to educate law enforcement (big time). \u00a0And those of us who don\u2019t really understand need to ask, read, educate ourselves, and become activists. \u00a0We also need to learn to listen. \u00a0I think a lot of people in the LGBT movement (myself being one) have a tendency to think we know what transpeople need (and intersex people, if we even consider their existence). \u00a0We lump transfolks into the gay rights movement and then get bitchy when they intrude on our women-only space. \u00a0I admit that when I first heard about the Michigan Womyn\u2019s Music Festival incident, I was a little unsure about my opinion. \u00a0I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted someone with a penis in a woman-only space, because I will freely admit that I hate and deeply fear the penis at this point in my life. But on the other hand, well, that\u2019s my problem. \u00a0I need to get over it, or not show up. \u00a0We don\u2019t have a right to identify as women if we\u2019re going to exclude others who choose to do so. \u00a0My own acceptance is coming along slowly, and I appreciate any help from trans, intersex, and genderqueer folk who have advice or opinions, but I also know that it\u2019s not your responsibility to fix my fuckups. \u00a0I think we all need to take responsibility for the discrimination and plain stupidity we\u2019ve exercised in the past, and figure out how to do better in the future. \u00a0Hopefully this year\u2019s IDAHO focus will be a strong first step.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 4 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
