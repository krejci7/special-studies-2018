In this post, I\u2019ll address the the theoretical question of whether gender differences exist, and then, in a second post, I\u2019ll ask the policy question of whether there\u2019s any utility to using gender differences on a practical level. So, are there gender differences?\u00a0 Well, yes, simply put.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t black and white, and of course we can\u2019t say that all men do x and all women do y about anything whatsoever.\u00a0 But there are observable trends, which is unsurprising given our tendency as a society to group absolutely everything by gender. These trends are both informed by, and perpetuate, our tendency to use gender as the primary category when we organize our world.\u00a0 They erase those of us who are in between male and female, or outside of that system, because there is a tendency to try to push anyone who doesn\u2019t fit into the box with everyone else.\u00a0 There was a recent post on Genderfork by someone who noted that zie is happy not passing, and I can relate to that, because there is so much pressure to \u201cpass\u201d as one gender or another, to climb into either box. Genderqueer people are still, for the most part, raised as one gender or another.\u00a0 We are also perceived, for the most part, as one gender at a time.\u00a0 Most people are not comfortable seeing someone as not gendered, or bigendered, or as a third gender, and so society encourages us to second-guess our own identity as falling outside of the gender system. As a genderqueer person raised female, I often have an internal struggle with things I enjoy, do, or wear that are categorized by others as \u201cfemale.\u201d\u00a0 I sometimes feel guilty when I do something that feels gendered\u2013for example, when I wear a dress\u2013but I have to remind myself that how I organize the world is a choice.\u00a0 I can consciously reject gender, and resist being labeled \u201cfemale.\u201d\u00a0 What I have to do is reject my brain\u2019s tendency towards confirmation bias\u2013that little societal trigger that sees a female behavior and tries to offer this as evidence that I am really female, that my alternate way of seeing the world is a sham.\u00a0 This built-in mechanism perpetuates gender categories, but categorization is always a choice. So back to the original question\u2013do gender differences exist?\u00a0 Here\u2019s how I see it. If most \u201cwomen\u201d see themselves in most of the traits that we label \u201cfemale,\u201d then a gender category emerges.\u00a0 The members of the category\u2013women\u2013don\u2019t have to recognize themselves in every trait, or even a vast majority.\u00a0 There might even be some female traits that no women, or very few women, relate to, but as long as there\u2019s a big bunch of traits that many women identify with, the category stays alive.\u00a0 If Woman A identifies with X and Y, and Woman B identifies with Y and Z, and Woman C identifies with X and Z, then we could probably come up with a category \u201cwoman\u201d that consists of X, Y, Z, and Q, and Women A, B, and C would likely go with that. Those minority traits sneak in there because women (or men\u2013the same is true for both gender categories) are encouraged to be silent about the traits that don\u2019t match them.\u00a0 There is pressure to be gendered, and so it\u2019s understood that there are \u201cfemale\u201d traits that not all women share.\u00a0 Another tendency is for subgroups like \u201ctomboy\u201d to form, so that those who relate to fewer traits still identify as female gendered, and don\u2019t rock the boat too much.\u00a0 Finally, some women may try to conform to traits they don\u2019t share, to feel more comfortable in their gender, with their peers, or for whatever other reason. Also, all traits are not created equal.\u00a0 Some traits have huge weight, making it hard for someone labeled \u201cfemale\u201d to consider alternatives.\u00a0 For example, a person who has breasts, hips, and a vulva, who menstruates and produces \u201cfemale\u201d hormones, is likely to consider these traits of far greater importance in determining gender than personality traits.\u00a0 Hence \u201cwomen can do anything,\u201d \u201cwomen can be aggressive,\u201d etc. rather than \u201cwomen can do everything men can do, but also there are other options outside of male and female.\u201d Personally, I have quite a vast majority of \u201cfemale\u201d traits.\u00a0 I have never identified with a transmasculine perspective, which is probably why it took me a while to identify as genderqueer and while I still don\u2019t identify with a genderqueer community.\u00a0 All things equal, I prefer \u201cfemale\u201d colors, fashions, and hobbies.\u00a0 I\u2019m shy and prefer to be the \u201cpassive\u201d one in relationships.\u00a0 I love baking.\u00a0 When I get emotional, I cry and am sad, and I almost never experience anger.\u00a0 Initially, I tried being more masculine to signal or bolster my gender difference, because it is so much easier to signal difference with clear cues.\u00a0 It\u2019s much easier to \u201clook masculine\u201d than to look agendered. When I read these articles comparing men and women, never mentioning alternatives or alternative ways of grouping human beings, I sometimes question the validity of my identity because I do see myself in a lot of the \u201cfemale\u201d traits mentioned.\u00a0 Beyond feeling erased because my chosen identity is never mentioned, being genderqueer takes away any authority I have to speak as someone who has the specific traits mentioned.\u00a0 I don\u2019t get to have an opinion because the article is about men and women, and I am neither.\u00a0 Like relationship articles with the \u201cheterosexual only\u201d disclaimer at the beginning, anything that contrasts two genders takes away my authority to speak on the subject, even if I see myself in the article in some other way. In part two, I\u2019ll ask whether the men vs. women distinction has any utility from a policy perspective.\u00a0 Please stay tuned!", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 3 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
