As we dig into 2012, I have several exciting things to announce.   First, a href=http://www.queerfeminism.comQueerFeminism.com/a has officially launched!  Focusing on areas where the feminist movement could improve, including queer/trans inclusion, anti-racism, disability, and decolonization, this is a collaborative site that welcomes contributions from anyone who has thought I wish feminism would do better with me and my community. Second, Ive been very pleased with participation in the Sunday Twitter chats I launched in the fall.  #transchat and #queerchat take place alternating Sundays, 2-4 pm.  Anyone can suggest a topic by contacting me on Twitter or just leaving a comment here. Finally, I have several cool workshops and talks coming up.  At Creating Change, the nations premiere LGBT organizing conference in Baltimore, Ill be leading a workshop Friday morning, January 27th, on incorporating ambiguous identities in queer organizing.  At Lavender Languages (Saturday, February 11th) Ill be facilitating a lunchtime workshop on the words used to describe non-binary identities and populations.  At Momentum (last weekend in March, workshop date TBA) Ill be leading Workshopping Your Sexual Orientation, a unique experience that will break your sexuality wide open.  If youd like me to speak on your campus or at your organization, let me know.  I still have spring dates available. Also, no details yet, but look for more coming from me at Gender Across Borders.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
