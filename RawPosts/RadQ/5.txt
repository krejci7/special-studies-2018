I keep hoping that consistent posting will one day become natural, that I\u2019ll be able to write and schedule posts every weekend, but that is just not a thing. I\u2019m being honest with myself about emotional and mental labor, and the fact that this world we live in doesn\u2019t give us enough time to heal and just be present outside of our paid working hours. I\u2019m also realizing that as an ADD adult, my attention span will never stick with a particular project for more than a month or two, and that\u2019s okay. This blog isn\u2019t going anywhere, though. I have a post scheduled for this coming week, in fact, about a really fantastic book I want you to read. I\u2019m just acknowledging that I\u2019ll probably never follow the best practices of posting regularly and self-promoting, that there will be spurts of activity and then months-long gaps as there have always been. But I\u2019ve also been blogging for more than ten years in some form, so I think that\u2019s likely to stay. There\u2019s another fact in here, which is that I\u2019m not totally comfortable being \u201ca voice\u201d in activist spaces when we don\u2019t as a community acknowledge the labor of people of color who are doing most of the work here. I recently wrestled with the question of whether to write a book about non-binary gender and ultimately decided that I am not the person to write that book right now\u2013because I don\u2019t have the time and energy to do a full, comprehensive survey of non-binary people, focused on the voices of people of color, and the world just doesn\u2019t need a white centered 101 to non-binary identity. I also think that if I do write that book in the future, I likely can\u2019t in good conscience do it without a co-author of color. Since I don\u2019t have collaboration/social spoons right now, I\u2019m instead stepping back. If you\u2019re hungry for queer voices, I recommend you start with checking out black girl dangerous\u00a0and proceed from there.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Radically Queer"}
