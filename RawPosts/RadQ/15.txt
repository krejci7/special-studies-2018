One of the things that I really love about the organization where I work is that we’re not afraid to use the word “moral” when talking about things like prioritizing the needs of the most marginalized, pushing for equality for trans people, and queer organizing.  Christian extremists have done an excellent job of co-opting morality in the public imagination, to the extent that when talking about trans pioneers in school, for example, is decried as “immoral,” we all know exactly what they’re talking about whether or not we agree. But there was never one morality.  Morality has always been subjective.  Morality relies on a system of beliefs, a value system of right and wrong, and the extreme Christian right version of morality is just one version.  What we need to do as a radical trans queer movement is take back that word and start talking about why supporting trans rights, particularly the rights of those who have the least power in our society, is an absolutely moral position.  We need to take that language back and start talking about how cissexist and transphobic people are immoral, and why it’s wrong to oppose our stance. I would love to hear any success stories from folks who have been able to use this language in their organizing, or any ideas you have about how to apply this strategy in practice.
