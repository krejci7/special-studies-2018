But there was never one morality. \u00a0Morality has always been subjective. \u00a0Morality relies on a system of beliefs, a value system of right and wrong, and the extreme Christian right version of morality is just one version. \u00a0What we need to do as a radical trans queer movement is take back that word and start talking about why supporting trans rights, particularly the rights of those who have the least power in our society, is an absolutely moral position. \u00a0We need to take that language back and start talking about how cissexist and transphobic people are immoral, and why it\u2019s wrong to oppose our stance. I would love to hear any success stories from folks who have been able to use this language in their organizing, or any ideas you have about how to apply this strategy in practice.", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
