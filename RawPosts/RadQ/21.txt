When I think about that, of course, I realize it\u2019s not true. \u00a0No one knows that for sure unless I tell them. \u00a0And I\u2019m thinking about the value of not disclosing that kind of information as a way to destabilize or deemphasize gender in our interpersonal relations. \u00a0What\u2019s in your pants is about as private as it gets, but we don\u2019t treat it that way. \u00a0We also make assumptions about bodies and medical histories based on a person\u2019s gender identity. \u00a0On the other hand, I think there may be value in my writing about my experiences as someone who grew up female-identified, because that background is a huge part of my trans* story. Anyone have experience with this, or has anyone changed approach over time?", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 3 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
