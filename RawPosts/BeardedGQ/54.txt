I was heading to get coffee with a friend down a back street in Seattle on a scorching hot day minding my own business with my headphones in. Suddenly I see a guy across the street calling to me and waving me his direction. I\u2019m skeptical but he seems friendly so I head to find out what he wants. Turns out he\u2019s the shop owner of LICK Pure Cream and wanted to take a picture of me because my fuchsia and purple outfit perfectly matches his shop. He pulls out a pink waffle cone and fills it with blueberry chai ice cream on the house and asks to take a picture of me for Instagram in his iconic yellow chair. He even asked my pronouns. Sometimes life really surprises you! **** Update 2017 \u2013 Sadly LICK went out of business so you can\u2019t go meet the wonderful owner there anymore. *** Also, I wanted to gush about how happy I am to finally have found some heel boots that fit! I\u2019m size 13W in women\u2019s and it\u2019s nearly impossible to find anything, much less something both comfortable and stylish. But these David Tate shoes arrived from Zappos last night and look fabulous so I geared my outfit today around them.", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 6 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
