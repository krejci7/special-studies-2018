There are dozens more\u00a0already being used and more being created every day to describe and categorize the diversity that we experience in real life.\u00a0I\u2019ve heard many people criticize identity labels and say things like \u201cwhy do I need more boxes to fit in\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t like to label myself\u201d. And while I\u2019m not trying to invalidate their experience, I want to share a bit about why I love labels and categories, especially for gender and sexuality. I think there is a lot of power in words. Words give us access to intellectual concepts and and language can be incredibly freeing when it is allowed to evolve and grow along with a society. For myself, I didn\u2019t grow up with the concept of gender being anything other than what you were told at birth and it existed as an assumed binary. I didn\u2019t know that trans people even existed until well into my teen years and I didn\u2019t learn about terminology outside the basic LGBT acronym until I joined a\u00a0highly controversial GSA-style group\u00a0at my conservative Evangelical university. Even once I had concepts for transgender and genderqueer, I didn\u2019t really\u00a0understand that there was diversity within those categories. I knew I didn\u2019t want to be a woman (or at least didn\u2019t think that was something I could access in any way that was meaningful to me but that\u2019s another whole post) but I didn\u2019t think I could be genderqueer either because I thought that meant I had to be androgynous in the sense that I couldn\u2019t have any visible genderedness about my body. So for many years I identified as gender non-conforming for lack of a better way of describing my blurriness. But as I began to add terminology to my gender toolbox I also began to see places where I might fit. It took until another trans person I was dating suggested that maybe I was genderqueer before I felt like it was something I could dare to explore. And even then it took almost a year before I felt comfortable claiming my place within the genderqueer and trans identities. Sadly, a large part of that was due to my\u00a0tendency to self-police my own gender and allow the \u201cnot trans enough\u201d feelings to guide me. But I also didn\u2019t understand that not everyone of a particular identity label has to look or feel the same. The key to unlocking my gender was grasping\u00a0that these are merely categories, useful for finding other people like you but also for pushing the boundaries together of what it means to not be a cisgendered person. Once I accepted that I didn\u2019t need to desire surgical or hormonal transition above all else and that I didn\u2019t need to lose all of my features that people ascribe to a specific gender (like my beard) I was able to accept\u00a0that being trans just\u00a0means not identifying with the (binary) gender you are assigned at birth. I was trans because I was not cis. I am genderqueer because I exist in a blurry space outside of the well-explored binary boxes. I am nonbinary because I don\u2019t want to be a man but I know I\u2019m not a woman. I may have been assigned male at birth but I can transition to be \u201cX\u201d. I can be feminine and have a beard. So don\u2019t let identity police get you down and tell you what you can or can\u2019t be, especially not based on appearance. And don\u2019t listen to those little shoulder devils whispering doubts in your ear about \u201cbeing enough.\u201d Claim the categories and terms that work for you\u00a0now and don\u2019t get hung up on how you might feel about your gender next year. It is OK to evolve and grow. It can be a step in your journey or it can be your final destination but either way it isn\u2019t \u201cjust a phase.\u201d", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 5 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
