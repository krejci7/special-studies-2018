For example last month I went back and forth quite a bit, as I often do, on whether I should grow my hair out to look more feminine or keep my curlyqueer cut with the close buzzed sides and long top. I ended up going short again because I know how to manage my curls that way, it takes less time, and I feel like myself that way. But I still question whether I would like myself with longer hair if I could get through the grow-out process or if I just think I need that so I am less likely to be read as male. Do most people think about societal expectations this much? Or just feminists? Or just trans people? I don\u2019t even know what is \u201cnormal\u201d anymore.", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
