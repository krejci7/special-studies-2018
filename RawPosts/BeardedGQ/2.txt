I don\u2019t necessarily feel like my brain is composed of part-masculine, part-feminine aspects. I very much feel like I was born with a girl\u2019s brain in what was perceived as a male body. Most people these days understand that femininity is broad and can encompass tomboys and people who don\u2019t wear makeup every day. And with the right body I think I would have made a great girl, although not one that could live up to the expectations of the cult I was raised in. And I\u2019m definitely a femme. I\u2019m perfectly happy to put on jeans and a tshirt when I\u2019m getting dirty or doing something outdoorsy. But I\u2019ll always opt for very feminine clothing whenever it\u2019s not extremely impractical. I\u2019m not someone who puts on makeup every day but I certainly love doing it when I have the time and I am very particular about my appearance. In other words, a fairly typical woman in my appearance preferences. So that just leaves my physical body. I\u2019m tall and I have a large frame with wide shoulders and huge feet and hands. So I feel like I could never fit into culture as a woman which is mostly why I don\u2019t try. It\u2019s the fear of rejection from other women that keeps me stuck in this in-between place. Not that women can\u2019t have that kind of frame either; my mom and my aunt certainly do although they often times get questioned in bathrooms about whether they belong because of it. They are 6 foot and 6\u2032 2\u2033 respectively and my aunt has size 13 feet as well. So if they can do it, why can\u2019t I? As I\u2019ve said a few times before, I keep my beard mainly because it covers up masculine features of my face that I really don\u2019t like. Somehow the facial hair gives me less dysphoria than the underlying face. But I wonder if I also keep it as a signal to the rest of the world that I\u2019m not trying to pass as a woman so they won\u2019t judge me by that unattainable standard. I guess I\u2019m scared of the ridicule trans women so often get so I try to avoid it by doing my own thing. So then is nonbinary just a phase I\u2019m passing through on the way to becoming a woman? It\u2019s hard for me to say at this point. And just because it\u2019s a phase doesn\u2019t make it any less valid. It\u2019s where I\u2019m at right now and that\u2019s all that really matters. I\u2019ve found that no matter how much I try to plan, life seems to throw a wrench into the gears and redirect me. So I\u2019m just going to take this one step at a time. I\u2019m starting estrogen in 20 days and I\u2019m curious to see what that does to my brain and my body to shape how I relate to them. Who knows. One day I may need to rename this blog. But for now I remain your Bearded Genderqueer. PS \u2013 I mostly maintain this blog as a way of shaping my own thoughts. When I start to have big gender feels I often come here to write about them before I\u2019ve even fully thought them through. I wasn\u2019t consciously aware of half the things I just wrote before I got there. So thanks for following along in my very confusing journey.", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
