A place where nonbinary people can fit in and transitioning voices can be supported. I can\u2019t remember exactly how I got the idea but I think the seed was planted by a post in my local Facebook Queer Exchange over a year ago asking about queer/trans choirs. I had already done some searching and realized that there weren\u2019t any small acapella groups that felt like a good fit for me and I don\u2019t fit well in choirs with binary categories (as wonderful as the Seattle Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s choruses are). I\u2019m usually the type of person to just make things happen. I don\u2019t exactly crave leadership but I\u2019m also not afraid to step up when there is a void. But for some reason my brain kept getting in the way of this idea. I could find a million reasons not to do it right now \u2013 I\u2019m getting married, I\u2019m planning a family after that, I was moving, I would need a whole infrastructure with a director and accompanist, etc. But I really do miss singing and I know I\u2019m getting rusty. Last week I was in a workshop where the facilitator was speaking about the importance of doing the things that you love and fulfill you. And I know I\u2019m not prioritizing that in my life right now as much as just trying to get through the basics of chores, self-care, relationship building, and wedding planning. When I brought it up with my therapist she really encouraged me to just scale down my dream to something that can happen now and jump in to see what happens. I luckily already had a dinner planned with the friend I knew could help make this happen. And after explaining my idea they were ready to jump in with me! So now I\u2019m in the process of gathering a group and I already have a dozen interested people! I\u2019m really excited to see what comes from this. If you\u2019re in Seattle, are trans/nonbinary, and a trained singer who can read music, feel free to\u00a0contact me if you are interested in joining.", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 3 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
