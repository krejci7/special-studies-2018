Today I\u2019m wearing Walking Cradle flats, cool patterned socks from Sock Dreams in Portland, my partner\u2019s jersey knit skirt, a comfy sleeveless turtleneck blouse, and my partner\u2019s sweater (it sure is handy to date a femme who is the same size in some things). It is so comfortable I\u2019m not even sure how it\u2019s legal to walk out of the house this way! It is seriously comparable to my pajamas. People who have never tried\u00a0skirts really are missing out on how freeing they can feel. And I used to think good jeans were the standard of office comfort!", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 5 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
