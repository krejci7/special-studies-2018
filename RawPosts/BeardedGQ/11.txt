I\u2019m loving the outfit I\u2019m wearing and how it emphasizes my gorgeous legs. My shirt makes it look like I have great breasts and it shows just enough chest to make me feel good. And I\u2019m wearing the shoes that never fail to get compliments. Some days it feels great to be me.", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
