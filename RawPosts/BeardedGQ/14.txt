The What 
Here’s an excellent tumblr post on the difference between drag as important form of gender exploration, particularly historically, compared to the highly problematic modern drag culture as popularized by Ru Paul’s Drag Race. It definitely reflects my discomfort with that culture and the nuance that is required in discussing it especially when there are some amazing drag activists like Mama Tits. This is particularly important: “For drag queens, womanhood is an exploitable, caricaturized performance. For trans women, womanhood is an identity. Drag culture is essentially gender appropriation.”
