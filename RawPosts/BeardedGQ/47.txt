And I was going to try to come up with some deep gender insight this week based on all the thoughts swirling in my head. But instead I decided to be honest about why I haven\u2019t written. It\u2019s been a tough couple of weeks for my mental health. I have the interesting challenge of living with a combination of anxiety, depression, ADD, and OCD. I\u2019m what you might call \u201chigh functioning\u201d which can be useful but also means I often forget to engage in the type of self care that would keep me that way. But I have been trying to do more of that. To give myself a break from the chaos of unpacking my new home, to get off social media for a bit, and to do things like playing video games and watching TV with a new cat in my lap. But it is hard to overcome the various external and internal messages that can trigger debilitating anxiety and depression. Last week I had a few days where I was really struggling with the \u201cnot enough\u201d messages. I felt like I wasn\u2019t good at my job and it was only a matter of time before they figured it out and fired me. I felt like I wasn\u2019t a good partner and soon\u00a0my\u00a0partners\u00a0would realize\u00a0I\u2019m actually really boring. And one day didn\u2019t feel like I was trans enough to wear a dress so I wore a more masculine outfit which then caused me to later feel like I wasn\u2019t trans enough because I wasn\u2019t wearing a dress. It was an overwhelming day! During that time I KNEW logically that those messages weren\u2019t true. I get validation at work all the time that I\u2019m on the right track and I\u2019m good at what I do. And I know my partners love me and are choosing daily to be with me. And I\u2019m writing a whole frickin\u2019 blog about how \u201cnot trans enough\u201d is total bullshit! But yet\u2026 Luckily my therapist reminded me that those feelings are OK to have, even if they aren\u2019t true. And that those kinds of doubts are even part of the official physiological diagnosis of \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d that I am submitting to insurance. Periods of transition and intense gender exploration can bring those more to the forefront and make them louder. But that doesn\u2019t make them any less false. I\u2019m also in this place where the horribleness of the world (and particularly the U.S.) is really getting to me. I know some of it is that I\u2019m just more aware now of the reality that most people have been facing their whole lives. But I still have a hard time figuring out if I feel\u00a0depressed and despairing because the world is so terrible or if the terribleness of the world is just emphasized and oversimplified because I\u2019m depressed. So I\u2019m here sharing this with you to remind you to take those vital mental health breaks. To engage in self care in a radical way that allows you to go back out into that terrible world with enough energy to face it. It\u2019s not selfish to take care of yourself because without that you wouldn\u2019t have anything to give back. It\u2019s like putting on your own air mask before helping the person next to you. One way I\u2019ve been doing self care is by beginning to read Jeffrey Marsh\u2018s new book, How to Be You. It\u2019s very affirming to read and I\u2019m getting lots of ideas for new posts which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see soon. I\u2019m also very encouraged by how much positive feedback I\u2019ve gotten on this blog. After only a month and 8 posts, I\u2019ve had 950 views from 370 readers. Thank you all for being there for me and listening to my ramblings. Until next time!", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 5 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
