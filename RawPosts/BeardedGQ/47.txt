Both because I didn\u2019t own enough to not repeat and because I didn\u2019t feel comfortable doing that at work before. But with the support of my boss and the acceptance of my team, I bought some additions to my wardrobe and wore skirts to work for 5 business days in a row.       I was really nervous about wearing skirts at work, especially the first time I met with the researcher I support. He has responded well to my gender fluidity at work but he is a middle aged white doctor from the rural midwest. But I have felt supported here and encouraged by my amazing partners to continue pushing boundaries and exploring the more feminine side of my gender. What I\u2019ve found so far is that I\u2019m most comfortable in long skirts and I have a fair amount of discomfort and nervousness about wearing anything above the knee, especially with my hairy legs. Yes, I could shave but with how fast my hair grows that takes a big commitment. I have shaved them before and I love how it feels but not as it grows back. I did shave my chest for the first time this week to see if that made me more comfortable in feminine blouses that might expose some hair. I found that when I looked in the mirror like that it didn\u2019t feel like me. It exposed my very masculine distribution of belly fat in a way that felt like it emphasized my dysphoria. On the shortest skirt I ended up wearing tights\u00a0which was a very professional look but wasn\u2019t comfortable physically and didn\u2019t feel like where I wanted to be gender-wise. Luckily fall weather has started here in Seattle so now I can go back to wearing sweaters which give me a great androgynous look.", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 5 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
