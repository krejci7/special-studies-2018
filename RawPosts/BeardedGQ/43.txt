The What 
I hope to write more later this week but for now I just wanted to gush about how comfortable my outfit is. Today I’m wearing Walking Cradle flats, cool patterned socks from Sock Dreams in Portland, my partner’s jersey knit skirt, a comfy sleeveless turtleneck blouse, and my partner’s sweater (it sure is handy to date a femme who is the same size in some things). It is so comfortable I’m not even sure how it’s legal to walk out of the house this way! It is seriously comparable to my pajamas. People who have never tried skirts really are missing out on how freeing they can feel. And I used to think good jeans were the standard of office comfort!
