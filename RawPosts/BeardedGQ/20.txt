I wrote about my depression a little bit but mostly I didn\u2019t have the mental energy to write a lot here since November. The short version is that the combination of the bleak political situation with the record rain and dark, long days we\u2019ve had in Seattle forced me to confront the fact that my depression isn\u2019t just situational. There are definitely things that make it worse but it\u2019s clear that it is a bigger problem than just something wrong in my relationships or at work. My personal life is objectively better than it ever has been and yet I barely had the energy to get through the day most of the time. But I did what I\u2019m best at \u2013 I used my resources and courage to look for solutions. And luckily, I didn\u2019t just look for a simple quick fix. It took a combination of a lot of factors to bring me out of it. I\u2019m recording them here partly for my own sake so if/when this happens again I can recall what worked, but also to hopefully inspire others to take some steps towards radical self care. First off, I have been seeing a great therapist since the beginning of last year who has helped me find ways to break patterns of anxiety and recognize my triggers early enough to help get out of the cycles. But even the best self soothing and awareness only seems to work for me when I\u2019m dealing with the \u201cnormal\u201d amount of mental health challenges for me. When I add the layer of depression on top of my anxiety, ADD, and PTSD, I get stuck. So I found myself a psychiatrist (well technically an ARNP) and started working on finding the right antidepressant for brain. The first try with Lexapro was disastrous \u2013 I had a bunch of side effects including worsening anxiety. And even with the second try, Zoloft, it took a long time to find the right dose. But now things seem to have leveled out and I can tell there is a huge difference in my ability to self manage my mental health. Another important factor was (re)engaging heavily in my core relationship building. Being depressed can take a heavy toll on the people around you and I know I was much more irritable for a long time and my libido was way out of wack. Things aren\u2019t perfect but now I can confidently say I\u2019m feeling a sense of secure attachment and I can see the growth and evolution of my relationships instead of stagnation. I have two romantic relationships that have passed the two year mark and I\u2019ve built a chosen family around myself that can weather a lot of change. One aspect I didn\u2019t anticipate being such an important key was my physical health. I tend to be pretty good about going to the doctor but I had stopped going to the chiropractor last year due to money and schedules. My back and neck clearly weren\u2019t ready for that though because as I was trying to track my mood for medications, I noticed an unusual pattern. My anxiety was peaking shortly after I arrived at work and again at the end of the day. It turns out that was when my neck pain was worst and it was so bad that it was breaking down my ability to manage my mental health. So I found a new chiropractor who I\u2019ve been seeing weekly and it is making a world of difference. Finally, at my therapist\u2019s encouragement, I took steps to bring things back into my life that ignite my creativity and passion. I am starting a\u00a0trans acapella group and even though we haven\u2019t met yet, I can tell the excitement of that is giving my mental health a big boost. The weather and longer days are of course helping too but between all these factors, I am radically better than I have been in months. My energy has returned, I don\u2019t need to constantly take time every day for pain management, and I can be myself finally. This in turn gives me motivation to do more things that I love like open myself back up to new dating opportunities and see friends more. The positive feedback loop of well managed mental heath sure takes a long time to get going but I\u2019m glad it has finally kicked in.", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
