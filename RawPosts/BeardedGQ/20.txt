“I dream of femme-inist worlds and futures and pasts where everyone (regardless of their gender identification) can be understood as a victim of a profoundly (trans)misogynist, gender binarist, and patriarchal world — where we can understand these things as systems that we are all indoctrinated in and produced through, where we can move away from talking about “male socialization” to talking about “misogyny socialization,” and how we are capable of doing patriarchal harm to one another and how the task then is how we create/remember new/old/different ways of relating, treating, caring, and laboring for one another.” – Alok Vaid-Menon
