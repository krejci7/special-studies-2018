Right up there with \u201cso you were born male?\u201d I found this great quote in an article talking about hormonal cycles that really resonates (though it is from a binary perspective). Trans women are not men who decided to become women, we are women who were forced to live as men until we could find a way to express the truth of who we are. I don\u2019t understand men, or know what it\u2019s like to really be one. Because I always knew I wasn\u2019t. Not everyone has always known that they were trans; I certainly didn\u2019t. But neither was I \u201csocialized as a man\u201d in the same sense that a cisgender boy is. Yes, I have some insight on what kinds of things are said to boys to enforce masculinity. But my experience of them is uniquely shaped by my nonbinary gender. When I was taught about what I was supposed to be, I didn\u2019t hear them as things that I could actually achieve. Masculinity was this unachievable standard that I\u00a0never felt like I could reach, even in the times when I thought I wanted to. But more importantly, masculinity wasn\u2019t something I really wanted. Even the \u201csensitive men\u201d in my life who didn\u2019t display toxic masculinity had some indescribable maleness that I admired but more like in the way that I hear cis women describe attraction to men. I\u2019ve tried many times to write down what I think masculinity is outside of the hegemonic hypermasculinity. But for each quality that I name, I can think of a woman who displays it just as well or better without compromising her femininity. So I don\u2019t have an easy way to tell you what I felt like I was missing that made me not fit as a boy/man. But I always knew I didn\u2019t fit, couldn\u2019t fit, and deep down didn\u2019t want to fit.", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 5 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
