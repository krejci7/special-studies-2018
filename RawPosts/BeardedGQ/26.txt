People will often say things like \u201cyou guys,\u201d \u201cdude, it would be\u2026\u201d, or \u201cthanks man\u201d around me out of habit, quickly realize their potential faux pas, and clarify that they meant it in a gender neutral way. This is also a conversation I see in trans spaces a lot. So here\u2019s my take on it. Personally, and I must emphasize here that I do not speak for all trans or even AMAB nonbinary people, I have chosen to accept gendered terms like that as gender neutral in a context where they clearly would have said the same thing to a cisgender woman. Context is key though because there are definitely ways of saying them as an intentional form of misgendering or because you don\u2019t see someones gender. So I can\u2019t really give you a clear hard-and-fast rule on whether you should use them around me. In general, I highly recommend trying to move away from using those words. While you may mean them in a gender neutral way, we all hopefully know by now that intent is not the same as impact. If you use them around many transgender people, they may get angry or upset, even if they don\u2019t tell you. And that is a completely legitimate reaction to have. They are not being \u201coverly sensitive\u201d or \u201clooking to get angry;\u201d using traditionally gendered language around trans people can be a form of microaggression. Microaggressions are like mosquito bites \u2013 individually they aren\u2019t that bad, merely annoying. But if you get a bunch of them, the effect adds up quickly and can make you irritable, mad, or even dangerously ill. The same is often true for trans people and gendered language. They may have what seems to you to be a disproportionate reaction to something you unintentionally said. But what they are probably reacting to is the cumulative effect of the constant misgendering they get on a daily, if not hourly, basis. So many of us have to fight so hard to be seen for who we are and when things happen to remind us that we still aren\u2019t seen as fully a woman or legitimately not a man (or the reverse), it can be very triggering. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve only been fighting for public recognition of my gender for a couple years or maybe it is because I am trying to ignore my hurt feelings. But just because one nonbinary person says it is ok, doesn\u2019t mean that you should keep doing it. Correcting your language is very very hard; I know that just as well as anyone. I am making an effort right now to be more aware of the ableism in my turns of phrase, not using words\u00a0like \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cstupid,\u201d but I am making very slow progress. Most of the time I don\u2019t catch it until I\u2019ve said it, at which point I try to correct without making a big deal about it. You can do the same thing with traditionally gendered terms. Rather than waste your energy on trying to emphasize the evolution of language to explain why it is now gender neutral, simply correct yourself with a different phrase and move on. \u201cYou guys want to play a game? \u2026I mean ya\u2019ll?\u201d Same thing with pronouns. Don\u2019t launch into a huge apology, just correct mid-sentence if possible and keep talking. Hopefully this PSA has been helpful.", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 3 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
