But I believe in the power of seeing people like you and feeling like you\u2019re not alone. So I\u2019m putting myself out there to share a bit about my nonbinary \u201ctransition\u201d such as is is and my thoughts as I seek to become more fully myself every day. When I search things like\u00a0genderqueer fashion or\u00a0androgyny I usually don\u2019t see myself or anyone like me in the results. We\u2019re in a new frontier when it comes to gender identity \u2013 not that there weren\u2019t people like us before, we just didn\u2019t have the wealth of language to describe it or the visibility. But as has happened with homonormativity,\u00a0it seems to me that the AFAB dandy has become the fashionable icon of androgyny and masculine-of-center presentation is the default assumption. Not that there is anything wrong with that look, in fact I think it is very attractive on many people. But I don\u2019t see myself represented and I don\u2019t see many AMAB\u00a0femmes visible in mainstream queer culture. That\u2019s part of why it took me until I was 26 to realize that I could be genderqueer and that my beard and my body didn\u2019t exclude me from being nonbinary.  There are a few notable exceptions and visible figures who I look up to and admire -people like\u00a0Jacob Tobia, Jeffrey Marsh, and Alex Drummond. I appreciate them being the pioneers of fashion and making the world a safer place for me through their openness and vulnerability. I don\u2019t want to become a public figure like them but I do want to share in that vulnerability by putting myself outside my comfort zone and showing a bit more of what my daily life is like as a bearded genderqueer. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m here and starting this blog. I\u2019m not special and I\u2019m certainly not\u00a0as confident as most people think I am. I often struggle with not feeling queer enough or trans enough. It takes a lot of bravery to walk out the door into non-queer spaces\u00a0wearing a dress and a beard. I am pretty much guaranteed to garner stares wherever I go, even in Seattle where we have a high density of trans people. And that attention, even when it\u2019s not malicious, is exhausting. Simply going to the grocery store dressed as myself takes a lot of energy and I don\u2019t always have what it takes to do it in every space. So to everyone else out there who struggle with the same things I want you to know you are not alone. We are here and we are genderqueer. But that isn\u2019t easy and it\u2019s ok to be kind to yourself and it\u2019s ok to hide your gender in unsafe spaces or even because you don\u2019t have the energy that day. You are trans enough, even when you\u2019re not presenting how you feel like you should.", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 6 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
