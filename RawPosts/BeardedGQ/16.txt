I was almost late for work this morning because the first outfit I tried on was pinging my gender dysphoria and after hemming and hawing for far too long I finally decided to switch outfits. Something about the loose fitting slacks and the way my shoulders seemed to stand out just wasn\u2019t working for me. I felt bad about not being able to wear an outfit that was probably really cute, at least according to my partner. But I ended up switching to some tight fitting jeans, a floral top, and my black heel boots and now I feel sexy as fuck. On a whim I grabbed my new subtle lipstick as I walked out the door and I was feeling so confident by the time I got to work that I applied it in the men\u2019s room. It felt so wonderfully subversive which for me is what being genderqueer is all about. Now I feel powerful and confident in my gender and appearance. I\u2019m glad I listened to my feelings and took the time to change this morning.", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
