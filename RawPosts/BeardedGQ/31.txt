Stuck in a cycle of short term thinking and unable to envision\u00a0my long term future, goals, and dreams. For the last couple months\u00a0I have been trapped in cycles of anxiety and depression that feel all-consuming. There are days when I feel like everything has always been terrible and will always be terrible even though I intellectually know that is not true. There are good days too. I am surrounded by amazing and supportive friends and chosen family. And I am staying connected with my bio family and feeling loved by them. I take time for self care and I go to fun events. But mostly I have been focusing more on cultivating close friendships and relationships and insulating myself more than usual. I\u2019m still not sure if my anti-depressant is working. But I do know that any long term solution involves getting my mental health to a more manageable state. Particularly regarding gender. I know I am not yet where I want to be but I don\u2019t know what next steps would feel affirming much less safe. I want to stop focusing on the little things that need solving now and be able to see the big picture again. But how do I get there?", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 4 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
