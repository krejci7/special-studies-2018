I can\u2019t recall any details about gender. As near as I can tell, I don\u2019t have a gender in my dreams. I don\u2019t think about what I\u2019m wearing or who I am, I am just me interacting with the world in a relatively neutral way. Even if I\u2019m dreaming about situations like conservative weddings that would normally be extremely stressful for me to determine a wardrobe, I don\u2019t have that particular anxiety in my dream. Not sure what it means but I\u2019m curious if other people have the same experience.", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 4 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
