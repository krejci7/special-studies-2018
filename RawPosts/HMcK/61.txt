I cannot tell you how much money I\u2019ve spent over the course of my life in purchasing the wrong size of something.\u00a0 Working up the courage to talk to a salesperson in a store has changed my life, not only in expanding my wardrobe but also in overall change in my confidence.\u00a0 In my experience salesclerks have been extraordinary helpful and have gone out of their way to help. However, I have to say I have never had an experience like the shopping experience I had yesterday.\u00a0 Last night the MN T-Girls had our monthly outing and we were treated to a private shopping event by the wonderful staff at Long Tall Sally in the Mall of America.\u00a0 Long Tall Sally is a clothing boutique that carries clothes designed for women 5\u20198\u201d and taller (up to size 20) and sells shoes that range from 10 \u2013 15.\u00a0 Basically, it\u2019s a haven for girls like myself.   Shopping can be an intimidating event as we\u2019ve all needed to work up our courage to simply start building a wardrobe but also in navigating a new world of sizing.\u00a0 However Wanda, Cindy and Kiersten couldn\u2019t have been more amazing.\u00a0 The event started after the store closed to regular shoppers and for the next two hours they helped us find clothes, put outfits together and helping a few of us buy their very first pair of heels.   The event was a success on so many levels\u00a0 There were about 15 of us and we all had an amazing time shopping, talking, trying on clothes and meeting new friends.\u00a0 I fell in love with two dresses, one of which is perfect for Saturday night, the other perfect for Sunday morning.\u00a0 I will let you decide which is which.  I really want to thank the members of the MN T-Girls who come to shop and have fun, and I really want to extend my thanks and appreciation to Long Tall Sally and their incredible staff.\u00a0 It was such an amazing night and the staff provided incomparable service and an unforgettable experience.
