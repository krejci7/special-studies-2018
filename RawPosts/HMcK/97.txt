An anti-transgender bill was introduced in the Minnesota House on Wednesday that could scale back gender-inclusive schools policies across the state if passed.You can read more about this proposed bill here. Also, Texas and Kentucky have filed new bills to restrict transgender bathroom usage.  More on that here… I have a feeling this is just the start… Love, Hannah
