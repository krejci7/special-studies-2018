Non-binary is the term that describes individuals that do not identify as neither male or female.\u00a0 This is different than gender fluid which, as defined by the Urban Dictionary is \u201ca gender identity best described as a dynamic mix of boy and girl. \u00a0 A person who is Gender Fluid may always feel like a mix of the two traditional genders, but may feel more boy some days, and more girl other days. \u201c As someone who thinks about gender a lot, especially when it comes to gender roles and how (some of) society will impose, enforce and expect certain behavior and clothing depending on the gender we\u2019re presenting as, I am fascinated by non-binary people and how society and the legal system are reacting. California is considering adding a third gender option to their state identification cards.\u00a0 Newfoundland is set to hear a case for birth certificates with a non-binary option,\u00a0 and Canada will now allow gender-neutral passports for non-binary residents. Traditionally, gender is assigned at birth, but obviously gender can change not only legally but also physically and emotionally.\u00a0 Sometimes my gender can change throughout the day.\u00a0 They say gender is what is between your ears, not your legs. I am thrilled to see such progress made, or at least considered for those who identify as non-binary.\u00a0 Any acceptance, legal or otherwise, is positive news for all of us who may not identify with traditional gender roles.
