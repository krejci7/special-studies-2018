The monthly MN T-Girls outing was yesterday and you couldn’t have asked for a more beautiful day.  It was a reminder why we are the MN T-Girls, and not, I don’t know, the FL T-Girls.  Days like yesterday are why I live here. A few months ago, we were invited to attend a play put on by the Uprising Theatre Company for a production of ‘Sex in the Dark’, a play focusing on intimacy after transition, but unfortunately the timing did not work out.  Having always wanted to attend a play en femme, I was excited that we were able to attend a performance of their current production ‘Prometheus Bound’.  It was a small group, just myself and two others but the three of us were treated to amazing performances, particularly by Shahd Elkhier.   The crew was wonderful and friendly.  I was really impressed with not only the play itself, but also by the social awareness of Uprising.  I really encourage you to see the causes they champion for. Thank you to Uprising for the invitation, for the causes you support and for a wonderful evening! Love, Hannah
