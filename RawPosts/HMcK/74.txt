If you can go, please go.\u00a0 If you can\u2019t attend, there are ways to have your voice heard in other ways.\u00a0 For example, OutFront Minnesota is urging supporters to call their Senators and Representatives. If you go, drop me a line.\u00a0 I\u2019d love to hear about your experience. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
