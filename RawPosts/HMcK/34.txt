When we are ready to come out, we open up to different people in different ways.\u00a0 Sometimes it goes wrong,\u00a0 sometimes it\u2019s anti-climatic, sometimes they already knew, and sometimes we just have a hard time explaining ourselves to others.\u00a0 Sometimes this is a conversation that takes months, sometimes the person we come out to never wants to discuss this ever again. If you\u2019ve come out to someone, what has worked?\u00a0 What did you say that describes who you are so perfectly that the other person understands exactly who you are?
