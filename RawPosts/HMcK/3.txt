First of all, there is no such thing as not being trans enough.\u00a0 There\u2019s no qualifying exam. Got it?\u00a0 Good.\u00a0  It was explained to me a few years ago that the term \u2018transgender\u2019 is a big, fabulous umbrella that can cover a wide variety of gender identities and that when someone does something that is outside of stereotypical gender norms that are usually associated with the gender that is assigned as birth that it falls under being transgender. So, a big tough construction worker that wears panties?\u00a0 Transgender.\u00a0 A 20 year coffee shop barista that paints his nails?\u00a0 Transgender.\u00a0 Someone who spends two hours on their makeup and selecting an outfit and styling their wig to hit the mall?\u00a0 Transgender. Being transgender is a hard thing to explain as it can cover quite a wide spectrum.\u00a0 We may all be trans, but my trans-ness is likely different than yours.\u00a0 Sure, Laverne Cox is transgender and so am I, but there\u2019s a world of difference between she and I.  I highly recommend watching this little video that nicely summarizes many of the terms that our community has.\u00a0 Thanks to Jennifer for sending this over.
