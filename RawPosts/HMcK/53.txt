Last week was one of those times. I booked a photo shoot with Shannonlee and spent a wonderful four hours with her taking pictures at Casket Arts, a beautiful building in Northeast Minneapolis.\u00a0 I packed some outfits and high heels, and after an outstanding makeover at Rita Ambourn, I was ready for my photo shoot.  I had a wonderful time.\u00a0 My face hurt from smiling and I cannot wait to see the photos.\u00a0 I wanted to share some pictures from the day\u00a0 I hope you like them!
