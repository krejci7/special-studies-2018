I love these quasi-holidays, like Pink Day last month.  Today is National Lipstick Day and I thought it’d be fun to learn about your favorite lipstick.  I fell in love with MAC’s Liptensity Lipstick recently, particularly the BRIGHT RED Mulling Spices shade.  I pair it with their Kiss Me Quick lipliner for a really bold look. What do you like? Love, Hannah
