Today was the monthly outing for the MN T-Girls and it was a very special event.  Last year we booked a professional photo shoot with the amazing photographers from Fotofida Studios, Shannonlee and Melina.  We had so much fun last year we did it again today!  I’ve been lucky enough to work with Shannonlee on several photo shoots, particularly for the modeling work I’ve been doing with Glamour Boutique and it was super fun to work with her again. The day started off with a makeover with Ulta and after that, the fun really got started.  There were a total of five of us getting our photos professionally taken.  Many pictures were taken, many outfits were worn and our faces hurt from all the smiling. It was an amazing day and I can’t wait to see the final pictures!  Until then, enjoy some behind the scenes fun. Love, Hannah
