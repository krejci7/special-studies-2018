Last night about fifteen of us gathered for drinks, food, holiday music, girl talk and fun.\u00a0 It was a time to take a break from the busy holiday season, show off our new sparkly Christmas and look back on 2017.\u00a0 In addition to using the night as an excuse to be fabulous, we also sponsored a family who has had a really hard year.\u00a0 Because of the generosity of the group, we were able to give a family a hopefully brighter holiday by donating money and gift cards.\u00a0 Seeing the T-Girls open their hearts and purses to this family who has been struck by tragedy made my heart soar.\u00a0 Thank you to everyone who helped. I had such a fun time and I spent a bit of the evening reflecting on all the amazing things we did this year as a group.\u00a0 I made a lot of new friends and had a lot of new adventures.\u00a0 We talked about what we want to do next year and I am excited and recharged for our next events.\u00a0 Organizing and planning a group like this is exhausting but it\u2019s also one of the most rewarding things I\u2019ve ever done.\u00a0 Thank you to every MN T-Girl out there for making the group as successful as it is.    I can\u2019t wait for 2018! Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
