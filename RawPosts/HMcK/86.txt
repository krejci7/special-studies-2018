It was such a small thing, but seeing my name written on a Starbucks cup was one of the most memorable moments of my life.  Seeing ‘Hannah’ written under a lipsticked kiss coffee cover was such  a thrill. Our names are important.  They have power, they give us power.  Usually our names are something we chose.  Sometimes they are the names we would have been given had we were identified as female at birth. Sometimes someone else gives them to us.  But the power comes from us having a name, a real name to this side of us that is usually a secret to almost everyone else in our lives. It’s funny, when I talk to other t-girls, we chat about shoes, makeup, shopping…but we also talk about deeper things, like our family, whether or not this side of us works in our relationships, or politics.  But our names are rarely discussed.  How did you get yours? Love, Hannah
