Creating your wardrobe is one of the most fun and expensive things you\u2019ll ever do.\u00a0 It will be even more expensive if you don\u2019t purchase clothing that is the right size.\u00a0 It\u2019s important that you know your measurements and understand that the size on the tag doesn\u2019t mean very much as each designer and store can have a different meaning of what a size is. So, how do you find your measurements? Find a measuring tape (not the tool kit kind, the ribbon kind) and take your measurements for different parts of your body: -Waist measured at your belly button -Bust measured at nipple height with or without forms/padding -Chest measurement taken just under pectoral muscle (2 to 3 inches below nipple)  I have a section on my blog that goes into more detail about shopping and sizing.\u00a0 Read that section here. The internet makes it very convenient to purchase and ultimately return clothing if it doesn\u2019t fit. \u00a0 It\u2019s important you refer to the size charts on the store\u2019s site in order to choose the right items.\u00a0 I found a really cute dress on Amazon recently, but I know from experience to look at the size chart. Here\u2019s a typical screenshot from Amazon:  Under the price, you can choose the size you\u2019d like, as well as view a size chart.\u00a0 This is a standard Amazon size chart and is rarely relevant.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I ignore this.\u00a0 Usually on the left side of the screen, among the alternate views, you\u2019ll see the manufacturer\u2019s size chart and will vary from dress to dress.\u00a0 This is usually more accurate.  I also will scroll to the bottom of the page and read the customer questions and reviews to see other shopper\u2019s opinions.\u00a0 I normally wear a size 12 or a large (unless it\u2019s stretchy, then I go down to a 10), but according to this chart I am a size XL. Taking a few moments to do you research will save you time and money. Happy shopping! Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
