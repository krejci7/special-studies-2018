From Huffington Post: What’s believed to be the first manufactured transgender doll is about to make its debut at a New York City toy fair, and it’s based on Florida transgender teenager Jazz Jennings, star of the reality TV program “I Am Jazz.”  This is pretty amazing.  If you had told me  when I was a kid that there would be a trans doll, I never would have believed you.  Am I the only who used to dress Ken dolls in Barbie clothes? Love, Hannah
