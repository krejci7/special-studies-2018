A few months ago, we were invited to attend a play put on by the Uprising Theatre Company for a production of \u2018Sex in the Dark\u2019, a play focusing on intimacy after transition, but unfortunately the timing did not work out.\u00a0 Having always wanted to attend a play en femme, I was excited that we were able to attend a performance of their current production \u2018Prometheus Bound\u2019.  It was a small group, just myself and two others but the three of us were treated to amazing performances, particularly by Shahd Elkhier.\u00a0\u00a0 The crew was wonderful and friendly.\u00a0 I was really impressed with not only the play itself, but also by the social awareness of Uprising.\u00a0 I really encourage you to see the causes they champion for. Thank you to Uprising for the invitation, for the causes you support and for a wonderful evening! Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
