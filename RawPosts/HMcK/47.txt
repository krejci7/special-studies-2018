Today the MN T-Girls had our monthly outing.  It was a dreary, rainy Saturday and we spent the day at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts looking at beautiful artwork.   We’ve been to this museum before and we’ve always had a wonderful time.  If you haven’t been, or planning on visiting Minneapolis, I highly recommend making a trip here.   It’s easy to lose yourself in such a massive building and before we knew it, two hours had passed.   It was time for an early dinner and we had a wonderful meal at The Lowry in Uptown.  We have been to many restaurants in the last few years but this was one of my favorites. It was a wonderful way to spend a rainy day.  Thanks to everyone who came and I look forward to our next adventure! Love, Hannah
