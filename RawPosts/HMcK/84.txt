I remember reading about Miss Vera’s Finishing School for Boys Who Want to be Girls around the time I was graduating high school.  I was thrilled and astonished by such a school and wanted to go there so badly.  I tried to find out as much information I could about Miss Vera and a little later I found a copy of her book.  I must have read it a million times before it was tossed in a purge.  Thankfully, I own it again, along with her second book. Last year I read about a similar organization in Japan called the Onnanoko Club (Girls’ Club) that that, according to the article, ‘is not a drag bar with theatrical outfits and shows, but rather a relaxed space where a man can arrive straight from the office, perhaps in a suit, and indulge his feminine side with a complete transformation.’ NPR has an article about Miss Vera that is totally worth your read.  Has anyone hear visited Miss Vera or a similar place?
