Please suggest something that helps me to full fill my desire to become a girl without knowing anyone. As someone who has been dressing, to various degrees, for decades, I understand needing to be discreet.\u00a0 For myself, freedom to dress came with age.\u00a0 You stated you are 19 so it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume you still live at home.\u00a0 When I had my first apartment I was able to buy heels for the first time and to start building a wardrobe without having to purge it every few days out of fear someone would find the new skirt I bought. I also understand the need to keep both gender identities secret.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to be seen at the mall looking at dresses in male mode, so thank goodness I can shop online.\u00a0 I wish I had that option when I was your age. If you want to keep your dressing a secret, you really have only two choices. -You can get your own apartment.\u00a0 I understand that is easier said than done, but that\u2019s the reality.\u00a0 I suppose you could just hide your clothes somewhere in your room where they are unlikely to be found and only dress when no one else is home, but there is still a chance someone will find out. -Get a hotel room and dress in private.\u00a0 This is expensive and not exactly feasible, but it is a choice. I wish I had more helpful advice.\u00a0 I will say that it gets better, and easier, once you have a place to call your own. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
