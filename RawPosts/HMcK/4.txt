The girls visited Midwest Makeup Supply in the Uptown neighborhood of Minneapolis for a day of beauty, makeup lessons and shopping.\u00a0 Midwest Makeup Supply is owned and ran by Corrie, a rockstar in the Twin Cities makeup world.\u00a0 She does everything from bridal to special effect makeup to drag makeovers.\u00a0 She also does complete gender transformations and will soon have a new photography studio in the Saint Paul area.  This was our second visit as a group to Midwest Makeup Supply and it was just as incredible as the first.\u00a0 Corrie started the afternoon with three different makeup demonstrations showing us everything from color correcting/beard cover, highlighting, and contouring.  Corrie then moved onto teaching us how to have fuller lips using liner and lipstick and some tricks for our eyebrows.\u00a0 I learned so much about everything from finishing sprays, foundation to primer to bronzer. After the demonstrations were over, it was time to shop!\u00a0 Corrie and Nico helped us all pick out the right foundations, powders, eye shadow, makeup brushes and everything else.  After we all maxed out our credit cards we went across the street for dinner at \u2018It\u2019s Greek to Me\u2019.\u00a0 In addition to amazing food we were also treated to incredible hospitality and were made to feel very welcome. Huge thanks for Corrie and Nico and to all the t-girls who came to the event.\u00a0 I can\u2019t wait to play with my new makeup! Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Hannah McKnight"}
