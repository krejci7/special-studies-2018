Before I was comfortable leaving the house, I always thought of Halloween as the perfect excuse to dress up and hit the town.  I thought that if anyone saw me they would just think that I was in a costume. But as I’ve gotten more confident with being who I am and more comfortable with going out, I have developed a complicated relationship with Halloween.  I don’t feel I need Halloween to dress up and go out.  In fact, I don’t like being Hannah on Halloween.  I am not a costume. But I also understand that for many of us, this is the perfect time to finally go out as who we are. What do you think about Halloween? Love, Hannah
