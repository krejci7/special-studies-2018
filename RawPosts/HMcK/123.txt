This is a pretty interesting article from NPR about a transgender police officer in Washington DC.  Officer Hawkins talks about some of the things almost all of experienced…from dressing up in childhood to the fear of coming out.  Reading about a member of the trans community doing what many people view as a very masculine job really puts things like gender roles in a new light. I encourage you to read it.  She also talks about transitioning and how not only did she change, her family did too. Love, Hannah
