Last year I read about a similar organization in Japan called the Onnanoko Club (Girls\u2019 Club) that that, according to the article, \u2018is not a drag bar with theatrical outfits and shows, but rather a relaxed space where a man can arrive straight from the office, perhaps in a suit, and indulge his feminine side with a complete transformation.\u2019 NPR has an article about Miss Vera that is totally worth your read.\u00a0 Has anyone hear visited Miss Vera or a similar place?
