Uncategorized crossdressing Glamour Boutique modeling photos transgender 
Not too long ago, I announced that I would be doing some modeling work for Glamour Boutique, a store that sells clothes, breast forms, makeup and shoes designed for the crossdresser and t-girl community. I am thrilled to reveal some of the final photos that I shot with Minneapolis photographer Shannonlee of Fotofida.  I’ve done quite a few photo shoots with her already and it’s always a thrill to work with her. I am excited to share some of the final photos from that day.  These and other photos are up on Glamour Boutique’s newsletter and website but you can also see more here.  I hope you like them, too! Love, Hannah
