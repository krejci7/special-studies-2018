I like to keep busy and I am almost always doing something.\u00a0 Sitting on the couch watching tv is not something I do very often.\u00a0 I do like to read and I stay active by running, biking and working out.\u00a0 Although I feel I have two halves of my life, I try to maintain a balance between them and not let crossdressing dominate my life, despite what my website suggests.\u00a0 Balance is important especially when you are married. Balance with anything in life is tricky, especially to crossdressers who are newly out to their significant others.\u00a0 When we come out to someone, especially our partners, it can go many different ways.\u00a0 Sometimes our partners are willing to see how crossdressing will affect their relationship and will allow us to wear panties or dress at home or set boundaries.\u00a0 Many relationships are damaged when limits or boundaries are broken.\u00a0 Crossdressing alone usually doesn\u2019t lead to a broken relationship.\u00a0 I hear from many t-girls that their relationship was damaged when they violated the boundaries their wives set, such as being asked to not post pictures online or leave the house.\u00a0 Lying to your significant other, whether about crossdressing or anything else never helps a relationship.\u00a0 If a crossdresser has a supportive partner, it is so easy for us to just go from zero to sixty with this.\u00a0 All of a sudden our drawers are filled with lingerie and our closets have dozens of dresses in them.\u00a0 This can lead our partners into thinking where will this end and wondering what they have gotten themselves into. Usually a crossdresser gets one chance to bring this part of us into a relationship.\u00a0 If we let this part of us dominate our lives or overwhelm our partners, it can lead to some very hurt feelings.\u00a0 So, we especially need to keep balance in mind because it is not fair to our partners or significant others or wives. I will take this moment to remind all of us that if you are not married, please, please, please tell your partner about this part of you before you do get married.\u00a0 It is not fair to spring this on them after you are wed.\u00a0 I fully believe in putting all cards on the table before you commit to each other. Anyway, balance. I have a friend who loves football.\u00a0 He met a girl a few years ago who also loved football.\u00a0 He thought he hit the jackpot.\u00a0 She loved watching the games, loved tailgating, wore her jersey proudly and knew as much about the teams as he did.\u00a0 They met and fell in love over a shared interest they were both passionate about.\u00a0 He was thrilled he found someone who supported his hobby. After a while, football really took over his life.\u00a0 Whenever a game was on, he\u2019d watch it.\u00a0 All weekend he\u2019d sit in front of the television watching sports.\u00a0 He\u2019d go to the home games, he\u2019d go to Fantasy Football drafts, he lived and breathed football.\u00a0 It was all he talked about.\u00a0 His wife\u2019s interest, however, didn\u2019t keep up with his.\u00a0 It got to the point where she was exhausted by it.\u00a0 It dominated their relationship.\u00a0 Everything was centered around the game.\u00a0 They\u2019d fight about it, she was frustrated by how this took over their life and she was simply overwhelmed by it.\u00a0 Although she loved football, she grew weary of it and hated that she lost her husband to something. He on the other hand was confused by how she had changed.\u00a0 He thought she was into football and thought she was supportive of his passion for it.\u00a0 Unfortunately he let it dominate their lives.\u00a0 It was all he talked about, all he watched, all he did. Having a supportive significant other is a wonderful thing.\u00a0 Whether they are supportive of a hobby, a job, or crossdressing.\u00a0 The thing we all need to remember is that we can\u2019t let anything take over our relationship.\u00a0 When many of us come out to our wives, we find it hard to talk about anything else.\u00a0 I was careful not to let this overwhelm my wife with this side of me.\u00a0 I tried not to talk about it constantly.\u00a0 Sometimes it was hard and sometimes I wasn\u2019t paying as much attention to her as I should have and didn\u2019t pick up on her thoughts and feelings.\u00a0 Through honesty and communication we found a very balanced life when it came to my crossdressing.
