Uncategorized Frock magazine 
I am smiling ear to ear because I have been featured in the November issue of the e-magazine Frock.  Frock is a free, award winning, bi-monthly, digital magazine that’s aimed squarely at the transgender and drag communities.  There’s a short bio of me as well as some photographs of my recent modeling work with Glamour Boutique. You can read the latest issue here! Love, Hannah
