I\u2019ve worked with these amazing photographers a few times over the last year or so and I am always impressed with their talent.\u00a0 They make getting your photo taken so much fun.\u00a0 I am thrilled to show the first of the three dresses I wore that day.\u00a0 I hope you like them!", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
