Not only that, there is also Senate Bill 179 which, according to Huffington Post, also reportedly makes the process of an individual changing their gender on legal documents easier by no longer requiring a statement from a physician declaring that they\u2019ve undergone\u00a0\u201cclinical treatment.\u201d So, any readers in California thinking of making this change on their identification cards?
