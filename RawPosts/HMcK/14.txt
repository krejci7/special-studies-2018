I know what you\u2019re thinking\u2026.that I need to drop a few pounds before I could wear it, but to be honest, I didn\u2019t think that was it.\u00a0 The zipper had this annoying little catch that didn\u2019t allow the zipper to go up all the way, even if I wasn\u2019t wearing it. Determined to wear this dress, I actually had the zipper replaced\u2026but it was still giving me trouble.\u00a0 I looked into all sorts of tricks to help a zipper glide more smoothly but nothing worked. I really wanted to wear this for my recent photo shoot, so I took the dress out of the closet, and zipped the zipper up and down about a million times and it seemed to have gotten the kinks or whatever out of it.\u00a0 The first time I was able to get the zipper up while wearing it was a wonderful experience. I love how these photo turned out and I can\u2019t wait to wear this again! Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
