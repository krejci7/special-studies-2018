I was surprised to get an email on Thursday stating my blog was named one of the Top 100 Transgender Blogs on the web.  You can see the entire list here, my blog comes in at number 51. All silliness aside, I am stunned and honored and humbled to be recognized, especially considering the other blogs on the list.  Thank you to my readers! Love, Hannah Hannah sitting pretty at spot 51
