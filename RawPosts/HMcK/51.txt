We\u2019ve been to this museum before and we\u2019ve always had a wonderful time.\u00a0 If you haven\u2019t been, or planning on visiting Minneapolis, I highly recommend making a trip here.   It\u2019s easy to lose yourself in such a massive building and before we knew it, two hours had passed.   It was time for an early dinner and we had a wonderful meal at The Lowry in Uptown.\u00a0 We have been to many restaurants in the last few years but this was one of my favorites. It was a wonderful way to spend a rainy day.\u00a0 Thanks to everyone who came and I look forward to our next adventure! Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
