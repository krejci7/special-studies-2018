My father was a very typical man of the time\u2026dominating, loud, angry and very mean.\u00a0 To children, their father sets the standards of what a man is \u201csupposed\u201d to be.\u00a0 To see these musicians at a young, impressionable time was nothing less than life changing.\u00a0 Perhaps life affirming might be a better phrase because all of a sudden I didn\u2019t \u201chave\u201d to be anything.\u00a0 There were others besides myself that didn\u2019t want to be what a man was \u201csupposed\u201d to be. NPR has an interesting article about these artists and how they redefined gender roles and it\u2019s really worth a read. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
