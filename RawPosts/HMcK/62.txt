Are you still with me?\u00a0  Some of you are on a journey.\u00a0 Perhaps a year ago you were working up the courage to try on a pair of heels, but these days you are on hormones and working on your name change documents.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think I am on a journey anymore.\u00a0 I think I am at the end of my journey and have arrived at who I am and will be for the rest of my life.\u00a0 I enjoy being able to go between genders when I feel like it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to commit to one gender.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to transition.\u00a0 I never wanted to. That being said, when we come out to others in our life, who we come out to may have a flood of emotions and thoughts.\u00a0 The internet is a wonderful tool and we all turn to it when we need something.\u00a0 It\u2019s entirely likely who we come out to will google terms like \u2018transgender\u2019 and \u2018crossdress\u2019 and receive a lot of information.\u00a0 Not all of it is helpful, of course.\u00a0 Looking up information on crossdressers online can easily give someone the impression that it\u2019s a fetish or a sexual turn-on.\u00a0 And it very well may be for some of us, but it\u2019s not the case for everyone. Thanks to the abundant information online, it\u2019s not uncommon to think that everyone who identifies as transgender will eventually transition.\u00a0 It can get exhausting coming out to someone as we have a need to not only explain who we are, but we also have the additional work of pushing back against some common misconceptions of who all trans people are.\u00a0 \u201cYes, I am transgender.\u00a0 No, I am not gay.\u00a0 No, I don\u2019t want to transition.\u201d Years ago, I came out to a friend who only knew me as a male.\u00a0 She was supportive and happy for me and it was a relief to have that kind of response.\u00a0 I wanted her to know Hannah as well.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard not to feel like I am a different person when my lips are bright red and wearing heels, you know?\u00a0 A few weeks ago the two of us went out to dinner so she could meet me for the first time. I wondered how dinner would go.\u00a0 I was meeting my friend who I have known for twenty years as a male but this was a new experience for her.\u00a0 There\u2019s very, very few people who know me in both genders.\u00a0 I am out to very few people in my life but very few of them have met Hannah.\u00a0 I needn\u2019t have worried.\u00a0 Dinner went wonderfully.\u00a0 She used my preferred pronouns and called me Hannah. It was embarrassing to be wearing the same colors as someone else at the same restaurant. After dinner I drove home and thought about how important it is to be understood.\u00a0 Yes, there are things that all people who identify as transgender have in common, but I felt that it only took an hour for her to understand who I am.\u00a0 She knew more about me over one dinner than weeks of internet research could provide. \u00a0 The internet will teach you about what being transgender means, but the internet can\u2019t teach someone about who YOU are. This is not meant to knock the internet, of course.\u00a0 The web has some amazing resources for people like us, and for people who are in our lives.\u00a0 I\u2019ve written before about being considerate of those we come out to, but when others start getting to know us, really getting to know us, we must be considerate of what they are experiencing.\u00a0 It can be a shock seeing someone they have known for decades wearing a dress.\u00a0 Not all of us have people in our lives who want to meet our other halves.\u00a0 If you\u2019re lucky enough to have someone who wants to meet \u201cher\u201d, please be gentle and considerate.
