Hi, thank you for visiting my blog! My name is Hannah McKnight and I identify as transgender but I prefer the term T-Girl. For years I kept a daily blog called Hannah’s Diary but after four years it was time for a change and I created a new website focusing on fashion, advice and activism.  Over the last few years I have gotten more involved with trans-activism, social awareness and creating a supportive environment for all transwomen. I live in Saint Paul, Minnesota so much of my blogging focuses on the Minneapolis and Saint Paul area especially when it comes to resources, support and hitting the town. I also contribute to Frock magazine and model for Glamour Boutique. I hope you enjoy my blog!  I would love to hear from you! Love, Hannah
