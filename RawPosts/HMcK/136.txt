The wind does pose other issues besides losing my hair.\u00a0 I used to have wavy, curly hair like in the picture and although I loved the look of it, one gust of wind or a strong breeze completely messed up my hair and I was constantly having to fix it and make myself presentable again.\u00a0 After spending an entire weekend outside at Pride this summer, I decided it was time to go back to my long, straight, hairstyle. Depending on the dress or the skirt you\u2019re wearing, the wind might give people a glimpse of yourself you didn\u2019t intend them to have.\u00a0 Using your hands to hold down your skirt so the wind doesn\u2019t blow it up does take some getting used to.\u00a0 If the wind is really crazy then you really have your hands full.\u00a0 I think those of us who have been out of the house know what I\u2019m talking about. If it\u2019s very windy, I suggest keeping your hands to your sides to hold your dress down.\u00a0 Simply holding it down in the front is not going to keep the back from flying up and it\u2019s awkward to hold a skirt down behind you.\u00a0 The only time this really happened was also at Pride this summer.\u00a0 I wore a really cute dress that had a billowing skirt.\u00a0 It was windy that day and as I walked to my car I was constantly brushing my hair out of my face and trying to keep my skirt from flying up.\u00a0 I was a hot mess that day.
