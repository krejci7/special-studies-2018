She knows what transgender is just not who it is. What I know is that she loves me and that will not change :):):)  It can be delicate for a while. Both of us just letting it digest. This can take overnight or it could take years (this would be a mutual denial) This is my greatest fear. The girl wants out and she wants to be acknowledged. To just go into a holding pattern would be worse then internalizing it.  Support groups? Books? Therapist? ( OK, I have one)  Any advice? -Valerie Coming out to anyone, especially your significant other is probably one of the hardest things we will ever do.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t easy and I\u2019m glad you did it.\u00a0 It\u2019s always better for us to come out as opposed to being caught.\u00a0 I get at least one email a week from a significant other of a crossdresser or t-girl who pour their hearts out because they caught their boyfriend, fiance or husband or discovered their wardrobe.\u00a0 Many times it\u2019s not about the clothes, it\u2019s about the lying and not being honest with them. I know it\u2019s not easy, but I urge you all to please, please tell your significant other about this side of you before get married or live with each other.\u00a0 I know it\u2019ll be hard, but you owe it to them. But I digress. When you come out to someone, especially a significant other, it\u2019s easy to let things get out of hand.\u00a0 For many of us we have kept this part of ourselves secret for so long that it\u2019s a relief to talk to someone about it.\u00a0 It\u2019s possible we\u2019ve never talked about this to anyone else and soon our experiences, desires and secrets just pour out.\u00a0 This can be very overwhelming.\u00a0 The person you came out to is still processing this information and when you add more to it, it can be a lot to take in.\u00a0 Take it slow. When it comes to what\u2019s next, well, that\u2019s up to you.\u00a0 What do you want to do?\u00a0 What do you currently do?\u00a0 Do you dress at all?\u00a0 With my wife I did not go from coming out to dressing completely in a couple days.\u00a0 It took time for both of us to adjust.\u00a0 It started with her seeing panties in my dresser and her getting used to that.\u00a0 Then sleeping in a nightgown and so on.\u00a0 It was about four years after I came out before I was in a dress, makeup and a wig.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t always make the right decisions during this time and I got lost in the pink fog a lot, but my wife is an incredible person and she was always honest and direct with me with what she was thinking, feeling as well as what she was and wasn\u2019t comfortable with. Don\u2019t be surprised if this is two steps forward and one step back for a while.\u00a0 Don\u2019t fight her if she asks you to not dress up for a few days\u2026or weeks or around her.\u00a0 If she sets limits or boundaries, respect and honor them.\u00a0 You mention you have a therapist, perhaps you may consider a couples session where the two of you attend to discuss this part of you.\u00a0 She may also need someone to talk to independent of you and I would recommend PFLAG, a wonderful organization that provides, among other things, support groups for our friends and families. Good luck! Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
