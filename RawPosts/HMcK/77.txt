I was fortunate to get a makeover by her when I visited her store and wanted to share my experience.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had a lot of makeovers over the last few years but I have to say I was blown away by Corrie and her techniques.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been using color correcting\u00a0 to cover up my beard line, but the foundation and concealing technique she used was amazing.  What I loved about the makeover was watching her work.\u00a0 Most of the makeovers I\u2019ve had I faced the artist and didn\u2019t see my face until my makeover was completed, but with Corrie I was in front of a mirror the entire time and was able to see her work.\u00a0 I was able to see my face transform into someone beautiful and it was amazing.   Corrie is set up to do makeovers not only in her store but also in a private room should you so wish.\u00a0 Corrie understands that many of us have a need for privacy and she is more than able to accommodate.   After the makeover, I did some shopping and purchased the concealer and eyeliner she used for my makeover.\u00a0 I also picked up some custom made lip gloss for my wife. I had an amazing afternoon and I cannot recommend Corrie and her store enough.\u00a0 I know you\u2019ll have an amazing time. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
