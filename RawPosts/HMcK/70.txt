We dined at Kincaid\u2019s in Saint Paul, a really beautiful restaurant with terrific service and food.\u00a0 There were a total of nine of us and there were a few girls who were out with the T-Girls for the first time so it\u2019s lovely to meet new friends. Some of us knew each other from previous outings, but for the most part everyone got to know each other for the first time yesterday.\u00a0 It really is amazing how so many of us have the same experiences and feelings and we are all connected through who we are.\u00a0 Within minutes we were all chatting as if we were lifelong friends about everything from makeup to family to books.   It has been a busy month for me so I was really looking for ward to getting ready and dolled up and having really yummy food.\u00a0 I had a chance to wear a new dress I bought back in January on another T-Girl outing and I loved how it looked.  Thank you to Kincaid\u2019s for impeccable hospitality, for delicious food, for always directing us to the ladies\u2019 room and for making us feel welcome.\u00a0 Thank you to everyone who came last night, see you soon!
