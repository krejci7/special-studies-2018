I like to keep my eyebrows well maintained.\u00a0 It drives me crazy when they look unruly as the stray hairs start to grow back.\u00a0 There\u2019s really no getting around it that if you do start to shape, thin and/or arch your brows that they will look more feminine.\u00a0 I get my brows threaded (google or youtube it), but you can also have them waxed.\u00a0 If you decide to have a professional groom your brows, tell them what you want.\u00a0 When I get my brows down, I ask the technician to clean them up, but I can also ask them to define them, shape them and thin them\u2026either by a little or by a lot.\u00a0 I would recommend visiting with a professional and telling them you\u2019d like a little more shape to them, but not to overdo it.\u00a0 They are professionals and trust me,\u00a0 you won\u2019t be the first man to ask for a little definition in your brows. However, the truth is that most men do not groom and trim their eyebrows, so it\u2019s quite likely yours will be noticed when in male mode\u2026but its not very likely that anyone will say anything.\u00a0 How often do you discuss someone\u2019s eyebrows with them? If you do not want to trim or arch them, you can also cover them up with a really good foundation and use an eyebrow pencil to define them. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
