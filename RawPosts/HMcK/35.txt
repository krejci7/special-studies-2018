For my recent photoshoot with Shannonlee, I wore mostly dresses with the exception of this outfit.  I really like wearing this skirt and top combination, but I am not sure how I look in it.  I almost think my shoulders are too wide.  But that’s okay, because I feel cute in it.   I have a hard time putting together outfits around a skirt, so I am happy when I see a mannequin displaying a cute skirt and top outfit to give me inspiration. Love, Hannah
