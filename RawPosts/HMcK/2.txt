Are you a football fan? Do you plan to wear a football themed outfit to watch the big game? I was wondering why there was so much more traffic this week!\u00a0  I am not a football fan, so I am not planning on watching the Super Bowl.\u00a0 But even though I am not a Vikings fan, I still wear purple on occasion.  I am proud that Minneapolis is getting a lot of attention at the moment, though.\u00a0 I think we have an amazing city for many reasons.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very progressive city that has a lot of resources and support for our community.\u00a0 In November Andrea Jenkins became the first out trans woman of color elected to public office in America.\u00a0 The University of Minnesota also recently curated an exhibit documenting the history of the transgender and gender non-conforming community.   If you\u2019re in town for the game I hope you enjoy our city and I promise you that it\u2019s not normally this cold. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Hannah McKnight"}
