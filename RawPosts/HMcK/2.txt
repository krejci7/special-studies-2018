Yes, I am older but I think I actually look younger in the second photo, mainly due to losing a significant amount of weight between the two pictures.\u00a0 My face has changed shape and has become narrower and more angular.\u00a0 I also tend to get dark circles around my eyes that I didn\u2019t get when I was younger. As one\u2019s face changes, a makeup routine will need to adapt as well.\u00a0 Over the last year or so I\u2019ve been getting a little frustrated with my makeup routine.\u00a0 No matter how much highlighter or concealer I was using, the darkness would start to show through after a couple hours.\u00a0 I had tried to contour my face to have a rounder shape to contrast the bonier structure my face had developed after losing weight. I decided to was time to schedule a makeup lesson with Corrie, the owner and incredibly talented artist of Midwest Makeup in the Uptown neighborhood in Minneapolis.\u00a0 I had a few goals I wanted to accomplish during our appointment. First of all, I wanted to streamline my makeup process.\u00a0 My routine consisted of color correcting by using red lipstick over my jawline to contrast the blueness that facial hair can create under foundation.\u00a0 It\u2019s effective\u2026but due to my dark hair I need several layers of foundation to counteract the blueness.\u00a0 Corrie had introduced me to Dermacolor Camouflage Creme beard cover.\u00a0 I was really pleased with how effective this worked.\u00a0 I only needed one layer of foundation to use over the beard cover and my jawline.  I also wanted to find new foundation besides the Dermablend (and others) that I normally use.\u00a0 Besides the Dermablend, I use liquid foundation, but Corrie introduced to cream foundation and corrector for under my eyes.   Cream foundation is used with a pallet and a pallet knife similar to how a painter would use paint\u2026which, if you think about it, is exactly what one is doing.\u00a0 I then used a brush to apply the foundation.\u00a0 I really liked the Groaftobin line of foundation and corrector that Corrie taught me how to use. I wanted to learn contouring to achieve a more oval shape to my face.\u00a0 It\u2019s widely thought that the \u201cideal\u201d facial shape is an oval and contouring is an effective way to achieve that.\u00a0 After watching a lot of makeup tutorial videos I thought I knew how to make this work for my face but I was never happy with the results.\u00a0 Corrie taught me how to contour MY face.\u00a0 My face is different than yours, and it\u2019s different than every face in a makeup video.\u00a0 What works for one face will not necessarily work for another face.\u00a0 Corrie matched my skin color to a few different shades and showed me how to which foundation shade to which parts of my face.\u00a0 She showed me how to blend and how blending foundation uses a different technique than blending highlighter. Another goal was upping my eyes hadow game.\u00a0 This was a lot simpler than I was making it, and I was really happy to learn some new techniques using different colors.   Finally, I wanted to find new brushes to use for foundation, blending and for my lipstick.\u00a0 No matter how careful I am, I can never achieve a nice smooth defining lip line.\u00a0 Corrie showed me which brush she uses for lipstick and taught me some helpful tricks. An hour and half later, I was more energized and more excited and confident about my makeup routine that I have been in years.\u00a0 During the appointment Corrie would work on half of my face and I would mirror her technique on the other side of my face.\u00a0 She was patient, supportive and talented.\u00a0 I really feel I know what works for my \u201cnew\u201d face, not anyone else\u2019s.\u00a0\u00a0 Makeup is one of the most challenging, satisfying things one can learn.\u00a0 It\u2019s a humbling, empowering skill.\u00a0 There are times where I feel amazing and times I feel very male.\u00a0 Although I used the same technique and products for years, I almost always looked different each time I did my face.\u00a0 It\u2019s not an easy thing to learn, and it\u2019s absolutely worth investing time and money to learn techniques and which products to learn.
