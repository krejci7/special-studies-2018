Last week I had no fear of putting on a new dress and walking down the street, tomorrow night I will be doing the same.\u00a0 I do this without (much) fear, but it doesn\u2019t take much to realize how lucky we are.\u00a0 What we have is owed to the generations of transpeople who came before us.\u00a0 Years from today, generations will acknowledge the efforts we\u2019re making now.\u00a0 But the fight for tolerance is a slow one, and it begins somewhere. The fight for these rights is the story of Cleo. You can watch the trailer here.
