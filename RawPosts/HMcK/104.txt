I think this is so important, especially right now.  We live in a society accepts us and hates us more than ever.  There are laws against us, there are people who don’t accept us, people who don’t even try to understand us. It all gets very depressing. There are many resources for us.  Here’s a list for those of us who live here in Minnesota, but there are many places to get help, to find a friend, to have someone to talk to. Love, Hannah
