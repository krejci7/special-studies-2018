I remember the very first MN T-Girl meeting at Cafe Southside in Minneapolis.\u00a0 I arrived a little early and wondered if anyone would show up.\u00a0 But a few people did, and now, 4 years and a whole lot of eyeliner later, the group is still going strong with close to 200 members.\u00a0 When I started the group, I had a goal of helping other t-girls find the courage to go out, have fun, make friends and experience life outside of their living room.\u00a0 I also wanted to help us become visible to the rest of the world.\u00a0 To show people that we are real and are more than how we are portrayed in movies. I\u2019d like to think that these goals are being accomplished.\u00a0 At almost every monthly event, there is usually at least one t-girl out for the first time.\u00a0 Almost all events are out in public, whether at the mall, in a restaurant or museum.\u00a0 I am also seeing increased tolerance, acceptance and love from the real world.\u00a0 Whether it is the group being invited for a private shopping event, a play or simply someone telling me that they love my dress. I like looking back at how things have evolved, and I also like to celebrate!\u00a0 Yesterday was the monthly MN T-Girls outing and it was truly special.\u00a0 Yesterday\u2019s event was actually comprised of three separate moments.\u00a0 The first was an amazing combination of our history and of our future.\u00a0 The University of Minnesota recently unveiled an exhibit documenting the history of the transgender and non-gender conforming community with a special emphasis on Minnesota\u2019s role and community.\u00a0 The exhibit, titled \u2018In Their Own Words\u2019: The Tretter Transgender Oral History Project\u00a0 is an amazing collection of literature, newspaper articles, photographs and interviews.\u00a0 I was excited to see the exhibit and thought it\u2019d be interesting and important for the MN T-Girls to visit.\u00a0 I think history is so important.\u00a0 I have the freedom to walk through Target in heels but I can\u2019t forget those activists who fought for this freedom. Typically, the museum is not open on the weekends, but thanks to the U of M\u2019s kindness, they opened for our group for a special weekend showing.\u00a0 I cannot thank the U of M enough for their flexibility.\u00a0 What made the visit extra-extra-extra special was our tour guide was Andrea Jenkins, the curator of the exhibit and the first out transgender person of color elected to public office in the United States!\u00a0 Jenkins will represent Ward 8 on the Minneapolis City Council next year.  \u00a0 I learned a lot about our history, such as when the term \u2018transgender\u2019 was first used, how different ethnic groups have had multiple genders for a very long time, and how the U of M was the second university in the United States to perform a gender reaffirmation surgery.\u00a0 It was an amazing exhibit and I am still stunned by the courage of those who came before us.  Again, special thanks to Ms. Jenkins and the U of M! We had dinner reservations but there was a little time to kill before then.\u00a0 A small group of us went to Midwest Makeup Supply in Minneapolis to do a little shopping.\u00a0 The MN T-Girls had a private makeup event there earlier in the year and it\u2019s always fun to visit.  After the exhibit and shopping it was time to eat!\u00a0 We had a wonderful meal at PUBLIC kitchen + bar in Saint Paul.\u00a0 We had dined there two years ago and like last time, we had delicious food and wonderful service.\u00a0 I can\u2019t wait to go back! It was a fun day and I cannot thank Andrea, the U of M, Public and Midwest Makeup enough for helping make the day special.\u00a0 I also want to thank every member of the MN T-Girls for helping the group grow and making the group what it is.  Onto the next four years! Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
