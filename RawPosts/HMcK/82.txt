I identify as a \u201csissy\u201d meaning I tend to prefer frilly, innocent outfits (think baby dolls and Alice in wonderland) \u2026 dressing is arousing for me \u2026 and I am not interested in really being female in public. Here is where I could use some advice. I have three outfits but I always feel intimidated to put them on (they are a bit over the top in terms of frills and lace so not really public appropriate). And when I do, I put them on and don\u2019t really know what to do with myself. I\u2019ll curtsy a few times in the mirror and then put everything away.\u00a0 I think about dressing a lot but I don\u2019t understand why I only allow myself a few minutes to feel pretty and then pack \u201cAshleigh\u201d away. Do you have any advice as to why I might feel this way or ways to explore my dressing in more fulfilling ways?  Thanks!  Ashleigh I like to think that the term \u2018transgender\u2019 covers a lot of different forms of gender identity.\u00a0 Someone explained to me that the term covers any form of identification that is outside of the normal cultural norms that are associated with the gender that is assigned to someone at birth.\u00a0 So, by that definition I believe transgender can cover everything from drag to transitioning. As a lifelong crossdresser/t-girl, the world of sissy dressing is not new to me, although it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve ever explored.\u00a0 However, I think part of us feel that there is a bit of a shift in personality as we go from one gender to another.\u00a0 I certainly don\u2019t feel that there is a lot of overlap in both of my lives/genders.\u00a0 As I get ready and do my makeup, I definitely feel myself\u2026crossing over.\u00a0 It\u2019s a strange feeling and not easy to explain, but I think many of us can relate. I used to feel a bit of a blend between both sides of me, regardless of which gender I am presenting as.\u00a0 But over the last few years, I feel the separation of my two sides are more defined than ever.\u00a0 As Hannah, I almost completely withdraw from my male life.\u00a0 I don\u2019t do the things I would normally do as a male.\u00a0 The same is true when I am in male mode.\u00a0 When I am out running errands, I won\u2019t drop by Sephora for eyeliner.\u00a0 I\u2019ll wait until Hannah is out.\u00a0 It feels a little odd to me to do things as one gender for the other. I think you need to let yourself slip into your other self.\u00a0 You need to mentally shift into your other gender.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy to feel a little self-conscience as you dress and when you first see yourself in the mirror.\u00a0 But let go of your male side and enjoy you are. You may also consider exploring your female side in other ways.\u00a0 You obviously love frilly dresses, but perhaps considering wearing clothes that are less \u201cdress up\u201d and more casual.\u00a0 I think for some (not all) that dress up as a sissy do it as a fetish or a sexual thrill and for many of us, that\u2019s where our gender exploration began.\u00a0 It\u2019s certainly where I began.\u00a0 But I evolved, I tried other clothes that were less fetish-y and more appropriate for a night out or an afternoon at the mall.\u00a0 Perhaps if you dressed in a way that would allow you to blend in, you may feel more comfortable leaving the house. The clothes you wear can have a direct impact on how you feel.\u00a0 I have a beautiful floor length ballgown that I absolutely love but I feel a little silly when I where it my living room.\u00a0\u00a0 I feel much more comfortable in a casual dress.\u00a0 And killer heels. I hope that helps! Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
