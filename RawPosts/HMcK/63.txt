Sometimes I am amazed at our progress.  Sometimes I am amazed at the progress of the rest of the world.  Never did I think we’d live in an age where there were greeting cards designed to celebrate someone’s transition but that is exactly what Hallmark is doing.   Hallmark put out a line of cards in 2015 that went largely unnoticed until recently.  I really recommend reading this article from the Kansas City Star. Thanks to Jennifer for forwarding this article to me! Love, Hannah
