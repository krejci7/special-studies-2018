But the truth is, the weight may have been lifted from our shoulders, but the weight is still there.\u00a0 We feel better, but the person we confide in carries that weight now.\u00a0 We confide in others at the hope and trust that they will not tell others, but any secret can be a burden to someone.\u00a0 Especially something like this.\u00a0 The people we confide in will likely have questions, they may need someone to talk to about our reveal.\u00a0 I know when I came out to my wife she often wished she had someone she could talk to about me.\u00a0 Yes, I felt better when I came out, but she carried that weight. Not only can the weight be transferred, it can often be shared.\u00a0 If I am nervous about going out, whether is because of being seen by someone I don\u2019t want to be seen by or possibly being hurt by someone else, those fears are now the fears of the person we confide in. I write this because I want us to acknowledge the burden we can put on a person when we come out to them.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy to overwhelm someone with everything we have been thinking, feeling and even wearing for years.\u00a0 If we have never spoken to someone about this, many emotions can come pouring out, like a dam breaking.\u00a0 We have been discovering, and often times creating who we are for many years.\u00a0 We have had a long time to come to terms with who we are.\u00a0 When we come out to someone, it hits them all at once. I don\u2019t know if there is a right way to come out to someone.\u00a0 I know there are plenty of wrong ways.\u00a0 I feel it\u2019s wrong to wait to come out to someone until after you\u2019re married.\u00a0 Many of us have tried or hoped this part of us would go away after we got married, but THIS NEVER GOES AWAY.\u00a0 We are who we are and there\u2019s nothing wrong with who we are.\u00a0 But we need to be honest with ourselves and we need to be honest with our future spouses. Before you come out to someone, I would recommend talking to someone who will understand, such as a gender therapist or joining a transgender support group.\u00a0 Pflag is a wonderful place to start.\u00a0 I would also recommend being prepared to offer some resources to the person you come out.\u00a0 Again, Pflag is an excellent resource. I wish I knew how to tell you how to come out to someone.\u00a0 I have come out to a few people in my life and some have gone well, and some have not.\u00a0 I realized that you cannot come out to everyone the same way.\u00a0 I know we want to be accepted, I know we want to be understood. I know we want to be loved. Please, be gentle. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
