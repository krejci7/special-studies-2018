My makeup looked good.\u00a0 My mascara made my eyelashes so long that they cast a shadow on my face.\u00a0 My lipstick matched my outfit.\u00a0 Whatever was going to happen, I was going to face it by looking fabulous.\u00a0 I was going to meet up with a friend for dinner and I had some time to kill so I went to the mall.\u00a0 I popped into a few stores and then as I rounded a corner, I saw her. I saw my mom. I came out to my mom a few years ago, when I still identified as a crossdresser. \u00a0 I still identify as a crossdresser but I feel transgender is more appropriate.\u00a0 It was a surprise to her and although my mom is a wonderful person and supportive of the GLBTQ community, she wasn\u2019t prepared for this revelation and it didn\u2019t go as well as I had hoped.\u00a0 But I think I could have explained myself better.\u00a0 I think had I explained what it meant for me to identify as trans as opposed to me wearing dresses and heels it might have gone differently.\u00a0 I think when I started to identify as transgender instead of a crossdresser I went from \u201cthis is what I like to do\u201d to \u201cthis is who I am\u201d. I was excited for her to meet Hannah.\u00a0 I wanted\u00a0 very much to go shopping with my mom, to meet for coffee.\u00a0 To be a daughter, even if only for an afternoon.\u00a0 But it wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u00a0 She was glad I was honest with her but wasn\u2019t ready to meet Hannah. Over the next few months, we had a few more conversations but I didn\u2019t feel they were going anywhere.\u00a0 I soon gave up on the hope of her meeting Hannah.\u00a0 It would still hurt from time to time, however.\u00a0 I knew my mom loved and accepted me, but I couldn\u2019t help feeling sad that there was this part of my life, another half of my life, that she didn\u2019t want to know. \u00a0 I could have pressed, but I respected her feelings. Lately it has been on my mind, though.\u00a0 I wondered if enough time had passed for me to broach the subject again.\u00a0 When I considered this, most of the time I decided to drop it.\u00a0 When I didn\u2019t decide to drop it, I wondered how to do it, and ended up dropping it anyway.\u00a0 But yesterday my mom faced me in the most literal way possible: by running into me at the mall.\u00a0 Because of course I was at the mall. As we walked towards each other, I didn\u2019t have that sense of panic.\u00a0 It was more like\u2026what should I do here?\u00a0 I remembered my mom saying she didn\u2019t want to meet me, but it felt wrong to just pass by her and not say anything.\u00a0 But I also felt like this was my chance.\u00a0 It was meant to be. After the initial shock, we got to chatting.\u00a0 Small talk, how the week went, what was coming up later on in the month, my sisters, weekend plans.\u00a0 I am sure running into Hannah was the last thing she expected to happen on her Saturday trip to JCPenney\u2019s but my mom bounced back well and was comfortable, chatty, friendly and just\u2026normal.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t feel weird or tense. We ended up walking around the store and talking for about 20 minutes until she was off on her next errand.\u00a0 In the parking lot I told her that I knew she didn\u2019t want to meet me and that I was sorry it happened.\u00a0 I am not sorry for who I am, but I respected her decision to not meet me.\u00a0 I told her that this afternoon was something I had dreamed of for a very long time.\u00a0 I let her know if she ever wanted to go shopping or have a coffee that I would love to meet up with her. I was surprised at how emotional I was when I told her this. We said our goodbyes, she told me she loved me (as she always does when I see her) and she hugged me.\u00a0 Do you know how long I\u2019ve wanted her to hug Hannah? I walked back to the mall and immediately texted my wife.\u00a0 After I told her what happened, we exchanged this:  My evening went as planned and later my wife called my mom just to check in with her now that she met me.\u00a0 My mom was supportive and talkative, had some questions for my wife and was very encouraging.\u00a0 I suppose ten years ago I never thought I would have had a day like yesterday\u2026having a wife who is supportive, having the confidence to go out, having the courage to tell my mom and for my wife and my mom to chat about my gender identity on the phone. I never really thought what occurred yesterday would ever happen and who knows if she\u2019ll ever see me again.\u00a0 Yesterday life became a whole new world for myself and for my mom.\u00a0 It was full of new.\u00a0 I mean, how often does your mom meet you for the first time?
