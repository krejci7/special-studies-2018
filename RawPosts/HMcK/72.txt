I am proud to feature her in T-Girl Spotlight. Nicole\u2019s Story Hi. \u00a0I am Nicole Spencer. I identify as transgender. I have known Hannah for a number of years and have attended many of her MN T-Girls activities/events going back to the first one in late 2013. \u00a0I thank her for asking me to be part of her T-girl Spotlight series.   I am divorced and have two adult children, 24 and 27, both of whom know about Nicole. Both kids prefer not to see me as Nicole, but accept that I am who I am. \u00a0As far as I know, my ex-wife still knows nothing about Nicole.      I started crossdressing at approximately age 10, although I do remember \u2018playing house\u2019 earlier than that and occasionally was a female then too. I have always loved high heels. They are my weakness. \u00a0Heels are where I started, then worked my way upward as i dressed more adding nylons, then a dress or top/skirt, then the lingerie under the dress, as time moved forward. Finally as I aged even more, I added a wig and makeup. To this day, I most often buy shoes first, then find an outfit to match.  I was in \u201cthe closet\u201d for way too long. I didn\u2019t go out in public until Spring, 2009, and that was just to another t-girl\u2019s house for some makeup lessons. \u00a0I finally went to a public venue, the Town House Bar in St. Paul, MN, for the first time in July, 2009, at age 46. Since my kids didn\u2019t yet know, going out was both rare and at random times. Things have changed since talking to my kids about my Nicole side. I now go out at least once a week, sometimes two or three times a week. I have Hannah to thank in part for that. Having participated in numerous MN T-Girls gatherings, it\u2019s been a group that has helped me gain confidence and be comfortable with who I am. \u00a0It\u2019s helped me \u201cown it.\u201d \u00a0I gain more and more confidence and become more comfortable each and every time I go out. \u00a0I have also gained friends and supporters from this group.   Online social media has also helped me spread my wings. I have gained a number of friends by socializing online. \u00a0I am on Facebook. Thanks to the available communication tools and thanks to people who travel for whatever reason, I have had the chance to meet a number of people in person, starting with a business traveler who happens to be a t-girl. After meeting her locally a few times, I decided that it was time to take to the road. Yes, Nicole travels. Locally, I have been all over the Twin Cities and it\u2019s suburbs. \u00a0Getting out of Minnesota, I have taken girl trips to Chicago and Detroit. I have met some fantastic people in both of those cities whom I can now say are friends. I am comfortable in both cities.  One last thing. \u00a0Whether you\u2019re new to this lifestyle or have been living it for years, if we happen to cross paths, please say hello. \u00a0And if you live in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area or happen to be here as a visitor, please check to see if Hannah is hosting an event. \u00a0They are terrific opportunities to get out and be yourself.  Hugs,  Nicole Spencer", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
