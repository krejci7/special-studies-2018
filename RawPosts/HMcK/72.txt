The $17,000 project will change signs and make security upgrades, such as new locks, at 62 gender-neutral restrooms at 44 city facilities, including department offices, fire and police stations, Public Works facilities and city-owned parking ramps over the next few weeks. The bathrooms will be available for anyone to use, and separate men\u2019s and women\u2019s restrooms will continue to exist. \u201cWe see this as part of providing better service overall to members of the public as well as to our own city staff,\u201d said Council Member Elizabeth Glidden, who pushed for the establishment of the city\u2019s new Transgender Equity Council. \u201cWe want to make sure people are comfortable going into restrooms.\u201d More here!
