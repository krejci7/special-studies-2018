The exhibit, titled \u201cIn Their Own Words\u2019: The Tretter Transgender Oral History Project,\u201d is on display at the Elmer L. Andersen Library. A celebration was held for the exhibit, which included an announcement about the project\u2019s future. \u201cI just want to highlight why it is so important that we tell our narratives at this time while we are still alive,\u201d said Andrea Jenkins, oral historian of the transgender oral history project. \u201cBecause in 2017, 23 transgendered people \u2026 primarily transgendered women of color [have] been murdered.\u201d This sounds like a really amazing exhibit.\u00a0 I definitely plan on going.\u00a0 Here are the details of the exhibit: The exhibition is open October 13, 2017 through January 31, 2018 Elmer L. Andersen Library Atrium Gallery Exhibit hours: Monday, Tuesday, & Friday | 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Wednesday & Thursday | 8:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. More information here!
