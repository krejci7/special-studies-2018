Have you come to a point where you\u2019ve committed to going out as Hannah and then you get bummed or stressed because of having made a commitment to be Hannah? It\u2019s my firm belief that one is always a crossdresser.\u00a0 We do what we do because it is who we are.\u00a0 No matter how many times we purge, or promise ourselves\u2026or others that we will never do it again, we almost always do.\u00a0 Because of this, I think that crossdressing will always be exciting and fun to us.\u00a0 It\u2019s who we are, but there\u2019s a reason we keep coming back to this. But I understand your question.\u00a0 I always want to feel that going out as Hannah is special and fun.\u00a0 One way I help make that happen is by really limiting how often I dress and go out.\u00a0 I go out about twice a month which is often enough to satisfy me, but not enough to take away the fun of it.\u00a0 Limiting the times I dress and go out helps keeps my wife from feeling overwhelmed by who I am, too.\u00a0 My wife is wonderful and accepting of my femme side, but a large contributor to her acceptance is that I don\u2019t overwhelm her with it and I\u2019ve found a good balance with both sides of who I am.
