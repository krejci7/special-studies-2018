There are times this father of a daughter and loving husband feels feminine. Very, very feminine. I like to dress up. I like being a woman I have always felt this. I have always felt that I should be not a masculine being but the other end. I cannot explain it any better then that. When the phase shifts I am again man. I put away the dresses. The shoes (hardest part. I LOVE my shoes). I really don’t know. Am I a t-girl? A wannabe? A pretender?  The last thing I want is to diminish the bravery that you and other have shown in show in the world who you are. Are there others like me? Caught between one life or another?  Who am I? I think most of go back and forth between how we identify ourselves.  Sometimes these identities can change throughout the day, or even longer.  Four years ago I identified as a crossdresser; these days it is transgender, but I prefer t-girl.  The term transgender does cover a lot of different identities, and labels, if you will. My suggestion is to stop stressing about how you identify.  It’s okay if it changes.  It probably will, however, the term transgender is a bit of a catch all and likely covers everything we all feel we are. It’s also normal for many of us to shift back and forth between what we feel like doing.  Sometimes I feel like reading, sometimes I feel like doing yardwork, sometimes I feel like getting a makeover.  You don’t have to pick one thing to do, to wear, or to be. And yes, there are others like you.  There are so many like you. As for myself, I fully embrace having two lives, having two genders.  Sometimes they blend together but why should I pick one?  Some of us do, but I like having options. Love, Hannah
