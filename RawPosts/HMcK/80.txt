The bill, like one introduced in the Minnesota Senate on Friday, amends the Minnesota Human Rights Act, the nation\u2019s first nondiscrimination law barring discrimination based on gender identity. House committee hearing set for anti-transgender bill From thecolu.mn HF3396 will get a hearing in the Minnesota House Civil Law and Data Practices Committee on Thursday, March 31. The committee meeting starts at 8:15am in room 10 of the State Office Building. HF3396 is a bill that targets Minnesota\u2019s longstanding ban on discrimination based on gender identity, enacted in 1993. It would block gender-inclusive policies at school districts and local municipalities and force transgender people to use a restroom that does not correspond to their gender \u2014 putting many transgender people at risk for discrimination and violence, according to research at UCLA\u2019s Williams Institute. Every once in a while, someone sends me an email where the writer says that Republican\u2019s don\u2019t hate or discriminate against transpeople and I think about those emails when I read articles like this.\u00a0 I wonder why 44 people, Republicans or otherwise, would care if a private business offered a gender-neutral restroom.\u00a0 I also wonder why anyone could vote for a law that would reverse a ban on discrimination. I hate reading news like this. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
