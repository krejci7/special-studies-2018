Last night I had the honor and pleasure of meeting Corrie, a superstar in the Twin Cities trans community.  I’ve been hearing about Corrie and her business Midwest Makeup for a few years now and I am kicking myself for not meeting her sooner.  Midwest Makeup not only sells amazing makeup I’ve never heard of before (they custom make lipstick!), but she is absolutely the most talented makeup artist I’ve ever met. Corrie also specializes in male to female transformation services and has a website called Femme Makeovers where she does makeovers and gives lessons for those who are looking for an absolutely incredible life and gender changing experience. Corrie was the host of the MN T-Girls March event last night where she kindly invited our group to her shop for an after hours event where she demonstrated different techniques such as beard covering, contouring, eyelash application and many other skills.     I’ve been using a color correcting technique for beard cover for a few years now and it works rather well, but I was amazed at a product she demonstrated  called Camouflage Creme by Kryolan.  I highly recommend it for those of us who have trouble covering facial hair.   After the demonstrations were over, Corrie and her associates Hexa and Ben helped the girls shop for makeup and provide one on one tutorials.  I love watching amazingly talented makeup artists work their magic.   It was a wonderful, beautiful evening.  Every time I talk to a makeup artist I realize how much more there is to learn and how many possibilities makeup has. Thank you Corrie, Hexa and Ben for a truly magical evening.  Love, Hannah
