But what we do takes time.\u00a0 It takes patience.\u00a0 It takes practice.\u00a0 We often need a mentor.\u00a0 Creating ourselves and being comfortable with who we are can take a lot of effort.\u00a0 The picture of me in the white dress was taken about six years ago.\u00a0 I remember how happy it made me when it was taken, but as time passed, I realized how far I had come whenever I looked at the early photos. If you\u2019ve spent even just ten seconds on this blog, you\u2019ll see that I obviously love having my photograph taken.\u00a0 I was fortunate enough to partner with an amazing photographer, Shannonlee, a few years ago and she is so much fun to work with.\u00a0 In addition to working with such a fun and talented artist, the photos are a reminder of how far I\u2019ve come\u2026as a result of hard work, patience, exercise and building confidence and how it can pay off.\u00a0 To me, the photos are less about how I look, but more of a reminder of how I feel about myself.\u00a0 I feel happy, confident and assured.\u00a0 I have come a long way from needing validation in the early days.\u00a0 The girl in white dress looks insecure, guarded and although she\u2019s smiling, she\u2019s unsure of herself.\u00a0 She has the heels, but missing confidence. Confidence is everything.\u00a0 Whether you are a t-girl or not, it\u2019s confidence that gets us through the day, helps keeps our head held high as we strut through the mall or make eye contact with those who stare at us.\u00a0 Confidence helps us ask the makeup artist to recommend a foundation for our skin tone, confidence helps us ask the sales clerk if they have that cute red pump in a size 12 in the backroom. I recently had a photoshoot with Shannonlee and I am thrilled to post the first of the pictures.\u00a0 These photos are of me in a dress I purchased earlier this summer from Long Tall Sally.\u00a0 It\u2019s a little short and the slit makes it even more risque, but I don\u2019t spend two hours a week on the Stairmaster to cover up my legs.\u00a0  I hope you like these photos!\u00a0 I\u2019ll post more throughout the week.
