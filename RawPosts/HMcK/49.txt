This makes my day, obviously.\u00a0 Everyone loves a compliment and I am flattered by not only the kind words but also touched by the fact she went out of their way to say so. I started to wonder if this was a common exchange, though.\u00a0 Do women normally compliment complete strangers on their outfit?\u00a0 I started to listen to conversations at the store, the checkout lane\u2026anywhere I could to see if women offered compliments out of the blue to other women.\u00a0 I would hear the occasional \u201cI love your blouse\u201d or \u201ccute haircut\u201d, but these exchanges were not very common. Now, I am not saying that my sense of fashion is better than anyone else.\u00a0 That\u2019s not the point.\u00a0 I do not think I receive, or deserve, compliments any more often than anyone else. I started to wonder if \u201cI love your dress\u201d was\u2026well, if it was code in a way.\u00a0 If it\u2019s a way of saying \u201cI support the transcommunity\u201d and \u201cYou are welcome here\u201d.\u00a0 The more I hear this, the more certain I am correct.\u00a0 I believe that in the current climate where the transgender community is more out than ever, more politicized, more scrutinized and more visible than ever, that this is a way of saying they are an ally. I hope I\u2019m right.\u00a0 I would rather have someone identify themselves as an ally rather than complimenting me on my outfit. Of course, they can do both.\u00a0  Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
