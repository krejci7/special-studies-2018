For the most part, I have had only positive, or at least unremarkable interactions out in the real world.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been going out for more than five years now and I almost forget that I am doing something that I used to be terrified in doing.\u00a0 It\u2019s always fun to go out, but it\u2019s normal these days.\u00a0 I\u2019ve gone from \u201cI\u2019m going out into the real world and I better have my guard up\u201d to \u201cI\u2019m going out into the real world and I need a coffee.\u201d That\u2019s good, right?\u00a0 That being said, my guard is always up, it needs to be, but having my guard up is second nature and I don\u2019t even think about it.\u00a0 It\u2019s just\u2026always up.\u00a0 I\u2019m always breathing, my guard is always up. I\u2019ve said before that what someone thinks of you is none of your business.\u00a0 And it\u2019s true, I don\u2019t want to know what you think of me, unless of course you think my lipstick is cute, you like my dress or you\u2019re complimenting me on my ability to walk in stilettos.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think anyone minds when someone says something nice about us, and I think for the most part people are generally kind and likely won\u2019t say anything negative to you.\u00a0 But the world is filled with jerks who feel it\u2019s their right, maybe their obligation, to tell you what\u2019s on their mind and to harass you.\u00a0 I know that people at the mall don\u2019t care what I think, so why do they suppose I care about what they think?\u00a0 Guess what?\u00a0 I don\u2019t. Although for the most part my adventures have been wonderful, I still get second glances and stares.\u00a0 And that\u2019s okay, I look amazing and I don\u2019t mind.\u00a0 You look amazing, too, by the way.\u00a0 I don\u2019t spend any time trying to figure out why someone is staring, but I am self-aware enough to know I am well over six feet tall in heels and I am likely wearing a \u201clook-at-this-fabulous-dress\u201d dress so I am not surprised by the looks.\u00a0 I am also a t-girl and, let\u2019s face it, not everyone has seen a transperson before out in the real world so it\u2019s not unrealistic someone sees me and is processing it for a moment. And this is okay. \u00a0 I knew I was ready to go out into the real world once I accepted the fact that people would probably always react this way.\u00a0 Being prepared for the worst made the positive, even the mundane experiences, even better. But people are people and some think that their opinion and perspective needs to be heard.\u00a0 I know that there are many people, for many reasons, whether politically or religiously or whatever, think that transpeople are\u2026well, not okay.\u00a0 We\u2019re unnatural, heathens, perverts, confused, or not part of God\u2019s plan.\u00a0 I understand that others will have this perspective and belief system, but I am not on this planet to make anyone but myself happy.\u00a0 I am not living my life to make others comfortable and neither are you.\u00a0 Well, maybe you are, I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Are you? I have no illusions about myself or how others see me.\u00a0 I fully accept that others \u201cknow\u201d I am trans.\u00a0 And with that, I also fully accept that others will think of me as a man in a dress, a guy playing dress up or something derogatory.\u00a0 Some members of the transcommunity embrace the term \u201ctranny\u201d, but I think it\u2019s offensive.\u00a0 Regardless, most people don\u2019t care about me and what I\u2019m wearing and they are distracted and engaged in their own life, or, more likely, staring at their phone.\u00a0 Some people do want to share their opinion and for the most part, it\u2019s overwhelmingly positive.\u00a0 Some will compliment my outfit whether it\u2019s because they sincerely like it, or because it\u2019s another way of saying \u201cI support the transcommunity\u201d and will go out of my way to make me feel welcome. But the point is that there will always be those that just don\u2019t like us.\u00a0 If you go out at all, whether once a year or once a week or living full-time, the odds are pretty good someone will say something that will not be very nice.\u00a0 How you react to it is one thing, but being prepared and accepting that you\u2019ll likely have that experience does make it easier to leave the living room.\u00a0 Last year at the mall I was having a nice afternoon shopping (of course) and a woman walked across the hall and intentionally bumped into me and loudly said \u201coh, excuse me, SIR\u201d.\u00a0 At first I was confused.\u00a0 I was wearing a cute white dress with a floral patterns, matching accessories, nude heels, my favorite lipstick and carrying a purse.\u00a0 It took me a moment to remember that not everyone will respond to me as the gender as I am presenting as.\u00a0 Once that moment of confusion passed, I realized what had happened.\u00a0 Although I will never know why she did this, it was pretty clear she wanted to make me feel uncomfortable, stupid or embarrassed.\u00a0 Perhaps she felt that I needed to know that I wasn\u2019t \u201cfooling\u201d her.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what she thought of me.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t ask.\u00a0\u00a0 I didn\u2019t care.\u00a0 Still don\u2019t. So, what happened next?\u00a0 Well, nothing, to be honest.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t worth thinking about or speculating about.\u00a0 Rude people are not worth your time or energy.\u00a0 Don\u2019t let them steal your sparkle.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t ruin my day or bother me or hurt my feelings in the slightest.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t feel stupid, I didn\u2019t feel embarrassed, I didn\u2019t feel ugly or male.\u00a0 Whatever she wanted to accomplish, she failed miserably.\u00a0 I went on to have a fabulous afternoon and evening, found two really cute dresses and had a fun, thirty minute conversation about politics with a grandmother, her daughter and her granddaughter from Missouri. You\u2019ll have good days, bad days and days that are unremarkable.\u00a0 You\u2019ll have days where you\u2019ll find the perfect matching heels for the dress you bought two years ago but have never worn.\u00a0 You\u2019ll have days where you\u2019ll have lipstick on your teeth and run your stockings.\u00a0 You\u2019ll have days where you stumble a little in your stilettos and lose an earring.\u00a0 You\u2019ll have days where someone will call you \u2018sir\u2019 and smirk.\u00a0 You\u2019ll have days where a grandmother from St. Louis will call you the sweetest thing and waiters will call you \u2018ma\u2019am\u2019.\u00a0 Mama said there would be days like this, and she was right.
