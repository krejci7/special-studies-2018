The new rules will require officers to address transgender people using their preferred names and pronouns.  The Minneapolis Police Department has issued new guidelines on the treatment of transgender and gender nonconforming people, essentially restricting officers from singling out suspects based on their sexual orientation. Police Chief Janeé Harteau and Mayor Betsy Hodges announced the new rules at an afternoon news conference at City Hall on Wednesday. The policy change builds on the department’s mission of “learning and growing and understanding the people we serve,” Harteau told reporters at an afternoon news conference. “We need to be able to interact with them properly,” she said. The new rules compel officers to address transgender people using their preferred names and pronouns, while frisks and pat-downs will be conducted by “an officer of the gender requested by the suspect.” Source
