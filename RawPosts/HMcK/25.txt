We work to raise awareness about gender nonconformity in children and young people amongst professionals and the general public. We campaign for the recognition of gender dysphoria in young people and lobby for improvements in professional services. The Beaumont Society\u00a0 The Beaumont Society\u00a0was founded in 1966 as a self-help and social organisation for transgender people. We are still here, over fifty years later, in a very different social climate, with a broader membership but with the same aims. We became a charity in 2010 to enable us to meet those aims more effectively. Transfigurations Transfigurations is a transgender support group based in the South West of the UK.\u00a0 It was set up to help all trans people (transsexual, transvestite, intersex, genderqueer, trans youth etc.) come to terms with their gender identity and provide a safe meeting place whilst they explore their feelings.\u00a0  Stonewall We\u2019re here to let all lesbian, gay, bi and trans people, here and abroad, know they\u2019re not alone.\u00a0 We believe we\u2019re stronger united, so we partner with organisations that help us create real change for the better. We have laid deep foundations across Britain \u2013 in some of our greatest institutions \u2013 so our communities can continue to find ways to flourish, and individuals can reach their full potential. We\u2019re here to support those who can\u2019t yet be themselves. I am certain there are thousands of trans people in the U.K., but I don\u2019t know anyone personally.\u00a0 \u00a0 You may want to create a profile on The Gender Society, a UK based transgender forum and start there. If you are looking to meet others like us, or if the above groups aren\u2019t quite what you\u2019re looking for, you may want to consider starting your own group.\u00a0 That was the reason I started the MN T-Girls.\u00a0\u00a0 There are many transgender support groups in Minnesota, however I wanted to find a group that emphasized the social aspect of who we are.\u00a0 I wanted to make friends and go shopping and out to dinner but I didn\u2019t know of a group like that\u2026so I started one. I wanted to make some friends to go shopping with and to have a coffee with once in a while. \u00a0 As Hannah, I am very social.\u00a0 I like to do things with other people, I like to talk and socialize so I decided to make some friends. I had started attending a local crossdresser support group and I met a lot of really wonderful people but I didn\u2019t really identify with them.\u00a0 Most of the group were those who had transitioned or who were about to.\u00a0 It was a terrific support group for those who needed that support more than anything else.\u00a0 Me, I just wanted to make a friend to hit the mall with. Creating, organizing and maintaining a group like this is a challenge and can be frustrating at times.\u00a0 But it is also very rewarding and fun.\u00a0 it takes a lot of patience and professionalism and dedication.\u00a0 It takes commitment.\u00a0 It is a lot of hard work.\u00a0 It takes a lot of my time.\u00a0 However, through the group I\u2019ve been able to do many amazing things and I am constantly looking for new adventures for us.
