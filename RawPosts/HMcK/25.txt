From the Minnesota Daily: The University of Minnesota unveiled an exhibit documenting the history of the transgender and gender non-conforming community on Thursday. The exhibit, titled “In Their Own Words’: The Tretter Transgender Oral History Project,” is on display at the Elmer L. Andersen Library. A celebration was held for the exhibit, which included an announcement about the project’s future. “I just want to highlight why it is so important that we tell our narratives at this time while we are still alive,” said Andrea Jenkins, oral historian of the transgender oral history project. “Because in 2017, 23 transgendered people … primarily transgendered women of color [have] been murdered.” This sounds like a really amazing exhibit.  I definitely plan on going.  Here are the details of the exhibit: The exhibition is open October 13, 2017 through January 31, 2018 Elmer L. Andersen Library Atrium Gallery Exhibit hours: Monday, Tuesday, & Friday | 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Wednesday & Thursday | 8:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. More information here! Love, Hannah
