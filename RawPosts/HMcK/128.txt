The reason that I ask is that I am 6ft 4 in. barefoot, I wear 2 1/2 inch heels, as that is the lowest heel that I am able to find in a size 17 women\u2019s shoe.\u00a0 Flats do not seem to be available in that size. I don\u2019t think anyone is too tall to pass.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think anyone is too\u2026anything to pass in public.\u00a0 The only person\u2019s opinion about whether or not you\u2019re beautiful is your own.\u00a0 What do you care if the guy you walked by at the store doesn\u2019t like your look?\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t affect you.\u00a0 You\u2019ll never please everyone, so focus on making yourself happy.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think you can have standards as to what one should look like to look like a woman because then we have expectations on what a cis-woman \u201cshould\u201d look like.\u00a0 Have you ever looked at a cis-woman and thought she was too tall to look like a woman?\u00a0 Every time I think I am the tallest girl in the mall, I see a girl taller than I am. I say this because I\u2019d like to do my part in moving our community away from the need to \u201cpass\u201d and helping others really examine why passing is a myth and ultimately an unrealistic expectation and holding us back.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know a single cis-woman who worries that she is not pretty enough or short enough or not girlish enough to \u201cpass\u201d as a woman in public.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never heard a cis-woman say that she is too tall and people won\u2019t know she\u2019s a girl.\u00a0 Cis-women know that all women are different and have different bodies and are different sizes.\u00a0 T-girls are not any different. I digress.\u00a0 I am a little over 6 feet tall and I wear everything from flats (no, I\u2019m kidding, I don\u2019t wear flats) to five inch stilettos.\u00a0 I usually leave the stilettos at home and wear a 2 or a 3 inch heel when I go out. I am not trying to pass or blend in by wearing the shorter heel, I dress and wear what I wear based on what is appropriate to where I am going.\u00a0 A tight mini dress and sky high heels are perfect for a club but you\u2019ll stand out at Target. So, mall outfits\u2026   These, not so much.   I am surprised you\u2019re having trouble finding flats in that size.\u00a0 Have you tried visiting this site?\u00a0 I think you\u2019ll have better luck online. I hope this helps!
