Very, very feminine. I like to dress up. I like being a woman I have always felt this. I have always felt that I should be not a masculine being but the other end. I cannot explain it any better then that. When the phase shifts I am again man. I put away the dresses. The shoes (hardest part. I LOVE my shoes). I really don\u2019t know. Am I a t-girl? A wannabe? A pretender?\u00a0 The last thing I want is to diminish the bravery that you and other have shown in show in the world who you are. Are there others like me? Caught between one life or another?\u00a0 Who am I? I think most of go back and forth between how we identify ourselves.\u00a0 Sometimes these identities can change throughout the day, or even longer.\u00a0 Four years ago I identified as a crossdresser; these days it is transgender, but I prefer t-girl.\u00a0 The term transgender does cover a lot of different identities, and labels, if you will. My suggestion is to stop stressing about how you identify.\u00a0 It\u2019s okay if it changes.\u00a0 It probably will, however, the term transgender is a bit of a catch all and likely covers everything we all feel we are. It\u2019s also normal for many of us to shift back and forth between what we feel like doing.\u00a0 Sometimes I feel like reading, sometimes I feel like doing yardwork, sometimes I feel like getting a makeover.\u00a0 You don\u2019t have to pick one thing to do, to wear, or to be. And yes, there are others like you.\u00a0 There are so many like you. As for myself, I fully embrace having two lives, having two genders.\u00a0 Sometimes they blend together but why should I pick one?\u00a0 Some of us do, but I like having options.
