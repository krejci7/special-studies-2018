I am no stranger to the need to fight for our rights, and the right to simply exist is first and foremost. With so many seeking to erase transgender people \u2014 sometimes in the most brutal ways possible \u2014 it is vitally important that those we lose are remembered, and that we continue to fight for justice.\u201d \u2013 Transgender Day of Remembrance founder Gwendolyn Ann Smith Sometimes I feel I am risking my life when I step out.\u00a0 Do you ever feel that fear? Sadly, there are those who have lost their life when they went out.\u00a0 Nothing makes me angrier than someone getting hurt because of who they are.\u00a0 Do you ever feel that anger? 2017 has been the deadliest year yet for the transgender community.
