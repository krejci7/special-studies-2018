From Fader: In July Danica Roem became the first openly transgender person to run for the Virginia House of Delegates. Tuesday night, having won that race, she became the first openly transgender person seated in any state legislature in the country. For her run at the slot, Roem campaigned against incumbent Bob Marshall, a Republican, who had held the seat since 1992.  And that\u2019s not all!  Also from Fader: Shortly after Roem\u2019s race was called, it was announced that in Minnesota, Andrea Jenkins became the \u201cfirst out trans woman of color elected to public office in America,\u201d according to the press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign. Both Roem and Jenkins were preceded by Althea Garrison who, in 1992, served one term in the Massachusetts state legislature though she was not out at the time. What a wonderful night.\u00a0 I think the transcommunity needed a victory like this. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
