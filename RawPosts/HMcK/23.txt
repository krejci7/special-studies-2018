Tonight I had the pleasure once again speaking at the Minnesota Transgender Alliance meeting.  Last month I spoke at the Minneapolis chapter and this evening was the Anoka group.  I spoke about the MN T-Girls, my experiences in being transgender in the Twin Cities and, of course, shopping.  Thank you to everyone with the Minnesota Transgender Alliance and for everyone who attended! Love, Hannah
