Uncategorized modeling photos 
I have been very lucky to have met an incredibly talented photographer two years ago.  Shannonlee, of Fotofida has taken more photographs of me than I could count.  She’s done my modeling photography, photo shoots for the MN T-Girls, as well as those times when I just wanted some new photos taken. Last week was one of those times. I booked a photo shoot with Shannonlee and spent a wonderful four hours with her taking pictures at Casket Arts, a beautiful building in Northeast Minneapolis.  I packed some outfits and high heels, and after an outstanding makeover at Rita Ambourn, I was ready for my photo shoot.  I had a wonderful time.  My face hurt from smiling and I cannot wait to see the photos.  I wanted to share some pictures from the day  I hope you like them!     Love, Hannah
