Last night was the monthly outing for the MN T-Girls and we had such a wonderful time.  Dining en femme was a dream of mine for so long and no matter how many times I dine out, it’s always an incredible experience.  I understand how nerve-wracking it can be, but I have never had a bad experience whether dining alone or with the T-Girls. We dined at Kincaid’s in Saint Paul, a really beautiful restaurant with terrific service and food.  There were a total of nine of us and there were a few girls who were out with the T-Girls for the first time so it’s lovely to meet new friends. Some of us knew each other from previous outings, but for the most part everyone got to know each other for the first time yesterday.  It really is amazing how so many of us have the same experiences and feelings and we are all connected through who we are.  Within minutes we were all chatting as if we were lifelong friends about everything from makeup to family to books.   It has been a busy month for me so I was really looking for ward to getting ready and dolled up and having really yummy food.  I had a chance to wear a new dress I bought back in January on another T-Girl outing and I loved how it looked.  Thank you to Kincaid’s for impeccable hospitality, for delicious food, for always directing us to the ladies’ room and for making us feel welcome.  Thank you to everyone who came last night, see you soon! Love, Hannah
