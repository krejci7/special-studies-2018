At its heart, the MN T-Girls exists as a social and support group.\u00a0 I wanted to create a group that socialized, that went out and did everyday things, such as having a nice dinner or going to the mall.\u00a0 It is a group where one can feel safe when going out into the real world.\u00a0 Many of us felt a mixture of emotions the first, or even the fiftieth time we left the house presenting as the gender we identified as. I knew those emotions because I felt, and sometimes still do, feel them.\u00a0 For years I was afraid to leave the house.\u00a0 What was I afraid of?\u00a0 A million things.\u00a0 Afraid of my car breaking down and being stranded somewhere.\u00a0 Afraid of being recognized, afraid of being harassed, threatened, laughed at, or worse. I was afraid I was not beautiful. There is a vague, unattainable goal of \u201cpassing\u201d for some in our community.\u00a0 Passing is when we, as transwomen, are seen as cis-women.\u00a0 Although I can have flawless makeup and wear a beautiful dress, I still have wide shoulders, large hands and a deep voice.\u00a0 In short, I have many physical characteristics that are normally associated with men.\u00a0 Some of us want to pass because it\u2019s validation and confirmation that our presentation is so amazing that most people would think we were born as females.\u00a0 Some of us look at passing in a desire to be unrecognizable to people that we know who might see us.\u00a0 Some of us just want to pass because it means we are as beautiful as the gender we identify as. But passing is unattainable and vague, and it\u2019s unattainable because it is so vague.\u00a0 There is not a set of standards that one has to meet in order to be female, or to be beautiful.\u00a0 Yes, I am tall (I am even taller in four inch heels), and height is often viewed as a male characteristic and thus \u201cgives me away\u201d. \u00a0 But I have met cis-women who are taller than me.\u00a0 I have met cis-women who have deeper voices than myself.\u00a0 I have met cis-women with facial hair. Are they not women because of those characteristics?\u00a0 What decides what is feminine?\u00a0 Who decides what is beauty?\u00a0 Who decides who is beautiful? No one. Well, you do. It\u2019s not for anyone else to decide.\u00a0 Once I realized that there was no such thing as passing, that there is no standard I had to meet in order to be beautiful, then my whole world change.\u00a0 I was ready to go out. I was still nervous about the same things as before, with the exception of not feeling beautiful enough.\u00a0 Instead of striving to pass, I wanted to blend in.\u00a0 I did my best to blend in the first time I went out, which was about six years ago.\u00a0 I was still learning makeup but my confidence was growing with each day.\u00a0 I was tired of sitting around my living room and was ready to get out into the real world.\u00a0 So, one Friday morning I woke up, did my makeup, got dressed and left the house.\u00a0 The photo on the left is what I wore when I went out for the first time\u2026a cute skirt, a colorful top, cardigan and black stockings.\u00a0 I thought it was a perfect outfit for running errands.\u00a0 For the next few months, I picked out outfits that, in my opinion, helped me blend in.\u00a0 Blending in, I thought, was a form of protection.\u00a0 There are those who have a fear and hatred of people who identify as transgender, and I didn\u2019t want to draw a lot of attention to myself, lest I became a target for ridicule, violence, or worse.\u00a0 Blending in became a sort of camouflage, in a way. As I went out on a more regular basis, I realized that the world wasn\u2019t as scary as I thought it would be.\u00a0 If I was being laughed at and pointed towards, I didn\u2019t notice it.\u00a0 People were kind to me.\u00a0 People complimented my outfit or the skill I had when it came to walking in heels.\u00a0 My confidence grew.\u00a0 My self-esteem grew.\u00a0 Blending in, in those early days, gave me an opportunity to experience life as incognito as possible, considering I am a six foot tall (and taller in heels) transgirl. As my wardrobe grew, I noticed the clothes I was buying were reflecting my growing confidence and courage. \u00a0 I was buying less clothes that I felt helped me blend in and more clothes that, in the corner of mind, I would wear in public when I felt bolder.\u00a0 It would take another year or so until the outfits I wore outside of the house moved from blending in to being bolder.\u00a0 My wardrobe was expanding and was soon filling up with bright colors, bold patterns, higher heels and skirts that showed off all the hard work I put into on the Stairmaster at the gym. Then one day I was done blending in.\u00a0 I am not sure what triggered it, perhaps it was a beautiful day, or a new dress I couldn\u2019t wait to wear.\u00a0 Soon I was at the mall, at the art museum, getting makeovers and having coffee wearing dresses that I never thought I\u2019d have the courage to wear in the real world.\u00a0 Dresses with bright patterns, eye-catching designs and flowers.      A LOT of flowers.   I remember the day I wore the outfit pictured above. I was feeling particularly bold that afternoon and opted for a bright, tight pink dress with matching pink heels.\u00a0 I looked at myself in every mirror I saw at the mall that day and marveled how it didn\u2019t seem that long ago when I tried so hard to blend in, to not be noticed.\u00a0 This outfit was about as far away as incognito as one could get. These days I no longer try to blend in.\u00a0 There\u2019s not much in my closet that I am not comfortable wearing.\u00a0 Of course, I still believe in dressing appropriately, I am not going to wear my leather dress and five inch stilettos to the grocery store, for example.  Looking back at these photos and remembering the past few years, I am amazed at the confidence I\u2019ve gained in such a short time.\u00a0 One of the reasons I formed the MN T-Girls was to show other transwomen that the world can be scary at first, but it\u2019s really quite wonderful once you are out in it.\u00a0 I understand the need and instinct to want to blend in, but standing out is liberating and amazing.\u00a0 You may be surprised by how the world reacts and even embraces you.  There is a hashtag that I saw the other day that reads #wearwhatscaresyou and I really like that idea.\u00a0 The idea of wearing a bright pink dress with sky-high heels terrified me a few years ago, but it\u2019s one of my favorite outfits.\u00a0 To me it screams confidence. Wearing what scares you is a big step, and it took me a couple years to gain the confidence that I needed to do so.\u00a0 But, like wearing high heels, it takes baby steps.\u00a0 Getting a little push doesn\u2019t hurt either.\u00a0 I remember going to Pride and having to stop at the grocery store beforehand.\u00a0 I was wearing a bright pink, polka dot dress to the festival and walking into the store wearing such a eye-catching outfit was a little scary at first.\u00a0 The dress was perfect for a hot summer day at Pride, but very bold for a grocery store visit at 6:30am.\u00a0 However, doing that was one of the little pushes I needed. If you\u2019re looking for a push, you may want to consider \u2018Try-Day Friday\u2019, a challenge that was started by Dia & Co, an online clothing company that provides their customers with new outfits that are designed to create confidence and help take fashion risks. Despite many things happening in our country, I am feeling optimistic for our community.\u00a0 We are making progress, socially and politically.\u00a0 It\u2019s not always been easy, but baby steps, you know? I am also excited about your growing confidence.\u00a0 Yes, yours.\u00a0 Do something that scares you, wear something that scares you. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
