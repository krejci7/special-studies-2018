Hi!\u00a0 Talking to other t-girls and crossdressers is certainly an option when it comes to makeup, however I have learned more about makeup by talking to makeup artists and having makeovers. Facial shape and facial structures are wildly different from person to person.\u00a0 Talking to a makeup artist will be beneficial as they are trained to contour, highlight and reduce certain facial features (if you want) and to help you do your own makeup.\u00a0 No two people do their makeup the same way.\u00a0 Learn what is right for you. \u00a0 There are some tricks I learned from other t-girls, specifically when it comes to color correcting and beard cover but I learned so much more by meeting with makeup artists and being taught which makeup is right for my skin, tone and color.\u00a0 My advice is to schedule a makeover and ask a lot of questions.\u00a0 I have some suggestions where you can go on my blog. As for meeting other girls, I would recommend creating a profile and chatting online at various forums, such as crossdresssers.com and urnotalone.\u00a0 When I wanted to meet others like myself I started the MN T-Girls, so you may want to consider starting your own group. Good luck, have fun, be safe! Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
