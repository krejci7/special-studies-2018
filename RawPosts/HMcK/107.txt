When I started going out, I was worried about what people would think of me, say to me or even do to me.  But years of going out have really helped ease this tension.  The last few years have been illuminating in many ways as I am constantly surprised at how little anyone cares and how wonderful people can be.  I think interacting with kids have been the most surprising.  When I do see kids, they do stare at me.  But when I smile at them, they smile back.  I do wonder what this generation will be like as they get older since transgender men and women are in the news, entertainment and even children’s books.  Society is normalizing being transgender to this generation.  I think shows like SheZow are a step in the right direction. Explaining what being transgender is can be hard and easy at the same time, and explaining things to kids is a different type of easy and hard.  I wanted to share a post on Huffinging Post that featured some great resources for talking to kids about what being transgender means.
