The party was held at a rented suite and everyone brought something to share, whether it was a bottle of wine or Christmas cookies.\u00a0 We all looked fabulous in our sparkly holiday dresses.\u00a0 Over the course of the night there were around twenty of us and it was so fun to meet new friends.\u00a0 I was so proud of those who were out for the very first time and so happy for those who brought their amazing, supportive. wives. It was a wonderful way to end the year as we looked back over everything that not only the group has done in 2016, but how we all have grown as individuals as well.\u00a0 So many of us had milestones this year, whether it was coming out to people in our lives or leaving the house for the first time. Thank you the MN T-Girls for making the party as well as 2016 a success.\u00a0 I can\u2019t wait for next year! Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
