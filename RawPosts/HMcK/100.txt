From the magazine: \u201cThe story of gender plays out all around us. More and more, celebrities are shining a spotlight on the subject. But more quietly, our children, parents, teachers, medical professionals, and officials every day confront an array of issues with gender at the center. Everywhere we looked, in the U.S. and around the globe, individuals and organizations are fighting to redefine traditional gender roles, whether it is girls in war-torn Sierra Leone rejecting the cultural norm of female genital mutilation and child marriage, men in Sweden making use of extended paternal leave after having a child, or people who reject binary, boy-girl labels and find their true identity elsewhere on a gender spectrum. This is why we\u2019re devoting the January issue of National Geographic magazine entirely to an exploration of gender issues \u2014 in science, social systems, and civilizations \u2014 and decided to feature the first transgender person on the cover of our magazine: nine-year-old Avery Jackson.\u201d What struck me about the cover and the upcoming article is how much I appreciate a respected media source such as National Geographic putting our community out front in such a public, positive and matter-of-fact way.\u00a0 Being transgender is hard to explain to ourselves, let alone to someone else.\u00a0 It is wonderful to read an article like this that explains what being transgender is and what it means in a clearer way than I ever could.
