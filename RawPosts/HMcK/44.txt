Everyone we met was friendly, positive and welcoming.\u00a0 There were vendors from organizations from all over the state and I spent a lot of time chatting with Transforming Families and the Minnesota Transgender Alliance,\u00a0 which I have added to the Transgender Resources page.  There was a total of six MN T-Girls there today and we had a lovely time wandering around the booths, eating yummy food, making new friends and taking photos.\u00a0 It was supposed to rain afternoon but as you can see it was a lovely day.  It was such a fun day and next year I plan on going to many more Pride events.\u00a0 Hope to see you there! Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
