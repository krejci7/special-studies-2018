There were a total of six of us getting our portraits taken.\u00a0 We had a lot of wardrobe changes and the day was filled with the sound of high heels clicking on hardwood floors.  It was a day none of us will forget anytime soon.\u00a0 Thanks to Shannonlee for such a perfect day.   Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
