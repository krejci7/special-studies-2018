I think we can have a lot of anxiety when it comes to visiting a doctor as not every transgender person is the same and many of us are still going back in forth between genders, sometimes even on a day-to-day basis.  Trusting someone with who we are is not easy as it’s sometimes hard for us to understand ourselves who we are, let alone explaining this to someone else. Huffington Post has an interesting article about this and I think it’s totally worth a read. Love, Hannah
