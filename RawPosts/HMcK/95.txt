So we marked the day by being together, by having coffee, by going shopping and trying on (and buying) dresses and having dinner.\u00a0 It was wonderful. I hadn\u2019t been out for a while so I really was looking forward to our day.\u00a0 The Macy\u2019s location in downtown Minneapolis is scheduled to close this spring and since Macy\u2019s has a history of being pro-transgender, I thought a day out shopping would be a lot of fun. I headed downtown early to just enjoy being out and I was glad the weather was so nice and warm so I could wear my new dress.\u00a0 I did some window shopping and a had a coffee before I met up with the girls.   We met up at Starbucks, had a coffee and chatted for a bit before shopping!  It was a lot of fun shopping in a big group.\u00a0 We browsed the racks, looked at shoes and tried on a lot of dresses.\u00a0 We spent about two hours picking out outfits and clothes and had a lot of fun.   I had a lot of fun trying on new dresses and I ended up buying two, but I really regret not picking up the long gold gown I tried on.\u00a0 Maybe next time.    After we maxed out our credit cards it was time for dinner at The Union, just down the block from Macy\u2019s.  It was a wonderful way to spend the day and I can\u2019t wait for next month\u2019s event! Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
