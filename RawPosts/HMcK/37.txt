There’s a certain joy that comes with finding a pair of heels that perfectly match a dress you already own.  I picked up this dress about two years ago and last year I found these heels that seem to have been made for it. This was the first outfit I wore during my recent photo session with Shannonlee. Hope you like these pictures! Love, Hannah
