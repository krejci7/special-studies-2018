Coming out as transgender can be challenging to our loved ones.\u00a0 My family is accepting, supportive and are definitely advocates of the LGBTQ community.\u00a0 However, regardless of how much of an ally you are, it can be difficult when someone you love comes out.  Identifying as transgender can add additional questions to our loved ones.\u00a0 I\u2019ve written before how being transgender can mean something different from individual to individual.\u00a0 Some of us have transitioned, or want to transition, and for some of us it\u2019s never crossed our mind.\u00a0 Accepting a family member as transgender isn\u2019t easy, but there is also the additional question of what it means to them and possibly what\u2019s next for them.  My family knows they can go shopping or have a cup of coffee with Hannah whenever they\u2019d like, but I don\u2019t press anyone with this part of me.\u00a0 I have also written previously about how I think it\u2019s important we try to be conscious of who we are to our loved ones and be gentle and considerate when we come out.  Of course, if we waited for everyone we know to be \u201cready\u201d to meet us, we may never get to be ourselves.\u00a0 I also am speaking as someone who does not want to live full-time, so it\u2019s easier for me to accommodate my dual genders and the rest of my life.\u00a0 I realize everyone\u2019s needs and lives our different, and can only speak for myself.
