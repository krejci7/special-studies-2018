In November of 2015, the MN T-Girls visited Sidhe Brewing Company, a local beer brewer in Saint Paul where one of the owners is a transwoman.  Here’s us enjoying a drink.  City Pages has written an article about Kathleen Culhane  as part of the their People Issue featuring women and men who make Minnesota a nicer place to live.  I am not much of a drinker but I think it’s  wonderful to see a transwoman on this list. Cheers! Love, Hannah
