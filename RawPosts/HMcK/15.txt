Was it hard to go out in public for the first time, and what was your friends and family\u2019s response? It was hard to go out the first time, but each time I\u2019ve gone out it has gotten easier.\u00a0 The first time you go out, I would recommend going to a PFLAG meeting or another LGBTQ support group.\u00a0 Knowing you are going to meet a supportive group of people will make our first time out a little easier. Before you go out, please make sure you are ready.\u00a0 Before I go out, I always make sure my purse has: -Eyeliner -Lipstick -Finishing powder -Mascara That\u2019s the fun stuff.\u00a0 The reality is that I have a lot more in my purse than makeup.\u00a0 I recommend every t-girl have the following in their purse: -Cash.\u00a0 This is pretty obvious but I use cash for everything when I go out.\u00a0 If I want to get a coffee or need to pay for parking, I use cash.\u00a0 I like cash because I don\u2019t run the risk of turning over my credit card (with my male name) to a cashier.\u00a0 I also bring my debit and credit card just in case. -Proof of car insurance.\u00a0 If you get into an accident or get pulled over, you\u2019ll need to provide proof of insurance.\u00a0 Simple enough but plan for the worst. -Fully charged cell phone.\u00a0 Pretty self-explanatory.\u00a0 You\u2019ll need it in case of emergency.\u00a0 Any emergency. -Roadside assistance information.\u00a0 You need to know who to contact if you get a flat tire.\u00a0 Sure, I can change a tire myself, but no way I am doing that in a dress or heels. -Driver\u2019s license.\u00a0 Again, if you get pulled over\u2026 -Spare car key.\u00a0 If you\u2019re not used to carrying a purse, you might forget to place your keys in it.\u00a0 A spare key tucked in your purse saves a call to a locksmith. -Medical insurance card.\u00a0 Again, plan for the worst. -A friend.\u00a0 I don\u2019t mean bring a friend with you, though shopping is a lot more fun if you do, but if you\u2019re out to anyone in your life, drop them a message to let them know you\u2019re stepping out.\u00a0 It\u2019s good to let someone know you\u2019re out on the town in case you need help. -I would also recommend downloading the Uber or Lyft app.\u00a0 If you run into car troubles and need help, having this on your phone can be a lifesaver.\u00a0 I have an app on my phone and I have multiple accounts associated with it.\u00a0 One for my male life, one for Hannah.\u00a0 I\u2019ve used Uber as both genders and I\u2019ve never had an issue. Where should you go? Anywhere you want, but plan ahead.\u00a0 Is there a GLBT friendly coffee shop in town?\u00a0 Maybe start there.\u00a0 Or a GLBT bar?\u00a0 That\u2019s another option.\u00a0 For your first time out, some of us go someplace where they\u2019re used to seeing girls like us.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to get used to being out in public and it\u2019s easier if you know you\u2019re not the first t-girl, or the only t-girl there.\u00a0 If there\u2019s not a place like that in your area, I bet there\u2019s a PFLAG or a Tri-Ess chapter that meets near you. Being comfortable out will take time but you will get there.\u00a0 I never thought I\u2019d go to a restaurant or a mall or a gas station in heels, but I do it all the time. Not comfortable yet in your area?\u00a0 Drive to a bigger city.\u00a0 Get a hotel room there, have an adventure!\u00a0 Bigger cities tend to be more liberal and open minded than smaller towns.\u00a0 When I go to downtown Minneapolis, I walk down the street confident in knowing I am not the first or last transgirl to strut that street that day.\u00a0 Bigger cities have seen girls like us before. Will people see you?\u00a0 Of course they will.\u00a0 You\u2019re out in public.\u00a0 Will they point?\u00a0 Will they laugh?\u00a0 Will they whisper behind your back?\u00a0 Maybe.\u00a0 But really, so what?\u00a0 I go out all the time and very, very rarely does anything like that happen.\u00a0 And the more often I go out, the less I notice it.\u00a0 Will people recognize you?\u00a0 Maybe.\u00a0 If you\u2019re afraid of that happening, again, go to a different town. I know I was nervous people would point and snicker while I was out in the real world, but that hasn\u2019t really happened to me.\u00a0 I\u2019ve interacted with everyone from baristas to shop clerks to gas station employees to waiters and I\u2019ve never had a bad experience.\u00a0 No one has been rude or laughed or anything.\u00a0 The world is a wonderful place sometimes. Safety is the number one concern, of course.\u00a0 I know what parts of my city are safer and I\u2019m sure you do too so don\u2019t go there.\u00a0 Go somewhere where you can park in a well lit area as well.\u00a0 Going out for the first time is nerve wracking enough but going someplace a little iffy is just adding more stress that you don\u2019t need. Looking back, I have only come out to my friends who are LGBTQ, and it\u2019s all gone very well.\u00a0 Now that I think about it, I have only come out to maybe five friends. Coming out to my mom and sisters were both very different experiences.\u00a0 I think if I were to do it all over again, I definitely would do things differently.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019ve written a little about this previously.\u00a0 But, the short version is that my family loves me, they understand me as best they can and I love them.
