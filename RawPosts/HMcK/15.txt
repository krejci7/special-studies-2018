This is the second of the four dresses I wore for my recent photo shoot with Shannonlee. I’ve had this dress for a while and I think I’ve only worn it once.  It’s one of those dresses you rediscover in your closet and wonder why you don’t wear it all the time. I hope you like these pictures! Love, Hannah
