This time of year you see girls getting ready for prom or to be in a wedding.\u00a0 This season stirs up the desire to be beautiful, the intense pangs of jealousy.\u00a0 When I was in high school I would see my female friends at a formal dance and couldn\u2019t decide if I wanted to in love with them or if I wanted to look like them.\u00a0 It was an intense\u2026awakening, a turning point in my life.\u00a0 Ultimately I would choose both. This longing to pick out a beautiful gown, to find the perfect heels and to have an amazing makeover doesn\u2019t ever go away.\u00a0 It\u2019s always there\u2026but it\u2019s never stronger or louder than right now.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t go to prom when I was a senior, but I wanted to.\u00a0 I was dating a girl but we broke up a few weeks before the dance.\u00a0 We had planned to go, and I lived vicariously through her as she recounted her experiences of shopping for the gown she ultimately would not wear.\u00a0 If I was honest with myself,\u00a0 I wanted to go to prom as a girl.\u00a0 I wanted to spend weeks looking for a dress, the shoes and accessories.\u00a0 I wanted the makeup and hair appointment, I wanted the photos, the going out to dinner at an upscale restaurant, the limo\u2026everything.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t even want to go with someone, it would have been enough to just go, to be my own date. When my high school days passed I had hopes of being a bridesmaid.\u00a0 I wanted to experience going dress shopping with other girls, trying on countless gowns\u2026just thinking about it makes me smile. I am lucky to have experienced so many moments as Hannah, but it also hits me on occasion knowing that there are so many things that I likely never will.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had many makeovers, many photographs taken, and I have a beautiful wardrobe.\u00a0 But being the most beautiful girl at a gala, in the room, the center of a dance floor, or a wedding photograph feels impossible. I think you all know what I feel. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
