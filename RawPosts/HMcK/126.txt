I think many of us knew there was something unique about us at a very young age.  I never thought there was something ‘wrong’ with me because I wanted to wear pretty dresses growing up, but I knew it wasn’t something everyone did.  I remember being as young as five and wanting to wear lipstick and secretly trying on my mom’s heels when she wasn’t looking. I saw this article on Buzzfeed and it got me thinking about when I was young.  It wasn’t a term that was around then, but I suppose I would have been called gender variant or gender non-conforming then.  I never thought that clothes had a gender. From the article: In October 2015, Nicole buckled in to her mom’s Prius, along with her older brother, mom, dad, and a bag full of her favorite dolls, for a three-hour drive to see a doctor about her new life. Over the past 18 months, the 9-year-old had grown out her black curly hair from a crew cut to a flouncy bob just below her ears. She had traded in pants and overalls for pink and purple dresses covered in rhinestones. And she had changed her name, ditching the common boys name that now made her cringe to hear. It had been a challenging time for Nicole’s parents, Kim and Andrew, whose conservative Christian circle of friends in Texas rejected the entire family after seeing the changes in this kid. Nicole was happier than she’d ever been, but the trip ahead still made her anxious. So, trying to calm her nerves, Kim switched on her daughter’s favorite book on tape, Hank the Cowdog, and stopped to get her kolaches, the Czech pastries that Central Texas is known for. Then she gave her an early birthday present: Next year, when she turned 10, they would get her a prized American Girl doll, just as they had for her older sister a decade earlier. Read the rest here.
