If there is one thing that over thirty years of crossdressing has taught me, its that this\u2026desire, need, urge, call it what you will, will never go away.\u00a0 This is who you are.\u00a0 You cannot outgrow this, you cannot quit this,\u00a0 you cannot deny this is who you are and what you want to wear. I don\u2019t think ignoring this part of us is useful.\u00a0 Nor do I think it is effective.\u00a0 I\u00a0 believe if this is who you are, then you should let yourself be yourself.\u00a0 I understand that this needs to be kept a secret.\u00a0 I keep this a secret from almost everyone in my life but I still feel I can be myself. \u00a0I know some t-girls who dress up just a few times a year.\u00a0 Sometimes they take a vacation and spend time as their other selves in a different city.\u00a0 I know some girls who just check into a hotel for the weekend and dress up and never leave their room.\u00a0 You just have to find a way to make it work.\u00a0 It depends on how far you want to go.\u00a0 For some, wearing a skirt while watching television is all they want.\u00a0 There are those who just want to underdress.\u00a0 For some, they want everything from the tips of their false eyelashes to the point of their stiletto. Of course, you\u2019ll want to consider who you are keeping this a secret from.\u00a0 If you are married or in a committed relationship, I don\u2019t think you should be deceptive.\u00a0 I hope you can find a way to tell your significant other about this part of you.\u00a0 It will, of course, likely come as a shock, but you will inevitably get caught, regardless of how careful you are, or think you are.\u00a0 I hear stories on a fairly regular basis from crossdressers who were caught by their significant other and not only did they have the discussion about crossdressing itself, there was the additional issue of their partner being lied to.\u00a0 If you told her you were on a business trip when you really spent the week visiting a different city and trying on heels, she will likely feel betrayed and deceived\u2026because, quite honestly, you lied to her.\u00a0 It will takes years for a relationship to recover from feeling deceived, if it recovers at all.\u00a0 I think many partners are hurt more about being deceived than about the dressing itself.\u00a0 I may have made a lot of mistakes in my life, but one thing I did right was telling my wife about myself after only a few months of dating.\u00a0 I had to.\u00a0 This is who I was and she deserved the truth. I hope this helps!\u00a0 Be safe and be honest. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
