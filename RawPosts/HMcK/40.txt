Today the MN T-Girls had a little road trip and went to Saint Cloud which is about an hour north of the Minneapolis/Saint Paul area.  Saint Cloud held their annual Pride Festival this weekend and I am so glad we went.  Everyone we met was friendly, positive and welcoming.  There were vendors from organizations from all over the state and I spent a lot of time chatting with Transforming Families and the Minnesota Transgender Alliance,  which I have added to the Transgender Resources page.  There was a total of six MN T-Girls there today and we had a lovely time wandering around the booths, eating yummy food, making new friends and taking photos.  It was supposed to rain afternoon but as you can see it was a lovely day.  It was such a fun day and next year I plan on going to many more Pride events.  Hope to see you there! Love, Hannah
