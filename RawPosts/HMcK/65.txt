I have been wearing heels, dresses and anything else you can name for as far back as I can remember.\u00a0 Well, maybe wearing isn\u2019t the right phrase, perhaps \u201ctrying to wear\u201d is more appropriate.\u00a0 I recall being as young as four and searching the closet for my mom\u2019s high heels.\u00a0 Even when I was young, I didn\u2019t think there was anything \u201cwrong\u201d with me, I just liked what I liked.\u00a0 But I somehow knew my wardrobe preferences should be kept a secret. Until perhaps fifteen years ago, terror and crossdressing went hand in hand.\u00a0 I was terrified whenever I worked up the courage to go to Target to buy panties at the chance of someone bumping into me.\u00a0 I was terrified someone would open my closet and see my stilettos. \u00a0 I was terrified all the time of being caught. After I came out to my girlfriend, whom I later married, the fear went away for the most part.\u00a0 The person whose opinion really mattered knew all about me and I didn\u2019t need to hide anymore.\u00a0 I slowly started posting on forums, such as crossdressers.com, soon photos appeared and, well, now I have this website. The fear faded as I grew older and started to realize that it was unlikely I would be \u201ccaught\u201d.\u00a0 As far as I know, I have kept this a secret from everyone that I haven\u2019t come out to.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have any fear going out at all, either.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think Hannah looks like male me unless you were close enough, but then again, I may be fooling myself.\u00a0 But I really don\u2019t think I am. Having this blog and posting photos does open up the chance of being \u201ccaught\u201d.\u00a0 Am I afraid someone in my male life would see it?\u00a0 Not really.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think this is the kind of site you just stumble upon.\u00a0 I think you\u2019d find my site if you were looking for a site like mine.\u00a0 And if you\u2019re looking for a site like mine, well, you probably understand the importance of keeping a secret. The other day I was thinking about our fear of being caught.\u00a0 It\u2019s true, I don\u2019t want to be caught, but I was thinking if there\u2019s anyone in my male life that knows about me that I don\u2019t know of.\u00a0 It is entirely possible that someone has seen me in the mall carrying a Victoria\u2019s Secret bag or at Ulta picking up foundation.\u00a0 It is possible someone has found my site, either on accident or on purpose.\u00a0 If someone has see me and are respecting my privacy, then I truly appreciate it. However. If someone does know about me, I really wouldn\u2019t mind if you let me know that you know.\u00a0 Unless of course you think I am weird or doing something wrong, then you can keep pretending that you don\u2019t know.\u00a0 But if you know me, if you know the male me, you can tell me.\u00a0 I don\u2019t like keeping secrets, but we all know how important it is to keep this secret.\u00a0 If you know the male me and want to meet Hannah, let me know.\u00a0 She would like to meet you, too.
