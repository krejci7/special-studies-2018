I woke up, picked out one of my favorite floral dresses and nude heels and left my house in search of adventure.\u00a0 I ended up at the Mall of America.\u00a0 I think for many of us in Minnesota we look visiting this mall as a challenge.\u00a0 It\u2019s huge, has a ton on people and can be intimidating.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been to the mall as Hannah before and was excited to return. I arrived at the mall before most stores had opened and enjoyed listening to the click of my heels on the floor as I wandered around having a coffee.\u00a0 I caught the eye of other shoppers and I did what I always do when someone looks at me, I smiled at them.\u00a0 And more often than not, they smiled back.  A smile can disarm, a smile can put someone at ease and smiling back when someone smiles at us is a reflex. \u00a0 There was one lady in particular who just\u2026stared at me and I just kept smiling.\u00a0 I thought about what she would tell her friends later. \u201cI saw one of those\u2026transgendered people at the mall.\u201d \u201cWhat happened?\u201d \u201cShe\u2026smiled at me\u201d. Yes, we are pretty scary. As I strolled through the mall, I heard someone say \u201coh, will you look at the model!\u201d\u00a0 I turned and saw a couple sitting on a bench waiting for a store to open.\u00a0 I sat down with them and had a wonderful conversation with them.\u00a0 They were a retired couple from Norway who were in town to meet their daughter who was flying into Minneapolis from Alaska.\u00a0 We had about a 20 minute chat and my heart grew with happiness.  I stopped in a lot of stores and tried on dresses looking for a new outfit.\u00a0 I also took advantage of all the giant mirrors.   I had so much fun.\u00a0 After my recent post I was inspired to try on a few gowns as well.\u00a0 Look at this dress, could you imagine wearing it at ball?  I had a wonderful adventure at the mall.\u00a0 I look at my time as Hannah truly as adventures.\u00a0 I never know what will happen.\u00a0 Maybe I will find the perfect dress or talk to a retired pastor from Norway.\u00a0 What I do know is that people are generally very kind and they might look at you as they have never seen a transperson before\u2026and it\u2019s possible they haven\u2019t. It\u2019s impossible and a waste of time trying to determine what people are thinking when they see you.\u00a0 Regardless of what they think, it can\u2019t affect you.\u00a0 How you think about yourself is the only thing that matters.\u00a0 If someone does stare at me, I like to imagine they are thinking \u201cwow, she\u2019s tall\u201d or \u201cwhat a beautiful dress!\u201d and \u201chow does she walk in those heels?\u201d. People will stare, but mostly they just smile back. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
