One of the joys for me as a CD is when I wear dresses. And then January hits and everything freezes! My question pertains to legwear and shoes. Obviously tights ( one or two pair) are the most warm, but what kind of shoes are appropriate? And is it ok to wear more sheer stockings with open toed shoes or strappy heels? What\u2019s a T girl to do? I am totally the wrong girl to ask when it comes to appropriate shoes. Yes, it\u2019s cold out but unless I plan on spending a lot of time outside I usually will stick with what some would consider not-so-sensible shoes.\u00a0 If the weather doesn\u2019t allow this, then I stick with knee-high boots. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and everyone can wear what they want, but I don\u2019t think open-toed shoes go with non-nude stockings and tights.\u00a0 I am always wearing stockings and usually go with nude as I like how they show off my legs and even out my skin tone.\u00a0 Nude stockings will also allow me to wear open-toed heels, too.
