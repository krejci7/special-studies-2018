Ignoring what others think of us can be pretty simple.\u00a0 However, it becomes devastating when others tell us what they think of us.\u00a0 Although almost experience I\u2019ve had has been either mundane or positive, I\u2019ve still had a few instances where someone has said something disparaging to me.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had two instances this year where someone said something that wasn\u2019t very nice but by then I\u2019ve been going out for years and I felt pretty invincible.\u00a0 I can\u2019t imagine anyone saying anything at this point in my life that would really affect me.\u00a0 However, if negative comments were said in the first couple times I went out, it might be a different story. I thought about all this as I read about a documentary called \u201cWalking While Trans\u201d produced by the website Mic.\u00a0 According to the article, Mic\u00a0has produced a series of videos capturing the personal and often insidious moments of aggression and judgment directed at transgender people in public spaces. To capture this, a shooter walked in front of, behind and alongside four different trans individuals while they walked through the streets of New York, filming the ambiguous and ultimately universal moments where strangers glance at one another, with no idea what the other may be thinking.\u00a0 I encourage you all to watch this video and read this article.  Be safe.\u00a0 Be happy.\u00a0 Happy New Year. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Hannah McKnight"}
