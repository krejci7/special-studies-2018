But that\u2019s not realistic. For some, it would be wonderful for us to \u201cpass\u201d, to appear in public without anyone thinking that we are genetically male or transgender.\u00a0 I have written pretty extensively about my perspective about\u00a0\u201cpassing\u201d previously and although I don\u2019t believe in \u201cpassing\u201d, I understand why this is a goal for some of us.\u00a0 It was a goal for myself years ago but I don\u2019t care at all what others think of who I am when I go out.\u00a0 For some of us, we want to be able to look so feminine that no one will think we were born male. But that\u2019s not realistic. What helped me go beyond the idea of passing was simply slipping on a pair of heels and experiencing the world as who I am.\u00a0 I absolutely accept that it\u2019s incredibly likely that anyone who sees me knows that I am transgender, but my experiences taught me that the vast majority of people in the world could care less.\u00a0 That first time out during the day I interacted with baristas, cashiers, people at Target and restaurant servers and had nothing but positive or at least mundane experiences.\u00a0 Some people went out of their way to be kind and some didn\u2019t even bat an eye when they saw me.\u00a0 I had low expectations the first time I went out.\u00a0 I was scared to death and was hoping that no one would laugh at me or threaten me or set me on fire for being a threat to society.\u00a0 That didn\u2019t happen and I am pleased that even after all these years I still have not been burned at the stake.\u00a0 My experiences taught me that no one really cares that I\u2019m transgender.\u00a0 It would be incredible if no one in the world cared if anyone was transgender. But that\u2019s not realistic. We live in a world were people hate us, fear us, misunderstand us and do not even try to.\u00a0 We live in a world where laws are consistently introduce to repress our rights.\u00a0 We live in a world where the CDC has banned the very name many of us use to identify who we are.\u00a0 We live in a world were transgender men and women do get harassed, threatened, hurt and killed on a daily basis simply for existing. But this will surely change, right?\u00a0 Maybe not for a couple years but this will change, right? No.\u00a0 It won\u2019t. That\u2019s not pessimism.\u00a0 That\u2019s reality.\u00a0 Social justice and social change takes decades, even centuries sometimes, if the change happens at all.\u00a0 Look back throughout history and you will see that we can pass all the laws we want, but that doesn\u2019t mean everything is fine.\u00a0 Sure, women were given the right to vote in 1920 but that didn\u2019t solve the problem of gender inequality.\u00a0 Slavery was abolished in 1865 but the Klu Klux Klan still exists.\u00a0 I do not expect the hatred and misunderstanding of who we are to go away in my lifetime, in yours, or in the next generation\u2019s lifetime.\u00a0 It would be nice\u2026 But that\u2019s not realistic. So, how do we live and be happy and accept ourselves when so many things we want are not realistic?\u00a0 For starters, you just have to strut out of the house, head held high wearing a smile and not give a second thought to what others are thinking\u2026because for the most part, they don\u2019t care.\u00a0 And really, how will you know what they think?\u00a0 Are you planning on asking them?\u00a0 If there\u2019s anything I want others to take away from my blog it\u2019s how to manage our expectations when reality might be working against us.\u00a0 For myself, it would be wonderful if I could spend just 15 minutes on my makeup and head out the door.\u00a0 But the reality is that I am genetically male and hair grows out of my cheeks, neck and all over my face.\u00a0 I can shave very closely, but I still have a light hue to my face.\u00a0 So, in my reality, I need to do some color correcting and add three layers of different foundations to counter that.\u00a0 It would also be idea if I could just pop into Target and find a new pair of heels that fit, but in my reality I need to shop at stores that sell heels that go up to size 11 1/2 and most stores stop selling shoes after size 11.\u00a0 So close. My shopping reality takes a little adapting, but it\u2019s fine.\u00a0 I\u2019ve learned how to live with it.\u00a0 My reality also means, at times, a complicated relationship with some people in my life, but again, I\u2019ve readjusted my expectations.\u00a0 It would be wonderful if we could all be who we are without fear of\u2026anything from anyone in our lives, from the gas station cashier to our parents.\u00a0 It would be amazing if everyone accepted us, loved us.\u00a0 It would be incredible for us to have \u201cpermission\u201d to walk out the door in our favorite dress without fear of anything. But that\u2019s not realistic. Instead, we can accept ourselves.\u00a0 We can love ourselves.\u00a0 Acceptance and permission does not need to come from the government, from society or from our families.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t need to.\u00a0 Even if we were given this from others, it doesn\u2019t matter if we don\u2019t give this to ourselves.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to be who we are.\u00a0 I get that.\u00a0 I know that.\u00a0 For those who are not where they want to be this is very much understood.\u00a0 For those who have accepted and embraced who we are we know that this did not come easy, and it\u2019s still not always easy. Reality is\u2026well, it\u2019s difficult at best.\u00a0 We cannot wait for reality to line up with what we want to be who we are.\u00a0 If you are waiting for everyone in the world to signal that it\u2019s okay to be transgender then you\u2019ll be waiting a very, very long time.\u00a0 Instead, it\u2019s time to buy that dress and hit the mall.\u00a0 The museum.\u00a0 The steps of the capital.\u00a0 Anywhere you want.\u00a0 Any acceptance, tolerance and legal right we have came from those before us.\u00a0 The brave men and women who marched, who demonstrated, who were arrested, who were hurt and killed for what we have have brought attention and change to our social and legal status.\u00a0 We may not have everything we want or deserve, but it\u2019s slowly, slowly getting there.\u00a0 But what we have came from some form of activism, whether it was a protest, a campaign or by simply existing.\u00a0 I like to think that when I am out in the real world I am helping create awareness that transpeople exist and that we\u2019re normal and not a threat to a society.\u00a0 I like to think that the more people see us, the more unremarkable we become to others which leads to more acceptance. If we want to the real world to accept us, then we need to get out in the real world.\u00a0 So yes, getting a makeover and hitting the mall looking amazing can lead to social change.\u00a0 How fun is that? It\u2019s unrealistic to wait for the world to love us and accept us before we let ourselves be who we are, or want to be.\u00a0 Be you.\u00a0 Be you now.
