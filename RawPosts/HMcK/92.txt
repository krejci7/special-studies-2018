We live in  complex world that is filled with anti-LGBTQ bills looming and trangender models such as Andrea Pejic, Geena Rocero, and now Anjali Lama.  Huffington Post and Pink News just posted fascinating articles about Lama, the first trans person to be featured in Mumbai’s famous fashion week.  I love seeing articles and girls like this. I think we live in a world where we go two steps forward, and one step back. Love, Hannah
