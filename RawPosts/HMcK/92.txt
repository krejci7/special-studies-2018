It was a small group, just six of us and we had a nice evening enjoying some drinks and girl talk, chatting about everything from makeup to shoes to family. As I looked around the table I reflected about although it was small group at the moment, I was amazed at how many of us are out there and how alike we are. We all go through the same experiences, whether family members not quite understanding or accepting us, or the challenges with finding heels or the thrill of an amazing makeover.\u00a0 We are lucky to find others like us.\u00a0 I know many of us have felt like we are the only ones in the world who do what we do, but we\u2019re not.\u00a0 You are not alone, and never have been.\u00a0 We all know how we feel, we all know how each other feels, It was wonderful catching up with some old and fabulous friends.
