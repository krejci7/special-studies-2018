About seven years ago, when I made the shift from under-dressing to actual clothes, I was drawn to evening wear and beautiful gowns.\u00a0 I was, and still in love with flowing evening gowns\u2026but dresses like that are rather expensive so when I started building my wardrobe I started with little black dresses.\u00a0 I was insecure and timid when I started to wear dresses and black is a pretty forgiving (and slimming) color.\u00a0 It was a few years before I felt confident to wear bold colors and patterns. At one point I owned about a half dozen LBDs but when I lost weight I dropped a few dress sizes and they didn\u2019t fit anymore.\u00a0 I think this is the only black dress I have in my wardrobe these days. I hope you like these photos.\u00a0 Shannonlee did an amazing job of capturing a side of me I always wanted to see.\u00a0 Thank you for indulging me over the past few weeks as I showed what may have seemed like an endless stream of photos.\u00a0  Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
