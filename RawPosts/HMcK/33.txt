This is not an invitation to discuss gun laws, so please be mindful of that in the comments. A country\u2019s obligation and role in protecting its people extends in many different ways.\u00a0 Whether it is protecting our personal rights, having access to proper medical and mental care, as well as ensuring our civil rights are maintained. This week we saw the Trump administration roll back the mandate that employers provide insurance coverage for contraception based on religious freedom.\u00a0 This, of course, will open the door to other discriminating changes that are also based on religious freedom, potentially rights that protect the LGBTQ community. What does this have to do with the transcommunity?\u00a0 Well, everything. I think most of us here believe that transwomen are women.\u00a0 Issues that affect cis-women are also issues that transwomen should be concerned about as well.\u00a0 While it is true that reproductive issues may not affect a transwoman personally, we should be outraged when any right of any woman is denied, especially when it comes to one\u2019s healthcare.\u00a0 If we want to be viewed and accepted as women when we visit the mall in a cute dress and heels, then we must also champion for the rights of ALL women. If the GOP wants to deny healthcare to cis-women, whether directly or indirectly, then they will not hesitate to take away the protection of transwomen.\u00a0 Which brings me to my next point. If you had any doubt that the Republicans hated us, this week also saw the Trump administration end workplace protection for the transgender community.\u00a0 Unless it\u2019s in an effort to be needlessly cruel, I do not see any point in going out of your way to take away a civil right from us.\u00a0 This week was a busy week for this administration as they somehow also found time to request a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s ban on transgender people in the military.\u00a0 One would think that escalating tensions with North Korea, hurricane recovery in Puerto Rico and mass shooting in Las Vegas would take more precedent than stripping away the rights of women and the LGBTQ community. Things were going, well perhaps not well, but things were less terrible for us not too long ago.\u00a0 What happened? Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
