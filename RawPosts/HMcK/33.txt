This is one of the oldest dresses that I own.  I bought it about five years ago and it…well, it shows off my legs nicely and is perfect if I don’t have to sit down for a while.  I wanted to wear it for my recent photoshoot with Shannonlee mainly because of the incredibly perfect heels I found a few years later. Love, Hannah
