I am thrilled to reveal some of the final photos that I shot with Minneapolis photographer Shannonlee of Fotofida.\u00a0 I\u2019ve done quite a few photo shoots with her already and it\u2019s always a thrill to work with her. I am excited to share some of the final photos from that day.\u00a0 These and other photos are up on Glamour Boutique\u2019s newsletter and website but you can also see more here.\u00a0 I hope you like them, too!
