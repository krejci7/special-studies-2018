I think many of  us feel that we have two sides and that out two sides are very different from each other.  Sometimes I have a hard time believing that both my male persona and Hannah are the same physical being.  We are two souls in one body, in a way.  There is overlap of course, but I feel there are parts of me that come out depending on the gender I present at on any given day. I couldn’t help but think about this as I read about Nancy Clench and Nathan Sparling.  In male mode, Nathan is one of the Scottish National Party’s most trusted senior political advisers.  As Nancy, she is one of London’s most beloved drag queens.  As Hannah, I feel pretty fearless but I can’t imagine what it would be like to be so out and open in both of my genders.  I keep both sides of me pretty separated, probably less than three people know “me” and Hannah.
