These extended weekend gatherings are designed as purely social events open to all crossdressers, transexuals, admirers, and allies. Participants include visitors from NYC, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, Saint Louis, Milwaukee, Chicago, Indianapolis, Toronto, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Columbus, Toledo, West Virginia and more, as well as drawing extensively from the large and very active local Detroit and greater Michigan TG community.  We are lucky to have Nicole share her adventures and pictures. Enjoy.  Love, Hannah  I was offered the opportunity to share my most recent travel adventure here. \u00a0I accepted. I recently viewed a video of comedian/actor Will Smith talking about fears. He was talking about jumping out of an airplane, not himself specifically, but just \u201ca guy\u201d who agreed with friends to do this fearful act. Why couldn\u2019t this guy sleep the night before the jump? \u00a0He was nowhere near an airplane yet. \u00a0Why was he afraid when he arrived at the airport to meet his friends. \u00a0They weren\u2019t in the airplane yet. Then following the jump, the guy was in a state of euphoria. \u00a0I can equate this to my personal history with being a t-girl. I was in the closet. Why was I so scared of \u201cjumping\u201d out the door? \u00a0And once I did step out the door\u2026euphoria. The basic message. \u00a0Bliss comes on the other side of our biggest fears. So, now, not only do I go out, but I, as Nicole, started traveling.  My travels always start with planning. \u00a0Since I don\u2019t travel for business, it\u2019s my personal vacation time being used. \u00a0I start a couple months ahead of time by notifying a few friends that I am coming their way and hopefully we will have an opportunity to get together. My most recent travels took me to Chicago and Detroit.  I left the Twin Cities on Tuesday, April 18, 2017. \u00a0Why a Tuesday, especially the third Tuesday. Well, after my six hour drive to the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights,IL, I checked in to my hotel, notified my friends that I had arrived, and started doing my makeup. We\u2019re going out. There is a woman, Rori, owner of Transformations By Rori, who hosts a t-party on the third Tuesday of every month. It\u2019s at mainstream Big Shot piano bar. \u00a0I have attended at least six times, maybe a couple more. During the evening, there can be 15-30 t-girls come and go, or stay for the duration. \u00a0There\u2019s dinner available, cocktails, and a wonderful piano player for entertainment. \u00a0It\u2019s a wonderful social opportunity for girls to meet and get to know other girls.   Wednesday I moved southward. \u00a0I had a hotel room in Alsip, IL, an hour from Arlington Heights. \u00a0This made my trip to see girlfriends at Club Krave, a small corner bar in Blue Island, IL, a short drive. While the bar may be small, the hearts of the girls who frequent it aren\u2019t. \u00a0They welcome me as if I were one of the regulars. \u00a0Wednesday night is karaoke night at Krave, so there tend to be 6-12 girls singing any given week. I don\u2019t sing myself, but having met the girls at Club Krave makes me smile.  \u00a0 \u00a0  Two nights down. \u00a0Still more fun to be had. \u00a0Thursday morning, April 20, I applied my makeup, put on a dress and drove four hours from Alsip, to Dearborn, Michigan. \u00a0I had registered to participate for a second time in Detroit Invasion(www.tgdetroit.com). \u00a0Invasion is a three night social gathering that is held four times a year. \u00a0Don\u2019t confuse this with any transgender conference event. \u00a0This one is pure social time\u2026ok, it\u2019s a party, lol. \u00a0What it really is, is an experience. Ladies from all over attend\u2026Detroit locals, outstate Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, Wisconsin,and of course Minnesota(me, lol). And Canada too.   I had the pleasure of sharing a hotel room with Stephanie, a girl from Cincinnati, OH. \u00a0She and I had met twice previously. The first time I met Stephanie was when she visited the Twin Cities for business. \u00a0She found me on Facebook, asking if there were places where a girl could go out. Not only did I say yes there are, but she allowed me to join her and show her.\u00a0 Coincidentally, the first thing we did was enjoy a dinner out with Hannah\u2019s MN T-Girls.   First night in Detroit was a meet and greet at a LGBT bar named Adam\u2019s Apple. It\u2019s the starting point for all three nights. Approximately 20 of us then went to dinner at a lovely restaurant called Big Fish. \u00a0Delicious! \u00a0We then returned to Adam\u2019s Apple for the remainder of the evening.     Friday was a relaxing day. Stephanie and I, along with a third friend, Jamie, went to lunch at a fabulous place called Rosie O\u2019Grady\u2019s. \u00a0I love it. \u00a0Two trips to Detroit, three meals at Rosie\u2019s, lol. After that, we did a little shopping, including a stop at Janet\u2019s Closet, \u201ca crossdresser\u2019s paradise.\u201d  Friday night\u2019s main event was a pub crawl. \u00a0After congregating at the Adam\u2019s Apple, we boarded a bus and made three stops. First was The Whitney, a historical lumber baron mansion turned into a restaurant and bar. A classy place where we were fortunate that they could accommodate a group our size. \u00a0We then stopped in an alley. \u00a0What? \u00a0Yes, basically it was an alley. Cool place though. \u00a0Numerous small venues\u2026bars and eateries. We stopped at two bars along there for cocktails.The final stop of the crawl was in Ferndale. \u00a0There are multiple clubs/bars in that area within walking distance of the drop point. \u00a0I spent my time with numerous friends at Orchid, a dance club. Enjoyed a few cocktails and even danced.  The daytime on Saturday was very low key, casual. \u00a0Lingered around the hotel lobby a bit. \u00a0Stephanie and I then went to a TGIFriday\u2019s for lunch. A small group of girls went to the Henry Ford Museum compound. \u00a0While I didn\u2019t go, I did hear that it is a excellent place to check out.    Saturday night\u2019s main event was a bus trip to the MGM Grand Casino in Detroit. It\u2019s the grand finale of the weekend. \u00a0Once through security, we all make our way, parading towards the lounge in the center of the casino as one large group. \u00a0I\u2019ve never seen so many heads turn, especially by people who are gambling. \u00a0But a minute later, they are all back to doing their thing and we are doing ours, which is enjoying the live band in the lounge and dancing.  Sunday morning, it was breakfast and goodbyes. \u00a0One girl was having difficulties getting a taxi or Uber to the bar, where she had left her vehicle the previous night. I gave her a ride to get the vehicle, then headed back to Chicago, where I spent one more night before returning to Minnesota.  1448 miles later, I was home again, needing a vacation from my vacation. \u00a0Seven days, six nights traveling as Nicole, seeing old friends and making new friends. And missing my local friends. \u00a0What could be better? \u00a0Not much in my view. \u00a0This is one trip, one view. \u00a0But as you read this, I hope you understand something\u2026I was not alone. \u00a0YOU are not alone. \u00a0Our community doesn\u2019t exist just here or just there. \u00a0There are girls like us, friends to be made, all around the globe. \u00a0This was just two cities, yet one community.    Hugs to all,  Nicole Spencer", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
