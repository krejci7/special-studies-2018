As  t-girl, I pay a lot of attention to the issue regarding bathroom use, which seems like such a silly thing to worry about and pass laws about.  I’ve written about it and I try to stay up to date about different state laws.  The law is not just about bathroom use, it’s about how the public sees us.  I think many people push this in an effort to create fear about our community. This recent article on NPR discusses how the Supreme Court will hear a case on transgender students and using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity.
