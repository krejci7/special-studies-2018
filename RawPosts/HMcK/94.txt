As a member of the trans community, I am worried about us.\u00a0 It\u2019s no secret that the current vice-president is very anti-LGBT and I worry about our rights being taken, I worry about attacks on our community.\u00a0 The first time I went out after the election I felt an apprehension I hadn\u2019t felt since the first time I left the house years ago.\u00a0 Fortunately it was a MN T-Girls event and one of the reasons I founded the group was the belief of safety in numbers, or, I suppose, we are stronger together.\u00a0  In the times I\u2019ve been out since the election, I\u2019ve braced myself for\u2026something.\u00a0 But so far there hasn\u2019t been any incidents.\u00a0 In fact, it has seemed a little more positive than usual.\u00a0 The MN T-Girls event in November was dinner at a wonderful restaurant and as we discussed the election and our fears, a group of cis-women approached our table and let us know how happy they were to see us.\u00a0 I was so happy to hear to hear that.\u00a0 I thought by being out in public was, in a way, an act of defiance of the new administration.\u00a0 They might hate us, they might want to pass laws against us, but we are not going back into the closet.\u00a0 I can\u2019t go back in the closet, between all my dresses and heels there is no room for me.\u00a0 It was also wonderful to hear support from\u2026anyone. Having fun but also watching my back The most recent time I was out was also for a MN T-Girls event where we went shopping downtown.\u00a0 This was a fun afternoon and I struck up a conversation with another woman who was shopping.\u00a0 As I browsed the racks she mistook me for a sales clerk and we started to chat about\u2026well, clothes, of course.\u00a0 I loved this little conversation because it was initiated by her.\u00a0 I have no doubt in my mind she knew I was (and still am, I suppose) transgender but she spoke to me anyway.\u00a0 I know that sounds silly but I wonder if anyone avoids making conversation with me because of who I am.\u00a0 If they do, this woman did not.\u00a0 It was a fun day and I was happy that the day passed without incident. However, I still wait for something.\u00a0 I fully believe that people who are anti-trans, racist and sexist feel emboldened now that we have a president and administration who has a track record of these traits as executive orders such as the immigration ban are signed into law.\u00a0 I live in a very liberal city in a state that voted for Hillary Clinton (or against Trump in some cases) but so many of us live in towns and states that went the other way. Have you experienced any change in people\u2019s attitude since the election?", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
