I am passable and I have a female friend (We grew up next door to each other and are only children) so she is like a sister to me. She has asked to be maid of honor in her wedding next summer. However she wants me to begin immediately living full time as a female so I am prepared for all the wedding stuff. She has offered a place to live and a job what do I do. Thanks. I receive a lot of emails and from time to time I get a message along the lines of \u201c\u2026my wife\u2019s best friend moved away and she misses having someone to go shopping with.\u00a0 Now my wife wants me to live as a woman so she has a girlfriend again.\u00a0 What should I do?\u201d\u00a0 My suspicion is that many of those messages are fake.\u00a0 I think there are some crossdressers who are\u2026intrigued, let\u2019s call it, at the idea of someone else taking charge of their gender identity.\u00a0 Perhaps there are those who want to dress/transition but taking comfort in the idea that it was the idea of someone else.\u00a0 I am not sure, I cannot answer that question.\u00a0 When I was in my teens I read anything I could about crossdressing and for a few of us, this is a fetish, fantasy or a sexual turn on.\u00a0 There is a lot of fiction written about someone being crossdressed by someone else.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a girl but my aunt is making me dress up\u201d or \u201cI lost a bet and now I have to be a cheerleader\u201d are popular themes. I never was a fan of not being able to make your own decisions about who you are or what you wear.\u00a0 For some, the above question is the ultimate fantasy.\u00a0 Someone supportive in our lives, the chance of being a maid of honor and the offer of living full time as a woman.\u00a0 I\u2019m not one to say what fantasies one is allowed to have.\u00a0 That\u2019s the point, they are YOUR fantasies.\u00a0 I am also not questioning the legitimacy of this email, either. My point is that your gender identity is YOUR gender identity.\u00a0 It is your decision and not one that can be maid by anyone else.\u00a0 It is entirely up to you if you want to transition, dress up for a day, a month, a year or forever.\u00a0 Please don\u2019t let anyone make this decision for you.\u00a0 Living full-time is a drastic life change and not a choice one should make at someone\u2019s else request, nor should it be made lightly. I would encourage you to seek out a gender counselor or therapist, join a support group, talk with your doctor and loved ones to determine if this is truly the direction you wish to go. Best of luck!
