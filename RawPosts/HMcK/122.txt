It\u2019s hard to come out to someone when you aren\u2019t exactly sure who you are.\u00a0 Being who we are is very simple and very complicated at the same time.\u00a0 Some of us need a lifetime to feel at peace with who we are, to be able tell ourselves who are are.\u00a0 Telling someone else is almost exhausting.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard enough for us to understand who we are, but it\u2019s even harder for someone else to understand, or accept us. I hope you all have someone in your life you can beyourself with, someone you can honest about yourself with.\u00a0 Ours is a lonely, beautiful life.
