The MN T-Girls started in November 2013 and I cannot believe how much time has passed and how many fabulous adventures we’ve had.  We can’t let such an important anniversary pass without a party, so last night we celebrated in style at one of the nicest restaurants in Saint Paul, the wonderful Pazzaluna. It was a small group, just five of us and it was really nice to put on a little black dress, eat yummy food and talk about…the election.  I know we’ve all had our share of the election right now, but just as the last few years have had an impact on the transgender community, the next few years, and beyond, will likely be the same.  As t-girls we all have concerns and fears and to be be honest, it was really nice to be able to share those same frustrations and encourage each other during such a difficult week. Of course, we also talked about all the other things t-girls talk about…clothes and make up.     I was a little…unsure of how the night would go as it was the first time I’ve been out since the election, and with stories against the GLBT community in the news, I was a little apprehensive.  Thankfully it as a wonderful night.  I had more smiles and small talk than I usually do and a very nice group of cis-women stopped by our table and told us how happy she was to see a group like ours.  We all sat and just beamed in her kindness. I am not sure what the next year in the MN T-Girls will bring or what the next four years in the country will bring, but for one wonderful night, everyone seemed happy to see us. Love, Hannah
