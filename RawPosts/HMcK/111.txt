I think interacting with kids have been the most surprising.\u00a0 When I do see kids, they do stare at me.\u00a0 But when I smile at them, they smile back.\u00a0 I do wonder what this generation will be like as they get older since transgender men and women are in the news, entertainment and even children\u2019s books.\u00a0 Society is normalizing being transgender to this generation.\u00a0 I think shows like SheZow are a step in the right direction. Explaining what being transgender is can be hard and easy at the same time, and explaining things to kids is a different type of easy and hard.\u00a0 I wanted to share a post on Huffinging Post that featured some great resources for talking to kids about what being transgender means.
