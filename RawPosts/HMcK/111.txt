I love seeing support for our community from people and organizations that are not transgender.\u00a0 My wife sent me a link that shows support for us but also a way that we can identify allies who will go with us, meaning they will visit the ladies room with us in case there\u2019s trouble.\u00a0 In all the years I\u2019ve been using the ladies room I\u2019ve never had an issue but I doubt things will be safer for us over the next few years. This might also be a good time to remind everyone of Refugee Restrooms, a website that lists safe restrooms for the transcommunity.\u00a0 It wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to download their app for when you\u2019re out and about. Stay safe.\u00a0 And fabulous. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
