I\u2019m always looking for a fun experience and this opportunity seemed too fun to pass up.\u00a0 I\u2019m waaay too shy to do anything in a boudoir style, but who can resist the fun, flirty dresses of a pinup girl? Before the visit, I had a makeover with the incredibly talented Corrie Dupay of Midwest Makeup Supply.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been blessed to know Corrie for a little more than a year now and even had a makeup lesson with her recently.\u00a0 She always does *amazing* work, but this makeover was dynamite.  When I walked into Christie\u2019s studio, I was blown away by how\u2026cool it was.\u00a0 It felt like I was stepping back in time as I was surrounded by vintage furniture and props.  I was impressed with the wardrobe options, of course.\u00a0 What t-girl wouldn\u2019t be?  The shoe selection was to die for.  Christi is also ready to provide hair styling.  After picking out a couple outfits, Christi and I got to work.\u00a0 She helped me pose, showed me where to point my toes, how to position my hand and kept things light, fun and playful.\u00a0 After we were done shooting, we sat down and looked over her work and picked out the best photos.  Once the photos were picked, Christi and I sat and chatter about beauty, fashion and of course, the transcommunity.\u00a0 Christi works with a lot of transgender clients and does some remarkable work.\u00a0 She does gender transformations and I can absolutely testify to her talent and support. I am dying to see the final photos and I will post them when I have them.\u00a0 Until then, I hope you enjoy this preview.  Thank you to Christi for an unforgettable shoot.\u00a0 If you\u2019d like to experience this yourself, drop her a line. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Hannah McKnight"}
