Today was the monthly MN T-Girls outing and we had an amazing time as we held our annual photo shoot.   This was the third year that we were treated to such an incredible day thanks to Shannonlee of Fotodia Studios.   I have been working with Shannonlee for a few years now and she is always just wonderful to work with.  There were a total of six of us getting our portraits taken.  We had a lot of wardrobe changes and the day was filled with the sound of high heels clicking on hardwood floors.  It was a day none of us will forget anytime soon.  Thanks to Shannonlee for such a perfect day.   Love, Hannah
