It was a small group, just five of us and it was really nice to put on a little black dress, eat yummy food and talk about\u2026the election.\u00a0 I know we\u2019ve all had our share of the election right now, but just as the last few years have had an impact on the transgender community, the next few years, and beyond, will likely be the same.\u00a0 As t-girls we all have concerns and fears and to be be honest, it was really nice to be able to share those same frustrations and encourage each other during such a difficult week. Of course, we also talked about all the other things t-girls talk about\u2026clothes and make up.\u00a0    I was a little\u2026unsure of how the night would go as it was the first time I\u2019ve been out since the election, and with stories against the GLBT community in the news, I was a little apprehensive.\u00a0 Thankfully it as a wonderful night.\u00a0 I had more smiles and small talk than I usually do and a very nice group of cis-women stopped by our table and told us how happy she was to see a group like ours.\u00a0 We all sat and just beamed in her kindness. I am not sure what the next year in the MN T-Girls will bring or what the next four years in the country will bring, but for one wonderful night, everyone seemed happy to see us.
