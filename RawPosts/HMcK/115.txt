Since only a small few of us t-girls can truly pass I think it\u2019s imperative to then master the finer things to near perfection. I think it\u2019s more thrilling to be in public with your hair and makeup on point and your clothes and accessories to be age and environment appropriate causing a stranger or passer by to either not notice or simply nod with appreciation for looking good and \u201cplaying\u201d the part.   Now you are much more public and accomplished than I\u2019ll ever be, so I\u2019d love for you to share your point of view.  Thank you. I\u2019ve written a little about what I call \u2018the myth of passing\u2019 and the older I get and the more I dress, the more I stand by it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think passing is something that is realistic for any of us.\u00a0 I think if I waited until I thought I passed I\u2019d still be sitting in my car in my garage.\u00a0 Of course, I would have missed out on so many amazing experiences that I\u2019ve had.\u00a0 I sometimes wonder what I missed in all those years before I was confident enough to go out. Look at this picture.\u00a0 Do I \u201cpass\u201d?  It doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 I love you all, but it really doesn\u2019t matter to me if you think I pass or not.\u00a0 I look at the picture and I see ME.\u00a0 I remember the day it was taken.\u00a0 It was a Saturday in July, I spent the day at the Mall of America wearing my new dress.\u00a0 I found an amazing new outfit, spent too much on makeup and bought a pair of black heels. Looking in the mirror, I know my shoulders are broader than most cis-women, I know my hands are larger, too.\u00a0 But that doesn\u2019t mean women, trans or cis have to have hands of a certain size.\u00a0 I\u2019ve seen women basketball players that are taller than me in my stilettos.\u00a0 And I have tall stilettos. What got me out of my room, my house, my car, my garage all those years ago was a complete and unshakeable confidence in myself and the undying desire to experience the world in a way I always wanted.\u00a0 I wanted to feel the wind through my long hair, to hear the click of my heels in the mall, I wanted to see my lipstick on the lid of a Starbucks cup.\u00a0 I did it and I\u2019ve never looked back. I love looking my best.\u00a0 I know I am likely the most overdressed person in the room, the store or the entire mall.\u00a0 You\u2019re right, it is a thrill to be out with the perfect necklace and accessories and heels to match my dress. People stare, people take a second look, people say wonderful things, people smile sincerely, people compliment\u2026and that\u2019s all okay.\u00a0 Even the smirkers.\u00a0 People look at me as if they\u2019re seeing a transperson for the first time\u2026because there is a good chance they are.\u00a0 I know I am representing the transcommunity and I want to look my best for us. It\u2019s okay if people think you\u2019re trans.\u00a0 And really, you\u2019ll never, EVER know what people think of you unless you ask them. I never see what I do as \u201cplaying the part\u201d.\u00a0 I simply am who I am. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
