It doesn’t seem that long ago when I thought I was the only boy who wanted to wear makeup, but 2017 is off to a groundbreaking start when it comes to de-genderinzing cosmetics. De-genderizing?  Is that a word?  It is now. First up, from Buzzfeed, Maybelline Just Hired A Guy To Be The Face Of Its New Mascara.   MAC also has just released their new Caitlyn Jenner line of makeup.  See the entire line here.  Love, Hannah
