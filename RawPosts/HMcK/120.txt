The day started off with a makeover with Ulta and after that, the fun really got started.\u00a0 There were a total of five of us getting our photos professionally taken.\u00a0 Many pictures were taken, many outfits were worn and our faces hurt from all the smiling. It was an amazing day and I can\u2019t wait to see the final pictures!\u00a0 Until then, enjoy some behind the scenes fun. Love, Hannah", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
