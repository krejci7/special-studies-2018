I couldn\u2019t help but think about this as I read about Nancy Clench and Nathan Sparling.\u00a0 In male mode, Nathan is one of the Scottish National Party\u2019s most trusted senior political advisers.\u00a0 As Nancy, she is one of London\u2019s most beloved drag queens.  As Hannah, I feel pretty fearless but I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to be so out and open in both of my genders.\u00a0 I keep both sides of me pretty separated, probably less than three people know \u201cme\u201d and Hannah.
