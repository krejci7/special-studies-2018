From the Minneapolis Star Tribune: Group will advise the City Council and Park Board on issues such as disparities, employment and access. Minneapolis city leaders created an official group Friday to advise the City Council and Park Board on matters related to the transgender community. The new Transgender Equity Council is part of an ongoing city effort to identify disparities and work more closely with community members. The city launched an annual Trans Equity Summit in 2014 and formed a transgender issues work group that same year. The council established Friday will continue that work but be subject to the city’s open appointment process and open meeting laws, said Council Member Elizabeth Glidden, who sponsored the measure.
