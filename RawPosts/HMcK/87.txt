Our names are important.\u00a0 They have power, they give us power.\u00a0 Usually our names are something we chose.\u00a0 Sometimes they are the names we would have been given had we were identified as female at birth. Sometimes someone else gives them to us.\u00a0 But the power comes from us having a name, a real name to this side of us that is usually a secret to almost everyone else in our lives. It\u2019s funny, when I talk to other t-girls, we chat about shoes, makeup, shopping\u2026but we also talk about deeper things, like our family, whether or not this side of us works in our relationships, or politics.\u00a0 But our names are rarely discussed.\u00a0 How did you get yours?
