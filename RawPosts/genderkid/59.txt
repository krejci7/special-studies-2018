At first I was really excited, but I haven\u2019t been doing much for some time now. That\u2019s partly due to the difficulty of doing trans activism in a mostly lesbian and gay group, but I\u2019ll write more on that later. Right now, I\u2019m feeling tired and down and I just want to rant a little. Where do you get your strength when it takes every ounce of energy you can muster to hold up your sense of self every day, only to have it trampled by people who can\u2019t \u2014who won\u2019t\u2014 even see who you are? When every single day you have to rebuild yourself from the ashes of a girl who is no longer there? Where do you find the strength, even if you\u2019re surrounded by people who loved you as a girl, when only a handful of them support you as the boy you are? Sometimes I lower my standards. I say to myself, you\u2019re lucky to have gotten this far alive; you\u2019re lucky to be able to get up every morning; you know people who couldn\u2019t stand the pressure. You don\u2019t have to push yourself any further. But if I don\u2019t push myself, if I can\u2019t even stand up for myself and claim my rights, who is going to do it for me? What right do I have to feel tired already when there are so many people living in much worse conditions than I am? How can you stand up for your rights when just standing up is so damn draining? Where do you find the strength?", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 genderkid"}
