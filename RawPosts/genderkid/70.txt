I knew someone who was going to that class and he said I could probably slip in \u2014 which would be really lucky, because only 50 or 60 people were actually allowed to sign up. I spent the whole week in a dizzy disbelief: could it really be so easy to see such a legend? Yesterday afternoon I was walking down the street when I crossed someone familiar. Then it struck me: it was her! The real live Judith Butler! I said hello and thanked her for her work \u2013very quickly, because I didn\u2019t want to bother her too much\u2013 and she offered me her hand to shake. A day later, I think I\u2019m still in shock. Later on I went to the college were the class was going to be held. I still didn\u2019t know if I was going to be able to attend \u2013I only sort-of had permission\u2013 but it was completely worth trying; and I ended up being allowed in. I thought I wouldn\u2019t understand anything she said, but she explained her ideas very clearly. Plus, she was very funny at times. I\u2019m glad I had the chance to hear her talking about gender, considering her latest work is about other subjects. Despite all the academic language, and despite being familiar with the main points of her work, some parts of her talk gave me goosebumps: I recognized much of my own life in what she said. I\u2019m very grateful to everyone who writes about gender in ways that allowed me to free my mind. I\u2019m not exactly sure whose ideas I agree with yet; I\u2019m young and I have a lot to read and learn and experience. But I thank everyone who helped me see beyond the binary, and it was nice to see one of those people.", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 genderkid"}
