I think I\u2019m finally in a situation where I can advance lgbt issues -especially trans issues- at my secondary school. Around April, a couple of kids and I founded a Diversity Commission within the Student Center. We didn\u2019t do much throughout the year, but last week \u2013which happened to be the last schoolweek of this schoolyear\u2013 was HUGE. My school hosted a weekful of queer activities, including an art festival, music, plays, workshops, presentations, tons of stuff. It\u2019s the first time something this big and queer takes place in a school. Several journalists and photographers came to see and ask questions. I gave a speech which I\u2019ll post later. It was all organized by Argentina\u2019s two most important LGBTQIA organizations \u2013working separately\u2013 and we, from the Diversity Commission, planned some stuff too. But most importantly, lots of students were interested. Some even want to work with the Diversity Commission in the future. I really hope the visibility helps young people who are questioning or insecure.  Next year, if everything goes well, we\u2019ll seriously change the school atmosphere. On the cultural/social level, we\u2019re planning on student art expos and maybe a few large, conceptual art installations. On the institutional/political level, I want to push inclusive sex ed. This year, the Student Center managed to make sex ed mandatory within Health class; we need to make sure that kids learn to protect themselves with same-sex partners (at the very least) and that they understand non-heteronormative genders and sexualities (which would be ideal). And now, for my most cherished project: I want trans students to be able to use their chosen names. The University of Buenos Aires (UBA) already has a nice system we could adopt, where the chosen name is associated to the legal name; but only the chosen name appears on teacher\u2019s lists and stuff. If the principal totally rejects the idea, an lgbt organization already offered their legal support. I just hope that, by then, I also have my parents\u2019 support.", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 genderkid"}
