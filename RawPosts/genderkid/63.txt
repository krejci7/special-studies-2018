She started out by asking if my legal name bothered me, and was really surprised when I said that it does bug me a LOT. I was relieved that she asked: recently I\u2019ve been dreading school, even if I do love certain classes, because it\u2019s so tiresome to be called, over and over again, by a name that doesn\u2019t fit (except by my friends, who try to respect my name and pronouns). I think all my classmates know that I\u2019m trans, but they probably don\u2019t understand what that even means; I imagine that they think of me as a weird faggysuperbutch dyke with a \u201cspecial\u201d name she likes to call herself. True, I\u2019ve never spoken directly to them about my identity; I felt stuck in a limbo where it didn\u2019t make sense to come out \u2013everyone already knew\u2013 but I wasn\u2019t out enough to improve my life, either. There were another two classmates present during my conversation with Q, and one of them promised to call me by my male name; she hadn\u2019t realized that my female name hurt me (the other person pretended he wasn\u2019t there; it was a pretty awkward situation). Maybe I could have gotten out of that limbo earlier had I told people directly that I was changing my name, but I don\u2019t know how I would have done it. It\u2019s hard to deal with people who aren\u2019t exactly friends, but with whom you interact daily. Then the conversation turned towards inappropiate and intrusive areas. \u201cYou like girls, right?\u201d \u201cDo you want to get surgery?\u201d \u201cAre you like those men who are born with boobs and girl parts?\u201d \u2014 I answered \u201cyes\u201d to this at first but then I realized she wanted to know if I was intersex; although she didn\u2019t actually know that word. And I know that some cis men develop breasts, but I doubt they are BORN with them. I was caught off guard so I answered kind of incoherently. I feel a little frustrated because I tried to explain things in a way she could relate to instead of telling her that, in my opinion, body doesn\u2019t determine gender (or vice versa). I know it isn\u2019t my obligation to teach cis people about trans issues, but sometimes I like trying to open someone\u2019s mind to another point of view. I also wish I had retorted something like \u201cdo you like girls? do you want surgery? are you hitting on me?\u201d I am improving in the way I handle this kind of situation. I managed to deflect these questions somewhat, instead of answering personally: I said that who you are is different from who you\u2019re attracted to, and that some trans people want surgery but not all of them, and that it\u2019s a tough decision. Now that I think about it, I\u2019m happy with how I reacted, given the surprise situation; and I think I\u2019ll be more prepared next time. And I hope people at school start respecting my identity.", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 genderkid"}
