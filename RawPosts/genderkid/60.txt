This emerging, abiding sway includes both \u201cbecoming\u201d as well as \u201cBeing\u201d in the narrower sense of fixed continuity. Phusis is the event of standing forth, arising from the concealed and thus enabling the concealed to take its stand for the first time. \u2013Heidegger, Introduction to Metaphysics, chapter 1. God, that\u2019s stunning. I think it\u2019s a beautiful way to describe emerging identity; becoming who you feel you are. There\u2019s something about the idea of standing forth that feels empowering: \u201chere I am, this is who I want to be, and now I want you to see that\u201d. Personally, I\u2019d rather not exist in a state of \u201cfixed continuity\u201d, but the word \u201csway\u201d sounds pleasantly fluid. I know Heidegger didn\u2019t mean any of this, but this is how he made me feel. When I reached this part of the book, I got goosebumps.", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 genderkid"}
