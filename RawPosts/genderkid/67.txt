There is a lot of new trans-related legislation, but the laws that apply to trans students aren\u2019t valid in my city, and the ones that do belong to my city aren\u2019t specifically about schools. Actually, there is one very important law that I could use, which refers to underage trans students, but I couldn\u2019t find much information about it; I think I\u2019ll need a lawyer\u2019s help. The principal also wants my parents\u2019 consent, which I\u2019m not sure I can get. I\u2019ll try, but I don\u2019t think it should be necessary; I\u2019ll be 18, after all, and even if my parents have some power over me until I\u2019m 21 (depending on the situation), my well-being at school should be more important. In the meantime, I\u2019ve been signing my letters to the principal with my male name, asking for permission to organize queer activities, and she\u2019s been sending me the permissions with my female name. It makes sense because the bureaucracy wouldn\u2019t find my male self in the system, but I\u2019m going to continue signing that way. A few weeks ago I signed up for a career counseling group at school using my female name; I knew they would check to see if I existed in the system and I was afraid the school might call my parents if they realized what was going on. This group started today, but I really did not want to go voluntarily to a place where I would be called by my birth name. Until the last minute, though, I hadn\u2019t decided whether to go or not: it could prove very useful, and it wasn\u2019t fair that I couldn\u2019t go because my identity. The friends that were present at that moment did not understand why I made such a big deal out of this; one of them argued that she didn\u2019t like her middle name either, but she didn\u2019t fuss so much about it. I sincerely told her that if her name bothered her so much, she should change it too. The point isn\u2019t to compare our sufferings; that doesn\u2019t lead anywhere. I believe we should all aim to be as happy as possible, no matter how small or large our complaints. I\u2019m tired of hearing that worrying over names is silly. I\u2019m sick of internalizing the feeling that it\u2019s foolish to care so much about a minor detail. It is not minor, nor a detail: I heard a trans woman talk about friends of hers, also trans, who wouldn\u2019t go to the hospital until they were very sick, in order to avoid the humiliation of being called by their birth names; not to mention the discrimination they suffered (there are laws now that protect trans people in public hospitals). No one would risk their life like that if it weren\u2019t so painful and violent to be called by the wrong name. I ended up going to the career counseling group; it was awful. I decided that my Whole Future was worth being treated as female for an hour, but I hadn\u2019t considered that we would have to introduce ourselves; when it was my turn, I got defensive and probably sounded hostile (oops) when I said I would rather not introduce myself. The counselor was not comprehensive at all and finally forced me to say my name; I couldn\u2019t flee without making a scene. I wanted to run to the bathroom to cry while she went on and on about having to use your name whether you like it or not, especially within institutions where it\u2019s legally needed. I obviously won\u2019t ever go back, but I still think that\u2019s unfair. And I\u2019m more certain than ever that names are not foolish at all.", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 genderkid"}
