They were so disappointed when I gradually cut my hair and started wearing \u201cmen\u2019s\u201d clothes: I had a really hard time doing those things because I knew they suffered. For a long time, my mom looked at me as if I had a terminal illness, except right before haircuts \u2014 then she couldn\u2019t look at me at all. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined their reaction! When my dad found my letter, he woke me up just to tell me that he loved me very much and that he\u2019d deal with my mom. He showed her the letter today, and they both came to tell me that they had imagined many of the feelings I had written about, and that they just needed time to adjust. Neither of them feel ready to use my chosen name, but that\u2019s fine by me; it would feel weird, anyway. I\u2019m partly relieved and partly wary \u2014 it\u2019s hard to believe that they aren\u2019t going to confront me at all. But I\u2019m trying to wave those concerns away, because even if I do meet resistance in the future \u2013when I start T, for instance\u2013 it\u2019s useless to worry right now. In any case I know that I\u2019m immensely privileged to have gotten such a warm response. I just wish it could be this way for everyone. This whole experience goes to show that people\u2019s reactions really can\u2019t be predicted. I had read about cases like this, where open-minded parents respond badly or viceversa, but for me, the lesson only sank in through experience.", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 genderkid"}
