I bet you know that he was the first openly gay person to be elected to a public office; that he was murdered by Dan White, fellow supervisor; that White only recieved 5 years in prison; that 3000 people rioted protesting such an unfair sentence. Maybe you\u2019ve heard what he said shortly before dying: \u201cIf a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door.\u201d Tomorrow, it will be thirty years since Harvey Milk died. But his spirit is alive among us, whether we are gay and/or trans. What moves me most about Harvey Milk are his own words. Just listen to this from his own mouth:   Somewhere\u2026 there is a young gay person who suddenly realizes that he or she is gay; knows that if the parents find out, they\u2019d be tossed out of the house; the classmates would torture the child; and the Anita Bryants and John Briggs are doing their bit on TV. That child has several options: staying in the closet, suicide. And then one day that child might open up the paper and it says \u201cHomosexual voted to San Francisco\u201d and there are two new options. Option is to go to California, or stay in San Antonio and fight. That last part really gets to me. Because I know that, in Argentina, I don\u2019t have too many rights as a transgender person. I know that my daily life might be easier someplace else, where people know and understand trans issues. But after listening to Harvey Milk, how could I just leave, how could I abandon all my trans brothersisters, with a clean conscience? I think I have to stay here, and fight. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Rest of the speech (sorry if I transcribed anything incorrectly): Two days after I was elected I got a phone call; the voice was quite young. It was from Altoona, Pennsylvania and the person said: thanks. And you\u2019ve got to elect gay people, so that that young child, and the thousands and thousands like that child, know that there\u2019s hope for a better world; there\u2019s hope for a better tomorrow. Without hope, not only gays, but those Blacks, and the Asians, the disabled, the seniors, the us\u2019s, the us\u2019s; without hope, the us\u2019s give up. I know that you cannot live on hope alone; but without it, life is not worth living. And you, and you, and you, gotta give them hope. Whoa, Harvey Milk\u2019s words are powerful. You can read some more fragments of speeches at Wikipedia. Also, check out the trailer of the Milk movie. \u201cHis life changed history. His courage changed lives.\u201d Thanks to LesbianDad for the video.", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 genderkid"}
