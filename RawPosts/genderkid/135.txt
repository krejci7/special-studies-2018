First of all, I\u2019m a Latin American living in Latin America. The beauty of the blogosphere is that I can live over here, and you can live way over there, but we can still connect through our words. I\u2019m still in high school and living with my parents. So, I have no idea whether my gender doubts are about identity or about raging hormones (or maybe hormones are a part of identity? Tough question). I\u2019ve been questioning my gender, on and off, for two years; I just didn\u2019t think too much about the matter because I was discovering my queer sexuality at the same time. Plus, it was plain scary. But I can\u2019t ignore my gender identity anymore. For months I\u2019ve been combing the internet for news articles, academic papers, websites, movies, whatever, on the subject. Then I found a blog on gender by a genderqueer person. And you know how it is: from the blogroll you find a related blog, and the people who comments also have interesting blogs, and soon there\u2019s no going back. It makes you want your own blog to participate in the debate. So voil\u00e0.", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 genderkid"}
