I only became fully aware of the consequences today, at a \u201chow to sign up for college\u201d information session. I thought I wouldn\u2019t have to sign up until next year; as it turns out, registration is next MONTH. So I have to figure out, pronto, how to get signed up with my correct name. I chose a college which, according to many word-of-mouth sources, has a \u201cpreferred name\u201d system for trans students. However, I haven\u2019t found any documents confirming that. Even if it is true, the person in charge of enrollment might not be aware of that, so I should be prepared. I tried calling several information numbers, unsuccessfully, and I sent emails to three different info addresses. If all fails, I\u2019ll try going in person. I\u2019ve chosen to stay at my school for an extra year to do introductory college-level courses\u00a0 \u2013allowing me to skip a whole year at the university\u2013 which is why I thought I wouldn\u2019t have to sign up at college yet. I do, though, and on top of that I still have to persuade the secondary-school principal to accept my preferred name.\u00a0 The good thing is, if I manage to change my name at school but not at the university, it won\u2019t be a big deal \u2014 I\u2019ll have an extra year to work with that. In any case, I have to come out to my parents soon. I promised myself that I\u2019d talk to them right after graduating, so I can move forward with my life a bit. I\u2019d like to start testosterone next year and actively research chest surgeons: I thought a lot about this, and I want both. Since graduation dates got pushed far into November, my coming out plans fall dangerously close to Christmas. I don\u2019t want to postpone this indefinitely \u2013even though it\u2019s the VERY SCARIEST thing I\u2019ve ever done\u2013 so I might talk to them before ending school. I don\u2019t want to ruin my graduation, but it might be best to it during the school year so I have something to distract me for most of every day. I hadn\u2019t decided on this before typing this post, so I\u2019m feeling pretty shaken now. But I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m finally going confront my greatest fear. In Spanish, it\u2019s called \u201chuir hacia delante\u201d: fleeing forward. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next, but at least I\u2019m going to be moving somewhere.", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 genderkid"}
