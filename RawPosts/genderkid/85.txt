Genders in everyday life Names high school name School secondary school teachers teen teenage teenaged teenager trans transboy transgender 
I know two transboys who have “exotic” legal (girl) names, so people just assume they’re boys with uncommon names. I don’t want to mention their actual names, but take the name Andrea: it’s mostly used for women, but in Italy it’s a boy name. I know a cisgender guy named Andrea. My legal name isn’t that versatile: it’s kind of like Emily or Sarah, Juana or Daniela. I wonder if people would still believe me if I told them it’s a rare boy name. I don’t mean to keep my old name, but it’s still on my ID and on teachers’ lists at school; I’d like to avoid being outed all the time. Some people even think I’m lying when I say that it’s me; I can’t always “pass” as female anymore. I’ve been thinking about this because school is starting soon, and I don’t know how I’ll handle my new teachers. I guess they’ll think I’m a boy until they learn my name; then they’ll probably think I’m an over-the-top bulldyke. It would be so easy to make them perceive me as male: my name is the only obstacle. I’ve been seriously thinking about pretending I have an unconventional boy name. If I’m really confident, I might be able to pull it off… Or is this plan just too wacky? One person told me it’ll probably backfire, another told me teachers don’t really care. But I’m not worried about teachers getting all homophobic with me: I’m just sick of female pronouns. Maybe the simple solution would be to talk sincerely with each teacher. But that’s too scary; I’d be seriously exposing myself to transphobia. Maybe I can stand being called “she,” after all. I only have one year of secondary school to tolerate; I don’t want to get into trouble unnecessarily.
