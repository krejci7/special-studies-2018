I don\u2019t want to mention their actual names, but take the name Andrea: it\u2019s mostly used for women, but in Italy it\u2019s a boy name. I know a cisgender guy named Andrea. My legal name isn\u2019t that versatile: it\u2019s kind of like Emily or Sarah, Juana or Daniela. I wonder if people would still believe me if I told them it\u2019s a rare boy name. I don\u2019t mean to keep my old name, but it\u2019s still on my ID and on teachers\u2019 lists at school; I\u2019d like to avoid being outed all the time. Some people even think I\u2019m lying when I say that it\u2019s me; I can\u2019t always \u201cpass\u201d as female anymore. I\u2019ve been thinking about this because school is starting soon, and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll handle my new teachers. I guess they\u2019ll think I\u2019m a boy until they learn my name; then they\u2019ll probably think I\u2019m an over-the-top bulldyke. It would be so easy to make them perceive me as male: my name is the only obstacle. I\u2019ve been seriously thinking about pretending I have an unconventional boy name. If I\u2019m really confident, I might be able to pull it off\u2026 Or is this plan just too wacky? One person told me it\u2019ll probably backfire, another told me teachers don\u2019t really care. But I\u2019m not worried about teachers getting all homophobic with me: I\u2019m just sick of female pronouns. Maybe the simple solution would be to talk sincerely with each teacher. But that\u2019s too scary; I\u2019d be seriously exposing myself to transphobia. Maybe I can stand being called \u201cshe,\u201d after all. I only have one year of secondary school to tolerate; I don\u2019t want to get into trouble unnecessarily.", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 genderkid"}
