I don\u2019t really think there\u2019s a ceremony, but there is a trial in a courtroom involving three witnesses. In my mind, I\u2019ve been picking my witnesses like others pick their groomsmen or bridesmaids (or bridesmen or groomspersons or\u2026), except with a bit more strategy. I\u2019m 19 and my closest friends are around my same age, and although I know they\u2019re responsible \u2013and they\u2019re the people who know me best\u2013 the judge will be more likely to trust older people. So I might choose one friend, one teacher and one family member. I\u2019m very lucky that I can count on several people to stand up for me. I have enough close friends to make it hard to pick just one; a few family members might agree to go; and I can ask my old Art History, Photography, Journalism and Psychology teachers (I don\u2019t know if they\u2019d all be willing go to court, which is scary and serious, but it\u2019s worth a try). I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have to go through a trial because I\u2019m not yet ready to change my name legally, and trans rights might be approved in Congress very soon, turning it into a matter of routine paperwork instead of having to sue the state. But if I did go through an ordeal involving witnesses, I think I\u2019d cry uncontrollably from the sheer weight of knowing that people are there for me. The very thought overwhelms me sometimes already, but the formal recognition of that support would push me into tearland. Maybe that\u2019s why people cry at weddings. Note: since writing this, I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s a really unromantic affair, and witnesses have to testify on their own in an office. Oh well. I can still daydream about the day name-change laws are modified, which will be much more important than any individual triumph.", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 genderkid"}
