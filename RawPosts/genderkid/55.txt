School starts again on Monday, so that will probably distract me \u2014 or drown me in stress and wrong pronouns. I\u2019m hoping for the former! But right now, I need to take a load off my chest. There are lots of details in life which can become issues when you\u2019re trans. Like when I wanted to sign up for an extracurricular class at school, and then I realized I would have to use my legal name. In that particular case, I happened to know the teacher, so we managed to work it out. But there are dozens of other little moments where things like old names can get in the way. Before the holidays, a few teachers assigned homework that we had to send in via email. When I decided to change my name, I also changed my email address because my old one included my girl name. I kept my old one, too, although I only use it when communicating with family members. After finishing my homework, I had to be very careful to send it from my old account; I double- and triple-checked to make sure I was signed in with the correct user name. And then I couldn\u2019t sign my messages, because there was no way I was signing my old name. Being called by my girl name does hurt \u2013depending on who says it, how, and how many times I\u2019ve had to put up with it recently\u2013 but it\u2019s nothing compared to having to introduce myself that way. Now that is corrosive. When someone else names me incorrectly, I feel misunderstood, or even detached: \u201coh, you mean me?\u201d. When I name myself incorrectly, I\u2019m betraying myself. I\u2019m putting up with the way others define me. In class, even though I have to passively accept the name that appears on the lists, I never have to actually assert it. I sign everything with my last name, and my very appearance is partially indicative of my gender. But the simple act of sending an email is an identity declaration, and in this situation I didn\u2019t know how to declare myself without hurting my feelings or my grades. Yes, I may have blown this slightly out of proportion. Maybe I\u2019ve just been angsty lately, but sending those emails was painful, as was putting up with the teacher\u2019s answers, which were fine, except for the name they called me. I actually abandoned my most important school project \u2014 it\u2019s hard enough as it is, and I couldn\u2019t bear the added strain of discussing it with my teacher via email. I\u2019ve had that in the back of my mind for weeks, stressing me out, but right now I can\u2019t deal with it. Not as a girl. I hadn\u2019t realized how important my name was for getting on with my daily life. When I see myself as a trans genderqueer boy, or whatever my identity is at the moment, I feel much more confident. That\u2019s why the whole struggle to get my name recognized is worthwhile: it\u2019s easier to sustain my identity when people aren\u2019t using a name that denies it. In the meantime, I\u2019m trying my best to hold my ground. To be nobody-but-yourself-in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else\u2014 means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight; and never stop fighting. \u2014e. e. cummings", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 genderkid"}
