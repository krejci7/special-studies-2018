At some point, I realized that I didn\u2019t care if people read me as trans or cis, as long as they respected me as a guy. Admittedly, though, it\u2019s hard to be perceived as a trans man at first glance \u2014 people usually see a cis butch woman or a cis man. In any case, one can usually only pass as cis (although some people are perceived as trans women, whether they are or not). Back when I started passing as male some of the time, I saw it as something completely out of my control \u2014 if someone perceived me as female, I was stuck with that label unless I wanted to come out. And even if I came out, the other person held the power to respect me or not, and I\u2019d have to justify my own gender in a way rarely demanded of cis people. But there was one time where I reacted differently. I went to a small used clothing store, looking for a jacket, and the owner started pulling out lots of tight-fitting, feminine items to show me. I was confused because I hadn\u2019t even thought about passing for months \u2013I was usually read as male at that point\u2013 and blurted out \u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019m not a girl!\u201d After a stunned second, she apologized and offered an explanation for the misunderstanding (\u201cI know you\u2019re not a girl, but, uh, boys these days wear all sorts of clothes\u2026\u201d). I had asserted myself with such emphasis that, for once, the roles were reversed: someone else had to justify themselves for misgendering me, instead of me acting apologetic for asking for the right pronouns. The passing tip I hear most often is \u201cbe confident\u201d, and it kinda annoys me because confidence can\u2019t make people see you as you wish (and that tip almost blames your attitude if you don\u2019t have passing privilege). But sometimes, in safe situations, confidence can help you have your gender respected, even if people haven\u2019t immediately seen you as a cis person of your target gender. Maybe they weren\u2019t even sure what to call you, and made their best guess, and would be happy to correct themselves. In my story, I don\u2019t know if the store owner ended up seeing me as a cis boy or a trans man, but in that situation it didn\u2019t matter. I just wanted to find the right clothes, and she was glad to help me with that.", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 genderkid"}
