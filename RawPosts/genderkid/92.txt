So many boxes. I prefer to see FtM as a neverending arrow: firmly rooted in a female past, pointing in the general direction of \u201cmale\u201d, but never quite meaning to reach it. In Sanscrit, ti means \u201carrow\u201d. It also means \u201clife\u201d. I marvel at how adaptable words like \u201cFtM\u201d are; I wonder how many different, colorful interpretations it might hold.", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 genderkid"}
