I’ve heard a few transmasculine and genderqueer people say they’re uncomfortable with the term FtM because it seems to imply a beginning and an end — you start in the female box, and end in the male box. So many boxes. I prefer to see FtM as a neverending arrow: firmly rooted in a female past, pointing in the general direction of “male”, but never quite meaning to reach it. In Sanscrit, ti means “arrow”. It also means “life”. I marvel at how adaptable words like “FtM” are; I wonder how many different, colorful interpretations it might hold.
