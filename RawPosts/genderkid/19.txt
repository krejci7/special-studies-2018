So I went slowly, only taking steps when absolutely necessary: first I chose a neutral name, then a male one, then I switched pronouns with different groups of people\u2026 By two years ago, I was living as male in small parts of my life (extracurricular classes where I was perceived as a cis boy, interactions with strangers). Fast forward to the present: I still don\u2019t identify as male1 , but I\u2019m perceived as one in all areas of my life. It can be odd to be read as cis and straight, and I do occasionally feel like parts of my identity are being erased; but\u00a0it feels comfortable enough, and it\u2019s much more fitting than passing as female. I\u2019m coming to accept that presenting as a binary gender doesn\u2019t mean that I have to identify as one; likewise, my identity \u2013or lack thereof\u2013 doesn\u2019t force me to constantly live outside the binary (close friends do know that I\u2019m neither here nor there). They\u2019re two different parts of my gender that don\u2019t have to \u201calign\u201d one way or the other, just like gender expression and gender identity and the body can combine in a myriad of ways. For me, it helps to remember that many people \u2013for many reasons\u2013 choose to present differently from how they identify:  trans people who don\u2019t want to transition, or transition in parts of their lives genderqueer people who live within the binary in history, \u201cpassing women\u201d2\u00a0 \u2014FAAB people who lived publicly as men\u2013 some of which lived/identified as women in their private circles.  I think it\u2019s important, though, to acknowledge that how I identify \u2013though important\u2013 is a rather abstract notion. I am being perceived as male, with all the privileges that it entails, and rejecting maleness is no excuse to deny it. Since starting university two months ago, I\u2019ve been living as male in my daily life to a further extent than ever before (and as a cis male to boot \u2014 I\u2019m not disclosing my trans status for now). I\u2019m curious to see how it feels in the long run, and whether I find a malehood that\u2019s a closer fit for me. I\u2019m pleased to announce, though, that I feel more at home with myself than ever before, socially and physically, so these gender explorations aren\u2019t so urgent; they\u2019re less about discomfort than about learning who I am as a person. Which, at 19, isn\u2019t such an odd thing to do. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014  1 Actually, I suspect that I don\u2019t have a deep-seated gender identity at all. I do feel strongly about certain gendered aspects like pronouns, names, and \u2013in Spanish\u2013 word endings, but I don\u2019t feel like those things coalesce into one steady identity. I\u2019m still exploring this, though. 2 \u201cpassing woman \u2013 chiefly used in the historical sense to refer to a non-transgendered woman living as a man in order to have access to careers and lifestyles only available to men at that time. Some historical figures who would today be more accurately called FTM transsexuals or transsexual men are sometimes referred to as passing women. \u201c \u2014 definition from the Ontario Human Rights Commission. Of course, it\u2019s hard to know how they identified and why they lived that way; the term probably lumps together wildly differently life-stories. Also, we shouldn\u2019t force today\u2019s categories onto the past.", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 genderkid"}
