But I ended up getting one last year, while I was still thinking gender-confused. So now I\u2019m trying to transition my profile over to male while facing the \u201cout or not\u201d dilemma. The actual female-to-male profile transition was easy. Luckily, I had signed up with my gender-neutral nickname; I changed it to my chosen name. I didn\u2019t have too many photos, either; a friend helped me purge the older, more female-looking ones. I had never marked my sex as \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d, and I left it that way, because I think it\u2019s annoying that they ask, especially if they only give me two options. Plus, my sex is none of their business. The hardest part is deciding whether I want to be out as trans on my Facebook or not. I don\u2019t actually state \u201cI\u2019m trans!\u201d anywhere, but I am part of many trans groups, and I have my gender blogs on my profile because I\u2019m proud of them. Plus, there are lots of tiny details: a friend signed one of my pictures \u201chaha, look at her\u201d. I didn\u2019t think I minded being out; but I\u2019ve been meeting new people and I don\u2019t necessarily want them to know I\u2019m trans when we\u2019ve just met. When people find out, they start treating me a little different; not unkindly, but as if they were seeing me differently: seeing me as a girl. It\u2019s the old question of when/how/if to come out, but instead of deciding in each individual situation, you have to decide once, for everyone you\u2019ll meet. And the newspaper keeps running articles on how important social networks are for getting jobs. Right now, most (all?) people in my life know I was assigned female at birth, and I\u2019m planning to do trans activism anyway, so it isn\u2019t worth it to hide my past. I think I\u2019ll probably open up a new Facebook account before starting college, which is when I plan to start T. It\u2019ll be a fresh start.", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 genderkid"}
