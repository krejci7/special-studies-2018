I\u2019ve only been asked that question twice, and both times the inquirer was a very young child. However, I have noticed people asking each other about my sex \u2013they probably only cared about my sex, and not my gender identity\u2013 as if I couldn\u2019t hear them. Or maybe they didn\u2019t even care whether I heard or not; maybe my gender ambiguity made me subhuman enough that my feelings didn\u2019t matter anymore. I wonder if it\u2019s a cultural thing; I think most of the people who were asked to their face were from the US, or at least from English-speaking countries (of course, it wouldn\u2019t be accurate to draw conclusions from only a few examples). I think it\u2019s easier when people attack you directly: I\u2019ve managed to handle that in the past. But hearing people discuss my sex always leaves me feeling upset and downtrodden. I\u2019ve never had the courage to stand up for myself. I can usually think up some responses, but only after the situation is past. I\u2019d like to say something along the lines of: \u201cIt\u2019s a boy, and he has ears, you know. So knock it off.\u201d or, \u201cWhatever I am, I\u2019m a human being; so please stop talking as if I couldn\u2019t hear you.\u201d Now I\u2019m perceived as male all the time, so I haven\u2019t had to go through this in a while. But school has already started and I\u2019m going to have to use the locker rooms soon; probably the women\u2019s room, since so many guys in the men\u2019s room would know me. So I\u2019ve prepared something to say to any girls who try to kick me out because they haven\u2019t met me: \u201cYou\u2019re first year students, aren\u2019t you? Well, I\u2019ve been using this room for over four years now, so. Oh, and welcome to our school.\u201d It\u2019s polite, but it establishes my relative authority on locker room use. And I don\u2019t apologize for my presence: I won\u2019t let myself feel inferior any longer. No one can make me feel inferior without my consent. PS: After hitting Publish, I realized that I might be a jerk for invading women\u2019s space. Not allowing myself to feel inferior doesn\u2019t mean I can steamroll girls\u2019 right to their private locker room (I don\u2019t believe in gender-segregated restrooms, but I do have to abide by existing rules). I really don\u2019t want to be an a-hole towards women; that was my biggest fear when I decided to transition. That said, I have a right to change my clothes somewhere, too; and lots of girls wouldn\u2019t mind because they already know me. I think there isn\u2019t a clear-cut answer to whose rights should prevail in this situation. What do you think: how can I respect the girls and manage to change my clothes?", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 genderkid"}
