All I have to do is walk down the hallway and I can see my little-girl-self staring back at me. Eerie. I think I was a girl back then; at least, I didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable being one. I was intrigued by how it would feel to be a boy, but I never wished I had been born in a different body (I still don\u2019t, even though sometimes I want my body to look different in some senses). Mostly I lived in a world that looked genderless to me, where I could love dinosaurs and stuffed animals at the same time. No one could get into my make-believe games and tell me they were unfeminine. My mom dressed me up in skirts and blouses from time to time, but I didn\u2019t care about clothes anyway (I avoided  mirrors until I started dressing masculinely). So I feel ambiguous about those old pictures. Childhood was nice, but it\u2019s time to move on. I hope my mom doesn\u2019t resent me for growing up to be her son.", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 genderkid"}
