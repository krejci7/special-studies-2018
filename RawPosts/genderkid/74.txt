I was very gender-confused at the time, but I didn\u2019t identify with those stories at all \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to be a man. Eventually I settled into a lesbian identity. Some people are lesbians because of the girls, I was a lesbian because of the gender possibilities: lesbians could have female bodies, yet be as masculine as they wished.\u00a0 Now I know that not all masculine females are lesbians or even women; heck, I\u2019m not even that masculine. But it was the only identity that made sense to me back then. I wonder what would have happened if I hadn\u2019t read about the concepts of trans-gender and genderqueer. Would I eventually have identified as transsexual? Would I have continued to be a butch female? Could I have been happy in one of those identities? I\u2019m more than satisfied with my queer trans identity; but would I be happier identifying as something that hasn\u2019t been invented yet? I\u2019m curious about the people who invented terms like transgender and genderqueer; how they managed to put a finger on their not-yet-named identity and name it. That must require a tremendous amount of creativity and self-awareness, and the ability to read an identity as yet illegible to other people. I\u2019m not done thinking about trans identities in their social context. For instance, I\u2019ve been wondering about \u201cpassing women\u201d: females who were perceived as male by everyone except for friends and lovers. They existed in the US in the early twentieth century. I wonder why that concept disappeared: was it because of picture IDs, which made it harder to hide their legal gender? Did those people even identify as \u201cwomen\u201d? I read Transgender Warriors by Les Feinberg a few months ago, but it left with a lot of questions; plus, I\u2019d like to know more about the history of trans identities right here in Argentina (most of what I learned I\u2019ve picked up from magazines and talking to trans people). This post by Tboy Jacky somewhat relates to the topic, in my opinion: he writes beautifully about how transition isn\u2019t an absolutely necessity to some people, but the best path among the many available. Thanks for describing this so eloquently, Jacky!", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 genderkid"}
