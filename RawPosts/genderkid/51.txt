School has been awful: my classmates haven\u2019t understood that I need to be called by my new name. This week was the worst \u2014 on Wednesday, the very second I stepped foot in the school building, I felt tears of frustration welling in my eyes. I spent the whole day trying not to cry, and since then I\u2019ve constantly felt on the verge of a nervous breakdown.\u00a0 Even the librarians have learned my (legal) name, so I\u2019ve lost my favorite hiding place. Today was much better, though \u2014 it\u2019s only going to school that makes me feel so bad. But this could be a good thing. I\u2019ve reached a point where going to school feels so bad that something has to give. I know I\u2019m not going to ditch school \u2013the school year finishes in only three months\u2013 and I know I\u2019m not going to spontaneously combust. That only leaves one option: my classmates have to start using my new name and pronouns. So, I have to convince them to do that somehow. I think I\u2019ll need to enlist one of my best friend\u2019s help to achieve this. I hope I haven\u2019t lost her friendship yet \u2014 I\u2019m sorry to say I\u2019ve been kind of hostile to everyone recently. Feeling like your identity is being constantly ignored doesn\u2019t help to put a smile on your face. And I hope I can explain my emotions well \u2014 I tried to tell her, once, how I felt about my name, and did an awful job. I might have said the opposite of what I really meant \u2014 I can be that bad at explaining things out loud. Writing is easier because there\u2019s less pressure and you have a chance to reorganize your ideas. Maybe I should stick to writing letters when it comes to clarifying trans stuff. This could be a huge chance for learning how to stand up for myself. I could regain some of my old friends. I didn\u2019t lose any friendships because of coming out, but several people simply couldn\u2019t get their names/pronouns right, and I couldn\u2019t bear to be constantly surrounded by people who ignored my identity \u2014 so I eventually phased them out of my life. Maybe, if I had clearly stated my position, I could have saved my friends. All in all, I could get a lot out of this lousy situation. I included a description of my negative feelings in this post because I want to remember how bad it feels to be called by the wrong name. I know that, when the going gets rough, I tend to wonder why I\u2019m transitioning at all \u2014 wouldn\u2019t it be easier to be a butch woman? At those times, I need to remember why I started to change my name and pronouns, why it would not be easier to \u201cjust be a woman\u201d. If I don\u2019t remember, I might enter a loop where I start transitioning, reach a roadblock, go back to \u201cfemale\u201d, feel awful, move towards \u201cmale\u201d, etc. Plus, I\u2019ve found some really awesome laws which should protect my gender identity at school. More on that later. I\u2019d like to start posting some actual, thoughtful content again \u2014 I\u2019ve sure been thinking a lot.", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 genderkid"}
