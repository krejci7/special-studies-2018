I just read the whole thing carefully: it\u2019s extremely well done. I love language and its subtleties so I usually find annoying little details in texts on trans issues. Not this time. Take a look at this: \u201cSome people seem to have a problem with the mere existence of human beings whose outer expression of their inner gender identity is not the same as their gender determined at birth. Aggression against transgender persons cannot however be excused as resulting from ignorance or lack of education\u201d Yippee, he said that the contradiction is between a transperson\u2019s gender expression/identity and the gender assigned at birth, and not between their gender and sex! Many transpeople feel fine about their sex and have no wish to change it, just like he acknowledges further on: \u201cTo require surgery as a prerequisite to enjoy legal recognition of one\u2019s gender identity ignores the fact that such operations are not always desired, medically possible, available, and affordable.\u201d Cisgender people \u2014even some transsexual people\u2014 aren\u2019t always aware of this. Again, thumbs up to the commissioner! I also like his definition of gender identity: \u201cGender identity is understood to refer to each person\u2019s deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the personal sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other expressions of gender, including dress, speech and mannerisms.\u201d And, \u201cThere is no excuse for not immediately granting this community their full and unconditional human rights. Council of Europe Member States should take all necessary concrete action to ensure that transphobia is stopped and that transgender persons are no longer discriminated against in any field.\u201d May it be.", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 genderkid"}
