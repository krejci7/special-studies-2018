I didn\u2019t change my mind: I just wanted to come out at the right moment, and I knew my parents were going to be really busy until now. I planned on coming out yesterday, but I lost my mind on Sunday and couldn\u2019t finish my letter. And then I didn\u2019t know how to actually hand it to them. At this very instant, my coming-out letter sits on the kitchen counter, waiting for my early-bird dad to find it a few hours from now. I don\u2019t feel as nervous as I did during the last few days. I\u2019ve been planning this for so long \u2013writing the letter, finding resources they could relate to, printing out articles by supportive parents of trans children\u2013 that it feels as if I had come out already (almost). At least, I\u2019m getting this over with. The tension was affecting me physically. Really, how shocked can my parents be when they read my letter? I\u2019m pretty sure my mom noticed that I bind. They already assume I\u2019m a lesbian, so being trans can\u2019t be SOOO much worse. In some senses it\u2019s \u201cworse\u201d \u2013I\u2019m altering their whole perception of their child\u2014 but they\u2019re already afraid for my safety; and it might be safer to be a straight-looking guy than a visibly queer woman. On the other hand, I wasn\u2019t much of a tomboy growing up, so they might hang onto that as \u201cproof\u201d that it\u2019s just a phase. These predictions are probably useless, because they\u2019re going to react with their hearts rather than their minds. Even if my trans identity were totally obvious, and made perfect sense, they would still be shocked. Wish me luck :) And above all, the confidence to get through this unscathed.", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 genderkid"}
