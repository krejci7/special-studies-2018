It might be the scariest movie I\u2019ll ever see, but I want to try and watch it. I\u2019ve made a promise to myself: I\u2019m going to stop watching if the film gets too strong. Maybe I should switch off the TV as soon as Brandon is about to get raped. Has anyone seen it? Should I avoid the ending? Edit: The TV guide was wrong \u2014 Boy\u2019s Don\u2019t Cry isn\u2019t showing. I still intend to watch it someday.", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 genderkid"}
