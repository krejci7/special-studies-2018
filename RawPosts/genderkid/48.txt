Uncategorized Boys Don't Cry Brandon Teena 
I just realized that Boys Don’t Cry is going to be on TV in an hour. It might be the scariest movie I’ll ever see, but I want to try and watch it. I’ve made a promise to myself: I’m going to stop watching if the film gets too strong. Maybe I should switch off the TV as soon as Brandon is about to get raped. Has anyone seen it? Should I avoid the ending? Edit: The TV guide was wrong — Boy’s Don’t Cry isn’t showing. I still intend to watch it someday.
