Also, it coincided with my last day of school (hooray for summer!), so it\u2019s a good chance to look back on the past year or so. In retrospect, it\u2019s amazing how much I\u2019ve socially blossomed this year. I knew my body was holding me back, but I didn\u2019t realize how much until I managed to align my body with my mental \u201cbody map\u201d. Perhaps it\u2019s like getting glasses when you\u2019ve had slightly fuzzy vision your whole life: you suddenly realize how clear the world can look and you don\u2019t understand how you managed to get by beforehand. Although I didn\u2019t think that changing my body would change my life so drastically, I did want to physically transition before university so I could feel confident when meeting new people. I didn\u2019t believe I could keep my past private for long \u2013though, as it turned out, I could and did\u2013 but I did want to feel comfortable with myself. People already saw me as male before T, but they often stared at me, wondering why a little kid was in their class. And my chest was manageable before surgery, but I couldn\u2019t deal with binding anymore, and it was really awkward whenever someone patted my back or chest. I know I was privileged to \u201cpass\u201d as my gender, but physical transition was something I needed for these reasons and many others. Luckily, I was able to start testosterone seven or eight months before starting university, so no one questioned me about my age. And I had top surgery a week before the first day of school; though I wish I\u2019d had more time to recover, getting that done before classes started was one of the best things that has ever happened to me. Suddenly, interacting with people was easy. Sure, I was still slightly socially awkward, but I didn\u2019t have to worry about my body anymore. I actually made friends, and even some close friends! It was as if I\u2019d been walking against a wall, and the wall had suddenly been lifted: I glided smoothly into a new role as a friendly person, astonishing my old friends and even myself. (My personality and tastes weren\u2019t radically altered; for instance, I\u2019m still introverted and avoid parties. What shifted is how I interact with other people.) Before each of my transitional-related decisions I reminded myself that transitioning isn\u2019t a magic solution to everything: after all, cis people can also be shy, socially awkward, anxious, etc. But for me, transitioning was kind of magic. I\u2019m still amazed at how quickly my life changed for the better after changing my body. I\u2019m so glad that I made the decision to do it, and that I had the resources and support to make it possible. It\u2019s like a second chance at life. I am so grateful.", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 genderkid"}
