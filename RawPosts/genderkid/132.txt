I\u2019ve had it for almost 17 years, which is enough time to get used to anything. Okay, it might feel a little awkward to hear it pronounced, or to say it myself. And it\u2019s certainly weird to see feminine women called that same name. But most of my friends call me by my androgynous nickname, which they made up unawares of my gender explorations. Even so, I\u2019ve daydreamed about having a more neutral name. The thing is, most Hispanic names come from saints, who are very gendered persons indeed; so I\u2019d have to go for a foreign name. There are many that I love \u2013such as Dhani, like George Harrison\u2019s son\u2013, but for me, a name has to really fit, like an old t-shirt. Exotic names, even gorgeous ones, feel sort of scratchy. After thinking about all this, and since I can\u2019t legally change my name anyway, I decided to just keep my given name. But as John Lennon said, life is what happens to you when you\u2019re trying to make other plans. I swear I wasn\u2019t looking for a new, male, name for myself. I was actually trying to do some homework when suddenly I remembered certain name. It\u2019s old, it\u2019s religious, it\u2019s just an ordinary name. I don\u2019t even know how a totally male name could fit me. But it fits.", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 genderkid"}
