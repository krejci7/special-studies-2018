Gender Outlaw started the Transman Mapping Project (a great idea!): The idea is simple: just add your name or alias (it can be anonymous) and a marker to the map so that we can create a bird\u2019s eye view of how transmen are spread out around the world. If you\u2019ve ever had that feeling of being alone in your transition, a quick look at the map will show you otherwise. We really are everywhere! -Gender Outlaw I\u2019ve been looking through Scarleteen (\u201csex ed for the real world\u201d) and I found a great article called \u201cGenderPalooza! A Sex & Gender Primer\u201d. I love how it invites cisgender people to defy gender norms. It also has an awesome section called \u201cHow to Be Transfriendly and Subvert Crummy Gender Roles at the Same Time, in Five Easy Steps!\u201d: 3) Nix staring and whispering.

I feel honored!", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 genderkid"}
