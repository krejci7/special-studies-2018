Sometimes my legal —female— name feels like a weapon in other people’s mouths. If you know that name, you have power over me: the power to make me feel really bad and uncomfortable. The thing about this weapon, what makes it different from sticks and stones, is that you can wield it unwittingly if you don’t know how it makes me feel. The other special thing about this weapon is that I can defend myself without batting an eye. Eleanor Roosevelt said that “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent”. Well, no one can make me feel female without my consent. If you call me _____ I can feel bad, or I can think that you’re a fool for committing such a silly mistake. I’d rather pick the latter. I just remembered a great post by Renee, where she tells about a group of boys that laughed at her when they noticed she was trans. But instead of blaming herself of for not passing, she blames the kids for being so rude. It’s up to us to feel good about ourselves.
