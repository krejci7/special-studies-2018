I really want to get my fellow students to rethink gender, but it\u2019s hard to convince people to come to an educational thing voluntarily. So maybe I should start out with the people who come to our diversity group meetings (queer-straight alliance type thing we founded last year). I could print out a version of the Yay! Genderform and hand it out. Sarah from Genderfork thinks that might work, and I do too (thanks for the idea, Sarah!): Hey, so I\u2019ve been on this little kick lately to try to get people to see their gender as a list of descriptive words. For example, I want to claim my gender as: female, androgynous, queer. The people I explain this to tend to get it \u2014 it makes sense. But then, when I ask how they identify, I get a deer-in-headlights look of \u201cOh! Um! Off the top of my head? I dunno!\u201d I have a little theory that if I handed them a list of pre-approved Gender Words, they\u2019d have a much easier time with this exercise. Maybe people would be overwhelmed at first, but if you include funny terms, or words that cisgender people can relate to, they might loosen up and play along (things like \u201cglamorous\u201d and \u201cfriend of Dorothy\u201d should be well-received among a queer crowd). Julian also suggested printing out your gender badge and handing it out to people. I\u2019d like to make stickers and paste them onto every form that asks you to  check \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d (a \u201cnone of your business\u201d sticker would work, too). PS: The Yay! Genderform is now 929 terms strong \u2014 I suggested \u201cputo\u201d and \u201ctortillera\u201d, which are Spanish for \u201cfag\u201d and \u201cdyke\u201d. The list seems to be growing every day!", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 genderkid"}
