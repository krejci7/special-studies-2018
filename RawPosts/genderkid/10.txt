When I started transitioning, gay men smirked or laughed (or at least looked confused) when I expressed an attraction to guys: they left it very clear that I could never be \u201cone of them\u201d. Now that I \u201cpass\u201d as cis, people assume I\u2019m a cis gay male when I\u2019m in lgbtq spaces, but men still lose interest when they find out I\u2019m trans. I don\u2019t want to be part of a community which has so many problems with inclusion (not just trans inclusion), but I\u2019m still attracted to men, and it would be nice to be desired. I know that some cis men are ok with trans guys, but it\u2019s hard to know who they are. My theory is that most men would answer \u201cno\u201d if asked \u201cwould you date a trans man?\u201d, but that many would date a trans man if they found out after getting to know him. If that were true, I\u2019d eventually find someone if I started hitting on large quantities of men. But it\u2019s really tiring; every rejection gets me so down on myself that it takes months for me to regain confidence (plus, I suck at the art of flirting!). It\u2019s not only being trans that makes me feel undesirable: I actually love being trans, and I love my body, though it isn\u2019t always easy in a (cis)sexist world. I don\u2019t feel ugly, exactly, but I do know I\u2019m not terribly attractive (because of my personality, my voice, my inability to dance\u2026). I really identify with this quote by transartorialism: \u201c\u2026sometimes to me it feels like we build our primary bridges into (gender)queer communities by arching our backs in bed, and that makes it so much harder for those of us with bodies and minds and personalities that are not the model of desire in our \u201ccommunities\u201d and even less so on the outside.\u201d Most of the time I don\u2019t mind being single; family and friends are enough. But every once in a while I see two men together and I feel a longing to have that for myself, and it saddens me to know that it probably won\u2019t happen. Of course, the idea of finding someone is scary, too: I\u2019ve grown wary of cis men, so I\u2019m really apprehensive of trusting them with my body. I usually try to ignore the sadness until it goes away and proceed with life as usual; I wonder if I\u2019ll every break the cycle and actually do something about it.", "feedtitle": "genderkid"}
