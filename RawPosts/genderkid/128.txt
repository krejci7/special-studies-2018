I noticed the \u201cmale\u201d deodorant has sperm on the label. I mean, a drawing of three spermatozoids, one of which uses Axe (presumably) and therefore is ahead of the rest. That, combined with the name of the scent (Conviction), sends a really strong message about masculinity. The way I read it, it says \u201creal men are stronger and better than the rest. they make sure their sperm reaches its target:conviction is all they need, not consent. oh, and they use Axe.\u201d The middle part -about not waiting for consent- is sort of a free interpretation: that day I was angry about the way masculinity is constructed. But the marketing idea is clearly sexual. My \u201clady\u2019s\u201d deodorant, on the other hand, is shaped like a female -it has a waist- and it shows a dove, which stands for peace (passivity? peace isn\u2019t always passive, but that\u2019s the way it\u2019s shown). It also advertises the fact that it contains cream, which protects the skin \u2013 women are supposed to be more worried about skincare. The hugest difference is that my \u201cmale\u201d antiperspirant is really explicitly sexual, and everyone\u2019s okay with that, even if they\u2019re shocked by a short-ish skirt. That shocks me.", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 genderkid"}
