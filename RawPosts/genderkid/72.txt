The creators think it\u2019s important to preserve these zines \u201cbecause of what they represented \u2013 a look at queers\u2019 lives, stories, and histories that are seldom visible through mainstream media.\u201d They also make for great reads: zines are usually very personal and sincere, poetic, and sometimes funny. Plus they delight the senses, with all the nice pictures and typography. I found a lot of gender, trans and genderqueer-related zines, both within the Archive and around the internet. Here are my favorites. In the Archive, click on \u201cdownload document in original format\u201d to see each issue. And be warned: most zines have some mature or graphic content. Gendercide: issue 1 (on being a boy in a boy\u2019s body\u2026 but still being dissatisfied), issue 2 (on the lack of butches nowadays), issue 3 (\u201cchemical warfare\u201d: the effects of MtF hormone therapy) gendertrash: this is the oldest publication where I found the phrase \u201cgender queer\u201d  (1993, wow). Testosterone Junky: \u201cWhen I strap down my tits, I can\u2019t take a breath, but I breathe freer suffocating in layers than naked under another\u2019s eye.\u201d Project 76: The Politics of my Body: on being a fat FTM: \u201cMax. He was this fictional character or maybe invisible friend or something that I used to draw when I was about eleven\u2026 The teacher asked me, why do you draw this character all of the time? I replied with I dunno. And the boy sitting across from me shouts out, \u2018because she wants to be him when she grows up!'\u201d the.naked.riot: one of the writers is a trans guy (here\u2018s a hand-drawn comic about testosterone therapy): \u2026what happens when you have this mental image of yourself as your father\u2019s oldest son, the brightest boy on the girl\u2019s soccer team, and you start growing tits? Yeah, good question. from Post-Gender: confessions of a post-binary transsexual \u2013 in issue 1 The article The Big Gay Lie from HOMOzine always lifts my spirits: The Big Gay Lie is essentially the efforts of a group of a**holes who want to make sure you feel fat and ugly and generally horrible\u2026But don\u2019t worry. There are three simple things you can do to escape The Big Gay Lie. Step 1: Listen to lots of Bikini Kill or Gayrilla Biscuits and accept the fact that you\u2019re 100%, no questions asked, without a doubt hot. Gender Trouble: brief comic on \u201cthe bathroom problem\u201d \u2014 being unwelcome in any public restroom. Genderf*ck me: adult-content comic; I love the cover art. Portrait of the Artist as a Young Trannie: I\u2019m still reading through this one.", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 genderkid"}
