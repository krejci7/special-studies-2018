I needed time to mull over the decision and do a little mourning, though I think I\u2019m finally ready. Every step of my transition was deliberate, carefully thought-out. I knew full well that I didn\u2019t have to bind, or wear clothes from the men\u2019s department, or take T, or have surgery unless I really wanted to (or needed to). Transness isn\u2019t a package that you buy whole. And I know that my ID says nothing about me as a person: not changing it is a valid option. There are a few trans people in my life who are choosing to keep their old IDs even though they publicly transitioned years ago. For me, changing my name legally is fraught with emotions, especially because I have to modify my birth certificate before updating anything else. In part, I feel like I\u2019m erasing my past, dishonoring the person I\u2019ve been, pegging myself like a butterfly in the little \u201cmale\u201d box. It\u2019s like reliving what I felt when I socially transitioned, and again when I physically transitioned. Once again, I have to remind myself that change is part of life, that it\u2019s ok to move forward, that no change in appearance or documentation can take away my past without my consent. On the one hand, correcting my ID is a no-brainer because I\u2019ve been living as male for a long time and it\u2019s worked for me so far; on the other hand, it feels like a big step because it\u2019s my final one (I might get a hysterectomy eventually, but only if it\u2019s medically necessary and it won\u2019t be about transitioning). It\u2019s the only thing left that marks me as visibly trans, and though being visible can be uncomfortable, it has its bright side too: some people are deeply moved by knowingly meeting a trans man for the first time and I\u2019d like to think that the encounter makes them more trans-friendly. Having to share something so intimate has also brought me closer to some people, like teachers, who I might not have approached personally otherwise. Ultimately, I know I need to change my documentation to function in daily life. I avoid situations where I need to show ID \u2013like doctor\u2019s offices\u2013 because it\u2019s awkward and people get suspicious; at school I\u2019m constantly afraid of discrimination and being \u201couted\u201d without my consent. I guess I could handle it if I were more self-confident and willing to disclose, but I feel prepared to move on and save my fuel for other battles. I\u2019m ready.", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 genderkid"}
