I haven\u2019t been injecting testosterone: it\u2019s just been there for years. I remember being embarrassed about it when I was 13 or 14. I hadn\u2019t seen any media images of women or females with moustaches, so there surely was something wrong with having facial hair (I use \u201cwomen\u201d and \u201cfemales\u201d interchangeably because, at that point, I thought they were the same thing). The same went for leg hair, and for a while I was really paranoid about the hair on the back of my hands. I had heard that shaving made things worse \u2013since you can see the thick base of the hair instead of the thin tip\u2013 so I tried depilating creams, plucking and wax. Ouch! Eventually, I realized that there were women with body hair \u2014 lots of them. Who would have guessed that media representations of women were far from accurate?! I had been so busy feeling ashamed of myself that I hadn\u2019t realized that some of my female friends had even fuller moustaches than I did. If I hadn\u2019t noticed, maybe no one could notice my hair, either. I relaxed a little, although tried to I keep my facial hair at a minimum until I started identifying as male. That\u2019s when I started shaving. I thought that shaving didn\u2019t truly stimulate growth, but in the past year I started noticing that my facial hair was more visible. My moustache and sideburns probably look darker due to shaving, but my chin is definitely developing more and more thick hairs \u2014 not a full-blown beard, but past the \u201callowed\u201d female amount. It might be the shaving, it might be hormonal; I only know that it\u2019s there. My body is typically female and it grows facial hair. So why are beards construed as male? No wonder Leslie Feinberg includes (cissexual) women with beards under the gender-variant umbrella: they\u2019re defying the very rules of what female bodies are allowed to do. I\u2019m trying to tie in my critique of male/female body construction with the fact that I want my body to look more male-typical: I want the narrow hips, the beard, the low voice. Those seem like opposite notions \u2014 my desire to transition physically appears to reinforce the construction of a male, masculine, man\u2019s body. I think the connection lies within the idea of freedom: people should be allowed to do whatever they want with their bodies, no matter if they don\u2019t fit into traditional notions of what a \u201cnormal\u201d body looks like. And I should do whatever I want with my body, even if that brings my body closer to the standards of what men\u2019s bodies look like \u2014 after all, if I withheld my deep desire of transition in order to \u201cfree the gender/sex system\u201d, how could I be freeing myself? I\u2019d just be creating a new set of standards that limit my liberty. I know that my facial hair doesn\u2019t make me any more of a man. I could identify as a woman and still embrace it. But it\u2019s something I enjoy, so I\u2019m going to go ahead and embrace it. As a person. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 PS: your might be interested in Female Faces: How facial hair influences women\u2019s everyday experiences, a site created by a woman who sports a goatee.
