Legal gender Names School name change postaweek2011 university 
I signed up for university this week. I feel so excited!  At the place where I’ll be studying, there’s a new rule that allows trans students and workers to use their chosen names. So after enrolling with my legal name, I headed to the office for Student Well-Being to sort that out. I was unsure about what would happen: I’d heard that the administrative staff blatantly ignored trans people’s appeals. But the staff members that I talked to were wonderful. They didn’t know how to satisfy my request –the information system hasn’t been updated to handle chosen names– but they went out of the way to find out what I should do; and, more importantly, they immediately understood the validity of my claim. I ended up leaving them a letter –formalizing my request– that they’ll send to the office for Legal Issues. I don’t know if my name will be changed before school starts, but I trust that it will happen at some point. Knowing that, I don’t mind if I have to explain things to my professors for this semester. The rule allowing for chosen names is new, after all, and even if the practical aspects haven’t been worked out, at least the staff believe in trans rights.  The future looms bright for me and all the other trans members of my school. If you’ve been reading my blog for a while you might be confused because  last year I also posted about starting university. I did begin last year, sort of: where I  live, there’s often a transition year between secondary school and  higher education, and that’s what I was doing. Now I’ll finally start  studying for my chosen major.
