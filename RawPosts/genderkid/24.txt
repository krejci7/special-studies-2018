I feel so excited!\u00a0 At the place where I\u2019ll be studying, there\u2019s a new rule that allows trans students and workers to use their chosen names. So after enrolling with my legal name, I headed to the office for Student Well-Being to sort that out. I was unsure about what would happen: I\u2019d heard that the administrative staff blatantly ignored trans people\u2019s appeals. But the staff members that I talked to were wonderful. They didn\u2019t know how to satisfy my request \u2013the information system hasn\u2019t been updated to handle chosen names\u2013 but they went out of the way to find out what I should do; and, more importantly, they immediately understood the validity of my claim. I ended up leaving them a letter \u2013formalizing my request\u2013 that they\u2019ll send to the office for Legal Issues. I don\u2019t know if my name will be changed before school starts, but I trust that it will happen at some point. Knowing that, I don\u2019t mind if I have to explain things to my professors for this semester. The rule allowing for chosen names is new, after all, and even if the practical aspects haven\u2019t been worked out, at least the staff believe in trans rights.\u00a0 The future looms bright for me and all the other trans members of my school. If you\u2019ve been reading my blog for a while you might be confused because  last year I also posted about starting university. I did begin last year, sort of: where I  live, there\u2019s often a transition year between secondary school and  higher education, and that\u2019s what I was doing. Now I\u2019ll finally start  studying for my chosen major.", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 genderkid"}
