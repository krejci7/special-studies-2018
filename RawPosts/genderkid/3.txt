We met on facebook \u2013where we had several trans and trans-friendly friends in common\u2013 and he was super cool about trans issues, but I wanted to meet in person before telling him. In previous flirting situations I had disclosed my trans status early on and it ended up being a conversation-stopper, so I was curious about this new strategy. (Besides, I wasn\u2019t sure yet if I was super interested.) We had dinner and then talked for hours. In person I wasn\u2019t really attracted to him, but I decided to disclose anyway to see how he\u2019d react. I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t always live as male\u201d, which was kind of ambiguous, so then I clarified \u201cI\u2019m a trans man like so-and-so\u201d. He didn\u2019t seem too shocked, although he did stare harder at me for the rest of the conversation. I went on to say, \u201cI thought I should tell you because I know it changes things.\u201d He answered, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything for me,\u201d and after a pause, \u201cYou\u2019re really cute.\u201d It was a super positive experience, and it\u2019s too bad I\u2019m not into this guy. I was doubtful about this disclosure-after-meeting strategy because I thought men might feel disappointed: they might still find me attractive after finding out \u2013they might me despite being trans\u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t be what they\u2019d expected. I reckoned that if guys knew about my trans status early on and they still wanted to meet me, I\u2019d be sure that they liked the whole package (which is nicer than being liked despite this or that). But this guy really took it in stride; if anything, he seemed more interested afterwards. I know that not everyone will react this way (some people have a hard time with unexpected surprises of any kind) but it was a huge confidence boost. I feel like more and more doors are opening for me in the dating world; or rather, they were always unlocked but I had never dared to try them.", "feedtitle": "genderkid"}
