I\u2019ve known the teacher for a couple of years \u2013he used to teach at my school\u2013 so he knows I\u2019m trans, but no one else figured it out. I used to think they might, but since then I\u2019ve learned that most people in my context will see me as a guy. I could say that I \u201cpass\u201d well, but I know that in other places I might be perceived differently; so I won\u2019t take any credit. That class was my safe haven; the one place where I was treated unconditionally as a boy. Until very recently, only my closest friends managed to use my preferred name and pronouns, and on my insecure days I doubt that they really see me as a guy (well, I know they can\u2019t, but it only matters on insecure days). With my journalism mates, I knew that my masculinity wouldn\u2019t be constantly in question. If I didn\u2019t bind too tightly, no one would think \u201cah, her \u2013his\u2013 breasts are showing\u201d; they wouldn\u2019t even be aware of my chest. If I didn\u2019t act super-macho, they wouldn\u2019t attribute it to my female past. Having that space to look forward to, every week, helped keep me sane. I might say that I was/am \u201cstealth\u201d there, but I didn\u2019t feel like I was lying. Although I always got along well with my classmates, we\u2019ve never spoken much about our personal lives. I didn\u2019t have any reasons to come out as trans, and I did have a very good reason not to: my maleness would begin to be questioned, and I didn\u2019t know if it would hold up to their scrutiny. Some people, after learning I\u2019m trans, suddenly start using all the wrong pronouns; after all, for a heteronormative mind, it\u2019s very easy to see me as a female/girl. I did not want to lose my gender oasis. This last class, the teacher invited a gay activist for us to interview (gotta love this teacher). The activist was really trans-positive, so afterwards, when we were walking together to the bus stop \u2013him, a classmate, and I\u2013 I mentioned I was trans. My classmate was surprised and said I didn\u2019t have to \u201chide\u201d who I was \u2014 uh, sorry, I was being myself when I introduced myself as a guy. But all in all, she was cool about it. Also, she wasn\u2019t sure whether I was a trans boy or a trans girl \u2014 I love it when I confuse people that way. (I might miss my androgyny a bit if I take T, although it\u2019s worth it.) Knowing this person, she\u2019s probably going to tell some of our other classmates, which is fine. We only have a few lessons left before summer break, so I don\u2019t have much to lose, and it\u2019s a good chance to teach the other students a couple of things about trans people. First, that we aren\u2019t always visible. Second, that we can be kinda nice people. A couple of kids made transphobic jokes at one point, so I hope I make them reconsider their view of trans folk \u2014 or at least, make them think twice before telling those jokes among people they think are cis. I\u2019m not going to change the world, but I think tiny actions like this do help a little. I hope that, someday, I feel strong enough to do more.", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 genderkid"}
