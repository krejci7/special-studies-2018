My middle name won\u2019t be so important, so I can relax and think about what it will mean to me: do I want it to have a symbolic meaning, honor someone I admire, or be original? I thought of using something rare because my first and last names are pretty common \u2014 there are two people at my school with my same full name. I considered a couple of non-Spanish names, but using something non-European seems like cultural appropriation, and using something from the elsewhere in Europe \u2013especially something in English\u2013 seems like selling out to cultural imperialism (although, of course, Spaniards came to this land through colonialism). I want to read more about these issues, but in the meantime, I think I\u2019ll stick to Hispanic names. At least they feel more familiar. I also thought of using my old name as a middle name, but right now, it\u2019s hard for me to even hear it. Sometimes, when I stumble over it unexpectedly, I feel a little confused \u2014 is that really my ID? Both reactions \u2013rejection and detachment\u2013 aren\u2019t exactly positive, so I can rule out that option. Actually, I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s legal for a guy to have a girl name: the Argentinian naming law forbids any names that cause confusion about a person\u2019s sex (it also forbids \u201cextravagant\u201d, \u201cridiculous\u201d or hard-to-pronounce names, which sounds rather imprecise). There are traditional exceptions, such as Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 for a girl and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda for a boy. In any case, right now, it\u2019s impossible for me to get a name or gender change on my ID for legal reasons that I\u2019ll explain in a future post. My best choice is my dad\u2019s middle name. I love it for several reasons: it\u2019s a way to pay tribute to my father, I like how it sounds, and I like its initial \u2014 it fits well into the rest of my name.\u00a0 Plus, I identify strongly with it, and its meaning seems appropriate: \u201cnew house\u201d. My first name, by the way, means \u201cfree\u201d \u2014 interpreting broadly, I\u2019d be free to find my place in the world. Those meanings aren\u2019t uber-important to me; it\u2019s nice to know that my name doesn\u2019t mean \u201ccranky\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t have much weight in daily life. People are more likely to associate other people with their namesakes rather than with their name\u2019s origin. For instance, the name Eva, to most Argentinians, would evoke Eva Per\u00f3n rather than Adam and Eve. None of my names has such a strong association, which is fine by me \u2014 it could become an onerous burden. And I want to be \u201cfree to find my own place in the world\u201d, don\u2019t I? For now, at least, I\u2019m enjoying the freedom to try on different middle names.", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 genderkid"}
