A die-hard, no-man-will-ever-touch-me dyke. However, when I started seeing myself as a boy, my attractions shifted: I began seeing the beauty in male bodies, and now I hardly even look at women. At first, I thought it might be confusion; maybe I didn\u2019t desire a male body for my partner, but for myself (the do-be-do-be-do complex!). I don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely, though. I can totally picture myself going out with a man now that I\u2019m a transman myself. Back when I identified as a lesbian, I couldn\u2019t have pictured that. I could not see myself, as a woman, going out with a man. Now\u2026 ohh darn, men are gorgeous. I can see myself going out with people of any sex or gender identification. I\u2019m most attracted to people whose gender lies between androgynous and masculine, but within that, I think I\u2019d be willing to date men, women, genderqueers or others; and I could be attracted to a femme person, eventually. Does that mean I\u2019m bisexual? I don\u2019t like that word; it implies that there are only two sexes; or maybe two genders? In any case, there are way more than two. I prefer \u201cqueer\u201d. Even if I turn out to be only attracted to men, I\u2019d prefer queer over \u201cgay\u201d or \u201cfag\u201d or the even more inaccurate \u201chomosexual\u201d because I don\u2019t identify completely with the gender binary (transfag would work, though). S. Bear Bergman put it best:  At the base, the current terms of sexual orientation that the language offers (hetero, homo, bi) are problematic because they rely on a bipolar gendered system that is coming apart at the seams even as we fuck. In order to identify myself as a heterosexual, I first have to be able to identify in some sort of concrete way what my own gender is, and then decide whether it has an opposite, which still does not, in the strictest sense, fulfill the definition of heterosexual because hetero isn\u2019t Greek for \u201copposite,\u201d it\u2019s Greek for \u201cother\u201d. So as long as I\u2019m attracted to people of a different gender than I am, I am heterosexual, except that in this language that\u2019s really just one other and also I might be attracted to someone who is the same sex but a different gender, and so I as a butch could therefore be attracted to femmes and call myself heterosexual under that definition (\u2026).   Queer doesn\u2019t assume any gender, or any sexual behavior, only a certain disregard for social norms regarding gendered and sexual behavior. That\u2019s a sexual orientation that may wear better, whatever changes the next hundred years may bring.", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 genderkid"}
