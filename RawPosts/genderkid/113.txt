One transman\u2019s letter really got to me. Here\u2019s part of it: When you are young, you can be who you are, and keep it a \u201csecret\u201d from everyone who tells you that you are wrong, and you survive. Puberty and the mirror, however, quickly become your worst nightmare. You look in the mirror and YOU see what everyone was talking about. \u2013From Transgender Book Project Exactly! I didn\u2019t feel trans earlier because I didn\u2019t look at myself in the mirror, even after puberty. I thought it was really superficial to look at oneself and I made a point of not checking my appearance whenever I passed a reflective surface, unlike everyone else. Later, when I started dressing more masculinely*, I could tolerate my image. But whenever I caught my reflection by accident, if my body shape was noticeable, something still felt amiss. Now that I feel comfortable with my male gender identity, I\u2019m coming to terms with my body. I will start hormone therapy as soon as possible and I probably will pursue chest surgery. But I know that my present body doesn\u2019t make me any less of a man. * I have my ex-girlfriend to thank for this. She was the first gay friend I had; I only accepted myself as queer after meeting her. That led to a huge gender liberation which ended in self-discovery. But that\u2019s a whole new post. Thanks, P!\u00a0 =) And a happy new year to all.", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 genderkid"}
