I\u2019ve thought about it ever since identifying as trans and finally decided that this surgery is right for me. And I came out to my parents over a year ago, so they\u2019re pretty ready, too (although they are scared \u2014 more on that later). Both surgeons are confident that I\u2019m a good candidate for the peri-areolar procedure. I was astonished, being borderline A/B\u00a0 cup, and having come to terms with the prospect of big scars from the double-incision method (both are described here). As the doctors explained the operation, I realized that they were describing the purse-string/draw-string/concentric circles procedure, which I had seen online; I had always assumed that it was rarely done, therefore not an available option. I\u2019d like to share the resources I\u2019ve rounded up about this kind of surgery. I\u2019ll include places where you can see \u201cbefore\u201d pictures because I didn\u2019t believe I could get good results from peri until I saw how chests like mine turned out. Resources on peri-areolar top surgery The main obstacle to understanding this procedure, for me, stemmed from all the different terms used to describe it. Some call it simply peri-areolar; others specify \u201cperi-areolar concentric circles\u201d or \u201cperi-areolar with purse-string (draw-string) sutures\u201d; and still others use the terms peri and keyhole interchangeably. What distinguishes peri from keyhole is that a ring of skin is removed around the areola, which makes this procedure available for medium breasts where there is excess skin. The edge of the remaining circle is larger than the areola so it has to  be drawn taut like a drawstring bag. The result is a puckered border, although it smooths  out over the following months. It can be done on A to B cups, depending  on the surgeon and your skin elasticity (important to avoid puckering or wrinkles). In keyhole, there\u2019s just a small incision below the areola through which breast tissue is sucked out. No skin is removed, so it\u2019s limited to small A or AA cups. More detailed descriptions Dr Medalie explains peri and double-incision, and how he decides which to use on a patient.

Photos and personal accounts Gender Outlaw described his experience with this kind of procedure and continues to post pictures where you can see how he\u2019s healed in the long term (see posts tagged \u201cchest  surgery\u201d and \u201ctransition photos\u201d). Jasper posted pictures from before and after surgery until 4 weeks post-op. He had a full B cup, but turned out fine. Warning: graphic images of healing nipples. XXBoy also documented his surgery; see his \u201ctop surgery\u201d tag or his post summarizing the whole experience, including how he lost a nipple (which is uncommon) and how that made him feel. Transbucket has hundreds of user-submitted pictures of all kinds of trans/genderqueer/etc related surgeries. You have to register, but it\u2019s well worth it. Some people post \u201cbefore\u201d images.   The McLean Clinic has two  sets of before/after pictures of what looks like peri (it\u2019s described as  keyhole, but I think the \u201cbefore\u201d chests were too large not to  need skin removal; it might be a difference in terms).
