Some of her words could have come right out of my mouth (had I been such a fine poet, that is): \u201cIt\u2019s not that I thought I\u2019d grow up to be a man; I just never thought that I\u2019d grow up to be a woman either. From what I could tell neither of those categories fit me, but believe me, I knew from a very young age never to say \u201cHey dad, this Adam or Eve thing isn\u2019t working for me; I mean, what about all the kinds of people in between?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m not gay. No, I\u2019m not straight, and I\u2019m sure as hell not bisexual, damn it!\u201d  She rocks. My transcription, after the jump. When I was a kid I would sometimes secretly call myself Andrew. Would tug at the crotch of my pants the way only pubescent boys do, ran around pounding on my bare chest like Tarzan. It\u2019s not that I thought I\u2019d grow up to be a man; I just never thought that I\u2019d grow up to be a woman either. From what I could tell neither of those categories fit me, but believe me, I knew from a very young age never to say \u201cHey dad, this Adam or Eve thing isn\u2019t working for me; I mean, what about all the kinds of people in between?\u201d In the third grade, Lynnette Lyons asked me where all my Barbies were, lied and told her I\u2019d got in trouble so my mom took \u2019em away. I didn\u2019t dare say \u201cBarbies suck, Lynnette! And for that matter, Tommy, so does GI Joe.\u201d I wanna grow into something none of us has ever seen before, and gender is just one of the ways we\u2019re boxed in and labeled, before we\u2019re ever able to speak who we dream we are, who we believe we\u2019ll become, like drumbeats ever changing their rhythm. I am living today as someone I had not yet become yesterday, and tonight I will borrow only pieces of who I was today to carry with me to tomorrow. No, I\u2019m not gay. No, I\u2019m not straight, and I\u2019m sure as hell not bisexual, damn it! I am whatever I am when I am it, loving whoever you are when the stars shine and whoever you\u2019ll be when the sun rises. Yes, I like girls. Yes, I like boys. Yes, I like boys who like boys; I like girls who wear toys and girls who don\u2019t; girls who don\u2019t call themselves girls; crew cuts or curls and that really bad hair phase in between. I like steam rising from the body of a one-night stand; I like holding hands for three months before kissing; I like wishing your body was Saturn, my body thousand rings wrapped around you. You wanted to be a Buddhist nun once; last night you held my cervix between your fingers. I thank gods I don\u2019t believe in for your changing. Tell me we\u2019ll be naming our children \u201cBeautiful\u201d and nothing else. Tell Barbie she can go now. Tell GI Joe to put his gun down and find a boyfriend or a girlfriend or a girl-boy-friend; fuck it, y\u2019all, GI Joe just needs a friend. I mean, he\u2019s plastic and not even the kind of plastic that bends. I want to bend in a thousand directions like the sun does, like love does, like time stopped so the hands of the clock could hold each other; and we held each other like I held these words for too many years on the tip of my tongue. I am my mother\u2019s daughter. I am midnight sun. You can find me on the moon waxing and waning, my heart full of petals, every single one begging \u201clove me, love me, love me, whoever I am, whoever I become. Love me, love me, love me.\u201d \u2013Poem by Andrea Gibson", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 genderkid"}
