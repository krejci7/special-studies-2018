And last week I went to swimming pools on two succesive days: first with my closest friends and then to a larger pool party. Everybody knew I was female, but that didn\u2019t mean I was willing to don women\u2019s swimwear. Luckily, my body image isn\u2019t too bad. My biggest peeve concerns my hips and rear end, but I\u2019m ok as long as I don\u2019t look at them in the mirror. And I love my hairy calves, so I enjoy wearing shorts as long as my family isn\u2019t around: my lovely hirsute legs would disgust them. I rescued a pair of my dad\u2019s old swimming trunks, so dressing from the waist down was easy. That leaves the issue of what to do with The Chest. Looking back, the solution was easy: I only had to bring along an extra cotton bandage \u2014which is what I bind with\u2014 so I could change into it afterwards. That way I could just jump into the pool wearing a big old shirt without my lumpy chest showing. That would have been simple and perfect, although I never exercise while binding: it\u2019s unsafe and uncomfortable. Just chilling in the water would have been ok, probably. I didn\u2019t have enough time to buy a spare bandage, so I had to improvise. First came my friend\u2019s pool. Since I only had the bandage I was binding with, I took it off so it would stay dry and jumped in. I was fine while in the water, although when I got out my shirt clung to my body (wet t-shirt party, anyone?) The next day, at the pool party, I took my binder off again but I ended up staying in the shallow end, keeping my chest dry. Luckily, my shirt hid my breasts pretty well. I must have looked odd, though: my unsuspecting classmates kept offering me their extra bikini tops, which was kind but awkward. It\u2019s funny how clueless they are. I thought my binded chest and proud superhairy legs shouted \u201cMAN!\u201d Maybe they just shout \u201cliberated flat-chested woman.\u201d Or \u201cman who would wear a bikini.\u201d", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 genderkid"}
