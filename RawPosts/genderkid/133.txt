I don\u2019t know how the system works in other countries; but around here, the paperwork would take years. That is, if it\u2019s possible at all. There\u2019s this law that makes parents give their children \u201cproperly\u201d gendered names. Technically you could use an androgynous-sounding name, and you could even give a kid a name associated with the opposite sex. But in both cases, that name has to be complemented by another one that defines hir (biological) sex: hence Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 for a girl or Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda for a boy. (I like the how these really traditional combinations mix up genders, even if they don\u2019t question the binary.) I guess it\u2019s a cultural thing. Naming laws are made to protect kids\u2019 dignity, and maybe gender is so important in my culture that it would be an insult not to know someone\u2019s gender. So, I can\u2019t be legally called an androgynous name in any circumstances. And if I wanted a male name, I\u2019d have to go through sex-reassignment surgery \u2013which I don\u2019t want\u2013 and then prove myself man enough to deserve a legal sex change \u2013which I don\u2019t want either, and I don\u2019t think I would be macho enough to pass.", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 genderkid"}
