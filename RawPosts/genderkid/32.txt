It\u2019s true that now I don\u2019t have such an intense need to explore my identity through writing, but I still think a lot about gender, trans issues and transition, and blogging is a good way to discuss these ideas with you all. So I loved Jacky\u2019s proposal to take up WordPress\u2019s weekly post challenge. When I first started posting, I felt encouraged by several bloggers who were also exploring their identities or who were chronicling their transitions (Ryan, Jacky, Luke, Julian, Eliot, Joshua, Malcolm\u2026). Most of these people gradually stopped posting, and at the same time a vibrant trans community developed on Tumblr and Youtube. I wonder if everyone moved there; maybe there still are traditional blogs which are trans-oriented and active, and the reason I haven\u2019t found them is that I stopped looking. Either way, I wanted to thank Jacky for the nudge back to blogging. For me, it\u2019s one of the best ways to sort out my thoughts and challenge myself intellectually, and I get the same rewards from reading other people\u2019s posts. Expect posts on the language of transition, and top surgery, and why I no longer think I\u2019m femme. And, perhaps, the obligatory testosterone updates\u00a0 ;) Happy New Year to everyone who follows the Gregorian calendar!", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 genderkid"}
