I haven\u2019t found any blogs by Argentinean transmen; in the whole Spanish language, I found only one transmale blog by a guy from Spain. When I started this blog, I didn\u2019t know any transpeople in real life yet; I wanted to be part of some kind of community.\u00a0 I decided to write in English so I could share with all the people I\u2019ve mentioned and others I might have forgotten. The idea of having an English-language blog was also tempting because it\u2019s less likely to be found by people I know. Until this month, I hadn\u2019t shared it with any of my friends. It\u2019s easier to write about potentially embarrassing things if you\u2019re sure that your acquaintances won\u2019t find out \u2014 like the time I packed when I was 6 years old. But recently I realized that I\u2019m not embarrassed by anything I\u2019ve said so far. So last week I started a blog in Spanish and it\u2019s visible on my Facebook page. I want to come out to my schoolmates for once and for all so I can just get it over with. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good or efficient way of coming out, but I need to be comfortable at school. I hope some people, at least, will get the point and call me by my new name and pronouns.", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 genderkid"}
