Personal progress blogging blogs english gender language spanish transgender 
I started blogging inspired by all the awesome transmale blogs out there, like Tboy Jacky, Gender Outlaw, GenoTypo and Cheerful Megalomaniac; lesbian blogs like Sugarbutch and Lesbian Dad; and other gender blogs like Genderfork, My Life as a Drag King and Being a Teenage Crossdresser. I haven’t found any blogs by Argentinean transmen; in the whole Spanish language, I found only one transmale blog by a guy from Spain. When I started this blog, I didn’t know any transpeople in real life yet; I wanted to be part of some kind of community.  I decided to write in English so I could share with all the people I’ve mentioned and others I might have forgotten. The idea of having an English-language blog was also tempting because it’s less likely to be found by people I know. Until this month, I hadn’t shared it with any of my friends. It’s easier to write about potentially embarrassing things if you’re sure that your acquaintances won’t find out — like the time I packed when I was 6 years old. But recently I realized that I’m not embarrassed by anything I’ve said so far. So last week I started a blog in Spanish and it’s visible on my Facebook page. I want to come out to my schoolmates for once and for all so I can just get it over with. I don’t know if it’s a good or efficient way of coming out, but I need to be comfortable at school. I hope some people, at least, will get the point and call me by my new name and pronouns.
