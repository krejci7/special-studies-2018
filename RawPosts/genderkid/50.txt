Girl becomes Boy. Girl and Boy become a band. Meet COYOTE GRACE.\u201d I just found out about the band Coyote Grace \u2014 I loved the song \u201cA Guy Named Joe\u201d.\u00a0 A lot of their lyrics are about being trans: isn\u2019t that neat? Music can express universal emotions, but there are certain experiences that most people just don\u2019t have. It\u2019s nice to see one\u2019s life reflected in a song every once in a while: I am a self-made man, born with my two hands I been waiting for so long to finally stand But I have no history, one day I just came to be I barely know who I am \u2014Ghost Boy  (lyrics for A Guy Named Joe) I also liked the words to \u201cDaughterson\u201d \u2014 the title announces great things, and the first stanza is the perfect trans kid\u2019s rant: My haircut don\u2019t look right, my clothes don\u2019t fit just right, them boy clothes are too big and the girls\u2019 too tight. My feet, they look too small, and I ain\u2019t very tall, I fight with my mom every time I go to the mall. I couldn\u2019t find the lyrics anywhere, so I transcribed them (although there were a few lines I couldn\u2019t catch). The video and transcription, after the jump.  Daughterson by Coyote Grace My haircut don\u2019t look right, my clothes don\u2019t fit just right, them boy clothes are too big and the girls\u2019 too tight. My feet, they look too small, and I ain\u2019t very tall, I fight with my mom every time I go to the mall. If I can\u2019t be your daughterson, I ain\u2019t nothing at all. \u2026. Kids won\u2019t leave me and my queenie brother alone. I don\u2019t get picked to be on teams, oh I am scrappy and I\u2019m mean, Those girls seem to look right through me. My body has betrayed me, my life is so upsetting. If I had only known about those girls, they saw me all right. But I\u2019m obviously a man, but I sit down on the can, I get shots on the leg by my lady\u2019s loving hand. I got scars across my chest, Dr Brownstein is the best, Ain\u2019t no one can make me wear a dress. Well, just because I\u2019ve done this doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve got to do this too. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like, now do you? Well, I think there\u2019s a few of you that do. You say I\u2019m going to hell, well I\u2019ve been down that well, And God is a big boy, he can judge people himself. \u201cDon\u2019t mess with God\u2019s design\u201d, well, where do you draw the line? How \u2018bout botox, fat pills, warfare, deforestation, laser hair removal, the death penalty\u2026 Well, I think I\u2019m doing fine. Well, you\u2019re so scared of everything\u2026 And who are you to force me to believe what you think Jesus meant? I grew up under blue skies; the pain has made me wise. My body is my home, I won\u2019t ever be alone, I\u2019ve found my place behind this microphone. Well, I have chose my consequence, I have chosen my name. And I can be your daughterson, \u2019cause they\u2019re one and the same.", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 genderkid"}
