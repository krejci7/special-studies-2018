If each option were a computer bit, it would take 116 bytes to encode a combination.\u201d Wow. And this is just a small selection of all the possible ways we can identify; I identify as \u201cnon-binary\u201d, for instance, and I bet you can think of other gender words that represent you. Plus, there are hundreds of cultures with words and genders that don\u2019t exactly translate as \u201cman\u201d or \u201cwoman\u201d, so there\u2019s an infinite number of ways to define ourselves. Too bad most people only identifies as one of the culturally-sanctioned genders. This site made me think about how our gender identity blends with the rest of our identity. I wondered why there were checkboxes for things like personality and political affiliation; but then orientation/affection isn\u2019t strictly about gender either, and I tend to lump them together, saying I\u2019m a queer transboy (the \u201cqueer\u201d part is important to me: it defines my non-binary mindset). I guess the author thinks of us as whole human beings who can\u2019t be split into different categories so easily: \u201cAlthough I really wanted the words to stand for themselves, without tainting them by splitting them up, with 925 options that\u2019s not really plausible. So I have categorized them into groups. Like any other classification system, this is completely arbitrary. You can still view one long list if you like\u2026\u201d Hat-tip to Meitar Moscovitz, who commented about this site on Genderfork. Thanks, Meitar!", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 genderkid"}
