Oh yeah! Also, check out the International Bill of Gender Rights: The IBGR is a theoretical construction which has no force of law\u2026 However, individuals are free to adopt the truths and principles expressed in the IBGR, and to lead their lives accordingly.\u00a0 In this fashion, the truths expressed in the IBGR will liberate and empower humankind in ways and to an extent beyond the reach of legislators, judges, officials and diplomats. It lists rights for everyone \u2013not only trans people\u2013, including the right to define gender identity and express it freely, employment issues, body modification, medical care, having children, and sexual expression.
