I love his work since I heard Mourner\u2019s Prayer, an intense poem about transition, spirituality and family. Later I discovered that he has many funny pieces, too, like Fagette and Tranny Got Pack (\u201cI like to pack and I cannot lie!\u201d). I think you\u2019ll enjoy his work, too:  (lyrics for Fagette here) Mourner\u2019s Prayer, in particular, keeps drawing me to hear it again. The Hebrew chants interspersed throughout the poem haunt me -in a nice way- even though I\u2019m agnostic. Katz said: \u201cIn it, I realized that there was a moment where I started to love myself. And I know that seems so loo-loo and New Age. But at the same time, it\u2019s a revolutionary thought to have when you\u2019ve spent your whole life not loving yourself. That changed me and how I write.\u201d  I couldn\u2019t find any lyrics for this; my transcription, after the jump. Mourner\u2019s Prayer by Harvey Katz  Across the bridge, there are a million lights and night rider I\u2019m driving, New York City on my right. Steering wheel in my hand, journal tight to my thigh and that seventy-miles-an-hour highway line\u2019s hypnotized. And meditative thoughts materialize where I\u2019m chugging along the interstates, paraded by inquisitive nouns looking cock-eyed and inquisitive towns and wonder what this countrified city boy hides. And this time, it\u2019s Raleigh to DC, New York and Philly; a love-seat on Monday; a pull-out couch on Tuesday. And on days this gray, I fold into myself like clovers after dusk; and on days this cold, I wonder what the road holds. I could beat a concept of home and I say the mourner\u2019s prayer almost without thinking: Yisgadal v\u2019yiskadash sh\u2019mei rabbaw. Yes, I do believe in God; and no, this isn\u2019t Columbine, I\u2019m not answering with my life on the line but when a student asked me this question, \u201cdo you believe in God?,\u201d after an hour-long Trans 101 lesson, she was looking for a life line. \u2018Cause her whole lifetime, she believed in water into wine, dying for your sins and walking on liquid; and here I was, taking Adam\u2019s rib and turning it into something she had to question. Yisgadal v\u2019yiskadash sh\u2019mei rabbaw. Your (Hebrew). The loss of a daughter without gaining a son; and like \u201cwouldn\u2019t it just, like, be easier if you just sort of, like, picked one?\u201d For you? Well, probably; but for me, it\u2019s all speculatory; for my family, yes. See, yesterday, I cut off the last parts of me recognizable in my mother\u2019s silhouette; a pound and a half of flesh, and tomorrow yesterday\u2019s trash; and I\u2019m a little bit regret, and a little bit happiness. Witness self-hate. Witness mutation. Witness my father\u2019s even breath breaking into hysteria and negotiation. Witness, witness awakening. See, I went to sleep proud and woke up feeling like a sell-out, like I\u2019m fucking the binary, like I\u2019m putting out for a system that would put up with me. Like now, I\u2019m part of this silent hierarchy settled for those who have transitioned medically. And really, well, that\u2019s not how I feel at all, so I\u2019m calling on this community to commute; to move past passing judgement \u2019cause it was twenty-six years before I saw anything beautiful in me. Twenty-six years, each with 365 days, and between, nearly ten thousand dawns of dysphoria; of waking under waterfalls, waiting to be washed clean, or carried off. And we are eighty percent water: fluidity seems only natural to change state into birthright. Isn\u2019t that what we\u2019re taught? That energy is neither gain nor loss; from lava to mountain; from fire to rock\u2026 Yisgadal v\u2019yiskadash sh\u2019mei rabbaw. Sit out parts in the highway; where exits grow so far apart that what is conceptually just a little ways to go becomes fifty miles of road between you and your goal.\u00a0Yisgadal v\u2019yiskadash sh\u2019mei rabbaw. It is a conversational prayer: the service leader says one thing and the congregation answers: v\u2019yispaw\u2019ar, v\u2019yisromam, v\u2019yis\u2019nasei. It\u2019s a dialogue for a pair; patchwork on asphalt; tar snakes are making peace. See, across the bridge, there are a million lights and night rider I\u2019m driving, hoping instinct brings me to insight.", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 genderkid"}
