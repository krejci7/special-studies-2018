A law for full marriage equality had already been approved by one House/Chamber, and that day it was to be discussed in the Senate. A friend and I joined the crowd in front of the Legislative Palace, showing support and listening with bated breath to the discussion, which was being broadcast onto a screen. Everyone seemed to be there: all the LGBT organizations, of course, but also worker\u2019s unions, social justice/human rights organizations, banners of support from political parties\u2026 Yes, I was annoyed that they hadn\u2019t stood for LGB rights before it was a popular issue, but mostly I felt joy to see so many people there. Especially because \u2013ever since it had become a visible topic of debate\u2013 anti-gay graffitis and stickers had shown up everywhere, even near my home. It was a very cold winter day, but it felt warmer there in the crowd. But, for me, the most stunning thing of the day happened back at school. My friend and I only stayed at the Congress for a little while because my school was also in turmoil: a huge decision had been made, most students and teachers were against it, and debates and demonstrations were being held back-to-back. When we returned from the Senate, a rally was being held around the school door: people were chanting and even dancing in a mosh pit. The main demand was greater in-school democracy. I heard a snatch of a new chant, and though I couldn\u2019t make out the words, I clearly recognized the word \u201chomosexual\u201d. I frowned: were they using \u201cgay\u201d to insult an authority figure?\u00a0 No, it was something about gay marriage \u2014 it was asking for gay marriage! \u00a1O-l\u00e9-l\u00e9, o-l\u00e1-l\u00e1, democratizaci\u00f3n, matrimonio homosexual! The song demanded both school democratization and gay marriage! And ALL the kids were singing it, and MOSHING to it! I still get goosebumps when I remember that moment. It was so beautiful to see 12-to-18-year-olds dancing for gay rights. I realized that it didn\u2019t matter if the bill didn\u2019t pass this time: it was bound to, soon. The biggest challenge \u2013changing people\u2019s minds\u2013 had been overcome, and even if Congress members were unwilling to recognize it, they couldn\u2019t stop the course of history. The law did pass, just before dawn. I woke to an ecstatic text message announcing the news, and when I reached school, half-running in excitement, a straight friend picked me clean off the ground and whirled me around in a circle, both of us shouting with joy. The trans bills I mentioned haven\u2019t been discussed in Congress yet, and I  wonder if \u2013when the date draws near\u2013 trans issues will be discussed  to such an extent. It\u2019s urgently needed, because transphobia is even more rampant than homophobia. I hope that, in a few months, I can tell a similar story about the day trans people are granted our rights.", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 genderkid"}
