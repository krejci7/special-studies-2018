Genders in everyday life Names dog dogs female to male FTM pet pets trans transboy transexual transgender transition transmale transman transsexual 
I’m back! Here’s a short, light post while I gather my thoughts. I wonder how pets deal with transition. Taking hormones is like going through puberty, so they should keep recognizing the transitioning person if ze stayed at home, gradually changing. But what if I manage to move out when I start T, and I only visit occasionally? Will my dog still know who I am? Plus, getting hir used to my new name would be tough. How did you all deal with your pets? PS: if you’re near Hampshire College in Amherst, MA (US), in April, you might be interested in a conference that Helyx is working on: “Want to explore the intersection of queer identity, reproductive justice, sexuality and gender?” More info here.
