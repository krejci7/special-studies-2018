It\u2019 about how gender \u2013femininity\u2013 is constructed and imposed on women (specifically, non-white females in the US): \u201c\u2026makeup\u2019s just an anglicized, colonized, commodified utility that my sisters have been programmed to consume, forcing them to cover up their natural state in order to imitate what another sister looks like in her natural state because people keep telling her that the other sister\u2019s natural state is more beautiful than the first sister\u2019s natural state. At the same time, the other sister isn\u2019t even in her natural state, because she\u2019s trying to imitate yet another sister, so in actuality, the natural state that the first sister\u2019s trying to imitate wasn\u2019t even natural in the first place.\u201d This reminds me of queer theory and how genders can be thought of as copies; copies with no original. It\u2019s also interesting to hear the feelings of the guy who\u2019s hitting on her: \u201c\u2026in the presence of this higher being, the weakness of my masculinity kicks in, causing me to personify my wannabe big-baller, shot-caller, God\u2019s gift to the female species\u2026\u201d  Transcription, found here, after the cut. Slip of the Tongue by Adriel Luis My glares burn through her. And I\u2019m sure that such actions aren\u2019t foreign to her because the essence of her beauty is, well, the essence of beauty. And in the presence of this higher being, the weakness of my masculinity kicks in, causing me to personify my wannabe big-baller, shot-caller, God\u2019s gift to the female species with shiny suit wrapping rapping like, \u201cYo, what\u2019s crackin shorty how you livin\u2019 what\u2019s your sign what\u2019s your size I dig your style, yo.\u201d Now, this girl was no fool. She gives me a dirty look with the quickness like, \u201cBoy, you must be stupid.\u201d so I\u2019m looking at myself, \u201cBoy, you must be stupid.\u201d But looking upon her I am kinda feelin\u2019 her style. So I try again. But, instead of addressing her properly, I blurt out one of my fake-ass playalistic lines like, \u201cGurl, you must be a traffic ticket cuz you got fine written all over you.\u201d Now, she\u2019s trying to leave and I\u2019m trying to keep her here. So at a final attempt, I utter, \u201cGurl, what is your ethnic makeup?\u201d At this point, her glare was scorching through me, and somehow she manages to make her brown eyes resemble some kinda brown fire or something, but there\u2019s no snap or head moement, no palm to face, click of tongue, middle finger, roll of eyes, twist of lips, or girl power chant. She just glares through me with these burning eyes and her gaze grabs you by the throat. She says, \u201cEthnic makeup?\u201d She says, \u201cFirst of all, makeup\u2019s just an anglicized, colonized, commodified utility that my sisters have been programmed to consume, forcing them to cover up their natural state in order to imitate what another sister looks like in her natural state because people keep telling her that the other sister\u2019s natural state is more beautiful than the first sister\u2019s natural state. At the same time, the other sister isn\u2019t even in her natural state, because she\u2019s trying to imitate yet another sister, so in actuality, the natural state that the first sister\u2019s trying to imitate wasn\u2019t even natural in the first place.\u201d Now I\u2019m thinking, \u201cDamn, this girl\u2019s kicking knowledge!\u201d But, meanwhile, she keeps spitting on it like \u201cFine. I\u2019ll tell you bout my \u2018ethnic makeup.\u2019 I wear foundation, not that powdery shit, I wear the foundation laid by my indigenous people. It\u2019s that foundation that makes it so that past being globalized, I can still vocalize with confidence that i know where my roots are. I wear this foundation not upon my face, but within my soul, and I take this from my ancestors because I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019d ever let an American or European corporation tell me what my foundation should look like.\u201d I wear lipstick, for my lips stick to the ears of men, so they can experience in surround sound my screams of agony with each lash of rulers, measuring tape, and scales, as if my waistline and weight are inversely propotional to my value as a human being. See my lips, they stick, but not together. Rather, they flail open with flames to burn down this culture that once kept them shut. Now, I mess with eye shadow, but my eyes shadow over this time where you\u2019ve gone at ends to keep me blind. But you can\u2019t cover my eyes, look into them. My eyes foreshadow change. My eyes foreshadow light. and I\u2019m not into hair dyeing. but I\u2019m here, dying, because this oppression won\u2019t get out of my hair. I have these highlights. They are highlights of my past atrocities, they form this oppression I can\u2019t wash off. It tangles around my mind and twists and braids me in layers, this oppression manifests, it\u2019s stressing me so that even though I don\u2019t color my hair, in a couple of years it\u2019ll look like I dyed it gray. So what\u2019s my ethnic makeup ? I don\u2019t have any. Because your ethnicity isn\u2019t something you can just make up. And as for that crap my sisters paint on their faces, that\u2019s not makeup, it\u2019s make-believe.\u201d I can\u2019t seem to look up at her. and I\u2019m sure that such actions aren\u2019t foreign to her because the expression on her face shows that she knows that my mind is in a trance. As her footsteps fade, my ego is left in crutches. And rejection never sounded so sweet. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 * \u201cFor Butler, \u2018successful\u2019 genders are those that cite other earlier examples. Thus we learn to become men and women and to be recognized as such by copying other examples. (\u2026) if gender is always an artifice that copies something else, then all gender is a reuse of familiar stereotypes (\u2026). All gender is drag.\u201d \u2014 Wilchins, Riki.
