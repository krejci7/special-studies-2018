Celebration buenos aires FTM gay pride lgbt pride march queer pride transboy transgender 
Yesterday was LGBT-etcetera PRIDE! Pride March (image by Thomas Hobbes)  I met another transboy, in person, for the first time. I helped hand out pink balloons. I talked to several queer groups about joining forces to promote LGBT visibility in my school. I recieved 13 condoms and 20 lubricants from several different volunteers, including retired people! I fled from dozens of cameras at first, but then I realized that if my family saw me being so happy, they couldn’t be mad. Tango!
