Pride March (image by Thomas Hobbes)  I met another transboy, in person, for the first time. I helped hand out pink balloons. I talked to several queer groups about joining forces to promote LGBT visibility in my school. I recieved 13 condoms and 20 lubricants from several different volunteers, including retired people! I fled from dozens of cameras at first, but then I realized that if my family saw me being so happy, they couldn\u2019t be mad. Tango! (image by Thomas Hobbes) I\u2019m swamped in schoolwork right now, but I have lots to write about later. Hope you\u2019re all well!", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 genderkid"}
