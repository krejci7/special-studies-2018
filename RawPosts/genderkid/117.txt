For different cultural reasons*, it\u2019s hard to exchange presents down here; so the pajamas are still in my room, haunting me. This weekend, I got two more belated gifts.\u00a0 One family member gave me a third set of sleepwear, only this time it was a nightgown. A pink nightgown. Plus, my parents invaded my room while I was out: they installed a full-length mirror in my closet. I think I look fine from the shoulders up, but I keenly avoid looking at my chest and hips and girly behind. Thanks, mom and dad, for reminding me I\u2019m female. I\u2019ve been trying to think of worse gifts for a transman but I couldn\u2019t come up with much. I could\u2019ve recieved makeup (which could be used for face-painting, at least), lacey underwear (got that last year), a book on being a Real Woman (which might be sociologically interesting, albeit appaling), or a purse. At first, I felt guilty because these people spent \u2013wasted\u2013 money on me with their best intentions in mind. I might have appreciated the presents had I been different \u2014 that is, cisgender. I wasn\u2019t sad about not getting things I liked; I hope I\u2019m never that materialistic. I just wish people would stop buying me identity-denying gifts which leave me sorry for the giver and make me feel invisible. I wish people would stop giving me presents at all. No, wait \u2014 I wish my old friends would call me \u201che\u201d ; that would be the best gift ever. Now I can laugh at my sheer bad luck. I mean, three sets of pink pajamas? What are the odds?! \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 *In Argentina, stores don\u2019t give you your money back. Both pairs of pajamas were bought in \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d stores, so I\u2019d only exchange one girly thing for another. Plus, I\u2019m not sure where these people shopped, and I don\u2019t really want to ask.", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 genderkid"}
