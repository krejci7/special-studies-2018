I don\u2019t usually like being in the presence of people who tolerate me as if I were a nuisance they\u2019re kind enough to bear. I demand respect. And if possible, I\u2019d like people to enjoy my company. Maybe even desire me. (According to definr, to tolerate is \u201cto put up with something or somebody unpleasant\u201d; although one definition of tolerance is \u201cwillingness to recognize and respect the beliefs or practices of others\u201d) During my school\u2019s Queer Arts Festival, there was a play that ended with the actors unfolding a huge banner with this phrase on it, while they sang a translation of Kimya Dawson\u2019s Loose Lips. Strong combination:  \u201cWe won\u2019t stop until somebody calls the cops/ and even then we\u2019ll start again and just pretend that / nothing ever happened\u201d and \u201cIf you want to burn yourself, remember that I love you / If you want to cut yourself, remember that I love you / If you want to kill yourself, remember that I love you / Call me up before you\u2019re dead, we can make some plans instead / Send me an IM, I\u2019ll be your friend.\u201d", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 genderkid"}
