I have experimented with lowering my tone at home, speaking into a microphone; but when I actually talk with someone, I\u2019d rather let the conversation flow naturally. I prefer to concentrate on what I say instead of how squeaky I sound, even if that entails being seen as female. Maybe, if my voice were the only thing in the way of \u201cpassing\u201d, I\u2019d pay more attention to it. As it is, I\u2019m usually seen as male anyway, unless the other person already knows me well. Or maybe I just don\u2019t care so much; maybe I care more about establishing a connection with the person I\u2019m talking to, a connection that goes beyond how I\u2019m gendered. As Clare Howell wrote in GenderQueer, \u201c\u2026I make little effort to present either a feminine or masculine appearance. I lived half a lifetime creating the caricature of a man and have no interest in spending the other half doing \u2018woman\u2019.\u201d* That doesn\u2019t mean I like my voice; I remember being horrified when I first heard a recording of myself in the 6th grade. It\u2019ll be awesome to hear it change when I\u2019m on testosterone. Maybe I\u2019m just lazy; but for now, other things seem more important than getting a lower voice. * \u201cCaricature\u201d doesn\u2019t seem the best term for modifying one\u2019s presentation; I guess she means \u201ctrying too hard to pass by pretending to be someone you\u2019re not.\u201d I don\u2019t think a transwoman would want to ridicule transpeople!
