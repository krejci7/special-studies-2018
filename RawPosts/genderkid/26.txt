Like in periareolar or keyhole, an incision is made around the areola (all the way around or just half a circle, depending on the case); but in this method, there are two extra scars extending horizontally from the areola which allow extra skin to be taken out. I was super excited to find someone who performs this surgery because I was nervous about having too much extra skin for periareolar. Although I\u2019ve seen excellent results from peri \u2013even on medium-sized breasts\u2013 and it\u2019s been recommended for my chest, I only know one person who underwent this surgery in Argentina and he ended up with stretched-out areolas. I was okay with that at the time \u2013and it\u2019s only a possibility, not a certainty\u2013 but the extended method would avoid that risk. And you get UFO shaped scars! Fun! There\u2019s very little info online that I could find. I learned about the technique thanks to Travis, who has a very clear explanation video (here\u2019s a slideshow video of his chest healing). He\u2019s the one who calls it the \u201cspaceship\u201d or \u201cLondon underground\u201d surgery due to the shape of the scars. The article \u201cMastectomy in Female-to-male Transsexuals\u201d by Namba, Watanabe and Kimata explains the procedure and who it\u2019s recommended for (warning: black-and white images of surgery being performed). Finally, the article \u201cChest-Wall Contouring Surgery in Female-to-Male Transsexuals: A New Algorithm\u201d compares the outcome of five types of mastectomy \u2013including extended peri\u2013 performed on 92 people and concludes which type is best for each case. I love that this article includes before and after pictures (and diagrams) of each procedure, without showing anything graphic. Two fun facts about this technique: it was invented in the 1930s and  it\u2019s called the Moguilevsky method (according to the surgeon, at least; I  couldn\u2019t find any source to point y\u2019all to). The downside to extended peri? The last article I linked found that it had the highest rate of complications and revisions, along with the lowest satisfaction rating. And since there are very few images available, I\u2019m not sure what to expect.\u00a0 Please let me know if you\u2019ve heard more about this procedure; it still seems like a good option. Edit: I found an assortment of materials from Australia, where this operation is fairly common. Here\u2019s some pictures and a whole bunch of videos showing the results. it had the highest revisional rate (60 percent) and the lowest overall satisfaction rating (3.6 of 5) by both patient and surgeon", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 genderkid"}
