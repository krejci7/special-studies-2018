I needed to get a new prescription from my doctor, and went later than I should have (it was exam season); then I discovered that my insurance would cover part of the cost (yay!), and the paperwork took some time. I noticed some people wondering what would happen if they skipped an injection or two, and I wanted to share my experience. What happened to me might not happen to everyone \u2013I had been on T for only four months, and not everyone\u2019s body works the same way\u2013 but I thought it was worth telling. My body told me it was time for my next shot before I had even checked the calendar. It was the last week of school and despite being excited, I felt I lacked physical energy. I also had no appetite and started skipping meals, but I didn\u2019t know if these things were due to my hormone levels or to the intense summer heat. I only confirmed that it was hormone-related when I re-started T and began to enjoy food and exercise again. These changes (or reversal of changes) were only mildly disappointing, but I felt really frustrated that my voice was going back. I don\u2019t think it happened to my average speaking voice, but before stopping I had been pushing into a lower, more resounding range \u2013especially when I sang\u2013 and I couldn\u2019t reach that anymore. I did regain the ability to sing higher. I had mourned the loss of that ability, but losing my new lower voice felt worse (so now I know that losing a high voice was worth it). What really scared me was the prospect of getting a period (I had my last one two days after starting T). Towards the end of my no-T interval I had dreams that I was menstruating, and that freaked me out because I used to have those dreams immediately before actually getting a period. I was lucky, though, and it didn\u2019t happen. Although I\u2019m frustrated to have gone backwards with my transition \u2013now, three weeks after a shot, I\u2019ve only just regained the changes I\u2019d experienced\u2013 I appreciate the opportunity I had to rethink and confirm my decision. I am more certain than ever that this is the right choice for me, at least for now.", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 genderkid"}
