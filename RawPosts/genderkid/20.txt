I wasn\u2019t so nervous going in as I had expected, there were no complications, and \u2013although the first days were rougher than I\u2019d anticipated\u2013 I\u2019m now feeling almost back to normal. There\u2019s a lot of text (and video) online about recovering from top surgery, so I won\u2019t delay you with the whole story here, although I\u2019m open to any questions you may have. I do want to mention a few things that my surgeon did differently from doctors in other countries, or even other surgeons I met here, besides the unusual technique:  He didn\u2019t leave any drains in my chest, which was great for my comfort and squeamishness (I hadn\u2019t heard about top surgery without them, so I was wary at first, but ultimately I trusted his judgment). On the third day he covered my wounds with tegaderm, which is a waterproof dressing, so I could take showers (but the idea of water hitting my chest still terrifies me, so I\u2019ve been taking tub/washcloth baths). He does all his wound care himself, twice a week, which is great because (1) I\u2019m squeamish, (2) I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s done properly, and (3) he can control the wounds\u2019 progress often.  I\u2019m very happy with my chest, even though I haven\u2019t seen it completely: my nipples/incisions are covered with gauze and I\u2019ve decided not to look until the stitches come out. I still have a lot of swelling, but the relative flatness is nice. I thought that, at first, I\u2019d miss the volume that I lost from my chest, seeing as I\u2019d lived with it for so long (I\u2019m prone to nostalgia, even for the bad things in my life). I thought that I\u2019d have to get used to the flatness, despite having wanted it for so long; but when I looked down at my  chest after surgery, it just made sense. I think it\u2019ll be harder to grow accustomed to my scars and the new placement of my nipples. I\u2019d always seen myself, in my mind, as having a flat chest; and I\u2019d even seen it in real life, thanks to binding. But it was harder to picture exactly where my nipples would be, their size, or what my scars would look like, so I expect all of that to look foreign to me at first. That\u2019s another reason why I haven\u2019t looked under the gauze yet: so I can get to know my chest slowly. I feel very grateful towards my parents, who have been taking care of me during my recovery. They don\u2019t know about this blog, but still: \u00a1gracias, mami y papi!", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 genderkid"}
