I wonder why I\u2019ve never talked about this yet, considering the huge amounts of time I\u2019ve spent pondering just what the signs mean by \u201cmen\u201d and \u201cwomen\u201d. Do they mean my body? my desired body? my gender? They should set up a restroom for \u201cqueers\u201d *. But seriously: I hate having to decide whether or not I\u2019m a \u201cman\u201d every time I need a bathroom. I\u2019ve been avoiding public restrooms for several months. I started getting stared at in the ladies\u2019 last year, even though I didn\u2019t identify as trans yet. I found it funny at first, then annoying, but I felt I had a \u201cright\u201d to be in there; if anyone asked, I just said \u201cI\u2019m a girl\u201d and stuck my chest out to prove it. Now, I feel personally uncomfortable in the women\u2019s: I really don\u2019t want to say \u201cI\u2019m a girl\u201d (I\u2019m a boy!), plus I feel I\u2019m invading women\u2019s space. But I still go there: \u2013if I\u2019m not \u201cpassing\u201d well as a dude \u2013if I might run into someone I know (like at school, where people think I\u2019m a girl) \u2013if I\u2019m with my friends-who-are-girls. Actually, I\u2019ve only gone to the men\u2019s room twice, both times at fast-food restaurants. The first time, it was empty, so I got to look around; the walls looked dirtier, but the rest was pretty much the same as the ladies\u2019 \u2014 oh yeah, except for the urinal.  The second time was kinda funny. I went in and nearly bumped into the guys, it was so full. I was completely disoriented \u2014 there were lavatories, and there was a wall, so where was the rest? I peeked around the wall and, oops, I was looking at the backs of peeing dudes, therefore breaking Rule #1 of male-bathroomhood. I also found the stalls behind that wall, but they seemed to be occupied. Since it was my lucky day, a restaurant employee happened to be in the room, and he asked me if I was waiting for a urinal. Uh-oh! My voice is too high to pass! I think I grunted and pointed at the stalls, and he showed me an empty one. Luckily, my feet weren\u2019t visible from outside the stall, so I didn\u2019t have to worry about my feet pointing the wrong way. I\u2019ve changed so much \u2013physically\u2013 in the past week: I cut my hair (yay!) and I started binding (yay!). I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be allowed in the women\u2019s room anymore. But the men\u2019s room is fine for me. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- PS: I love the short documentary Wrong Bathroom about this exact issue. * I know, lots of queers do consider themselves men or women (although even these people may get harassed in men\u2019s/women\u2019s rooms).", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 genderkid"}
