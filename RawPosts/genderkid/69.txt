I\u2019m almost as tall as the average girl \u20131.60m or 5\u2032 3\u201d\u2013, which makes me shorter than almost all the men I know. I don\u2019t really mind \u2013I don\u2019t feel inferior because of my height or anything; I hardly even think about that\u2013 but maybe it would be easier if I were a little taller. I could find pants that actually fit, for instance. What does annoy me is people\u2019s attitudes towards short guys. I have a very short classmate and people are always teasing him about his height, while they don\u2019t usually say anything about short girls. And whenever my friends are talking about the kind of men they like, they all agree that short guys aren\u2019t attractive. I don\u2019t think I can criticize their tastes, but I think it\u2019s disrespectful to say that when I\u2019m RIGHT THERE (they tend to forget I\u2019m a boy). Actually, I can\u2019t think of many advantages that come from being tall; maybe reaching high shelves, but you can use steps for that. And I never had trouble with my height as a girl. But sometimes\u00a0 feel hurried to take testosterone because if I start before the end of puberty, I might grow a little (I checked a biology textbook that said bone growth might continue until age 20). I don\u2019t know if I need that, but I know I wouldn\u2019t mind; and I don\u2019t want to regret missing out on this possibility. What would be great about growing is that my hips might narrow. The biology books I consulted say that estrogen makes hip bones grow wider (T does the same for the shoulders), so if T made me grow, maybe my hips would end up growing less than the rest of me. I\u2019m usually more or less tolerant of my body, but I do not like having wide hips AT ALL. Anyway, my hips will look narrower with T because of the fat loss. I also heard that testosterone has better effects if taken early, but I haven\u2019t found much information about that. It seems to have great results at all ages; Gender Outlaw started as an adult and his feet grew, which would be useful for me (I never find men\u2019s shoes in my size). I should ask Julian in a few months; he\u2019s 18 and just started T. This kind of info is very important for deciding when to come out to my parents, so I\u2019m still researching it. I plan on telling my parents when I finish this school year, soon after turning 18, and I hoped to start T a few months later; but my psychologist thinks they will need a whole year to digest the information, so I should delay starting T. If that might mean missing the opportunity of having a body that\u2019s better for me, I don\u2019t know if I can wait. An alternative would be to tell them now and risk becoming an emotional mess in the middle of the school year, just so I can start T earlier. I\u2019m trying to decide what my priorities are.", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 genderkid"}
