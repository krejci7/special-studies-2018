Most parents gender them like heck even before they\u2019re born \u2014 they ask the doctor what sex the baby is, buy stuff accordingly, paint the room pink or blue. But then those same kids equal gender with small details, and not with body types. Or at least that\u2019s my conclusion after a couple of incidents: Whenever I go out with my parents, I try to look as much as a girl as possible, so people will read me as female. And, when these two incidents happened, I still had long hair. Both situations were almost the same: we were at the house of my parents\u2019 friends, and the kid of the family pulled me down to their height. \u201cAre you a boy or a girl?\u201d they each whispered into my ear. \u201cI\u2019m a girl.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d Pause. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t you wearing earrings?\u201d or, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing a dress?\u201d I think I could have answered \u201cI\u2019m a boy\u201d to these kids, and they would have totally gotten it. Well, not totally, but they wouldn\u2019t have asked about my body parts, and they didn\u2019t even care if I had a girl-name. Their attitude was nice and simple: they didn\u2019t know my gender, so they asked. They didn\u2019t get offended, and they didn\u2019t offend me. Another issue that interests me is how parents deal with gendering their kids, especially when the parents are cool and totally gender-savvy. The problem is, how is the rest of the world going to treat non-stereotypically-gendered children? I don\u2019t know too much about kids, but several writers have tackled this issue:  Blue milk (a mother) has recent posts about three-year-olds discussing queer politics and pink for boys. There\u2019s this post about letting a son wear pink. Theorist Judith \u201cJack\u201d Halberstam \u2013heart!\u2013 talks about the problem of gendering kids. For a feminist twist: I Sing Like A Girl. My Life as a Drag King\u2019s take (and here, too). And last but never least, Lesbian Dad with Terms of engenderment, or The \u201cbuddy\u201d question. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 PS: a couple of scientific studies on kids and gender: Difference Blog on how children associate gender with height.
