What a relief. I didn\u2019t get around to proactively enforcing my name, so I\u2019m not sure what happened. Maybe one of my friends realized I was upset about this issue and she asked people to please respect my gender. Or maybe it was bound to happen eventually, once I reached the critical mass of people who use the right name. It\u2019s contagious! Seriously, though, I think people feel less awkward if others are also using my new name. In any case, I feel grateful. Now I\u2019ve encountered a new challenge. After years of practice, I got so used to interacting with my classmates from a defensive place that now I don\u2019t really know how to act. I\u2019m not complaining, and I certainly don\u2019t want to go back to a gender-hurtful situation; I just need to relearn how to open up a little with this set of people. I\u2019ve spent almost five years with them, and some are really nice; it seems worth a shot. I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m experiencing this now, right when I\u2019m ending one stage of my life. Even if I can never overcome the safe distance I\u2019ve placed between my classmates and me, it won\u2019t be a big deal: I\u2019ll be moving on to college soon. It\u2019s a chance to start over. I\u2019ve read several trans people\u2019s stories of feeling empty when they \u201cfinish\u201d transitioning: when they\u2019re satisfied with their bodies, everyone respects their names and pronouns, and gender ceases to be a huge issue (even for people who consider transitioning to be a lifelong process). I think that by beginning my transition at this point, I might avoid some of that feeling. Since I\u2019m just starting to build my own life, I won\u2019t have to base my whole existence around feeling uncomfortable with myself. For instance, I like thinking about how society works. If I didn\u2019t have my gender issues at least half figured out, I might center my whole college education around gender, sex and sexuality. And when I sorted out my gender, then what would I have left? What would my aim in life be? I\u2019m still interested in sex and gender identities, but I don\u2019t feel such a tremendous need to study them anymore, now that I\u2019m pretty comfortable with myself. In college, I\u2019ll be able to find other subjects that interest me, too. It is a little confusing to deal with gender concerns while I\u2019m still dealing with other teen and coming-of-age stuff such as friends, parents, the future, newfound responsibility and independence. But it probably isn\u2019t much easier to transition later on, when one has to deal with work, aging parents, family, and possibly spouses and kids. Now, at least, I\u2019m allowed to make mistakes and redirect my life in accordance to my personal changes. People of all ages deserve to do this, but unfortunately older folks who do this might be frowned upon. Maybe I\u2019m just saying all of this because I don\u2019t know much about Life and Growing Up. I tend to think of college as a tumultuous time of rapid growth, change and discovery; it\u2019s hard for me to imagine feeling empty during those years. But I\u2019m sure that it depends on the person. Many trans people probably never feel a post-transition vacuity, and many people \u2013trans and no\u2013 experience emptiness for lots of different reasons. How did you feel after going through your gender process? Did you feel empty? Confused? Relieved?
