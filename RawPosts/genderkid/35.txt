They decided not to let me, even after a long discussion where we presented evidence that my request was, in fact, legal. I\u2019d found some legal documents in support of trans students; plus, I pointed out that some of my Asian classmates have chosen Spanish names which are listed alongside their legal names. Although their situation is different from mine, it proves that non-legal names are in fact routinely used. As an aside, I think the system is rigged to let teachers stay in their ethnocentric, ciscentric comfort zone: it\u2019s probably \u201ceasier\u201d for the teachers to use traditional Spanish names, whereas it\u2019s so hard to use the right pronouns when you know someone is trans! It\u2019s a reminder that apparently different oppressions are rooted in similar attitudes. Although I believe the decision was deeply unfair, and that I could have won the case if we had taken some sort of legal action, I\u2019m lucky that the school\u2019s head is surprisingly LGBTQ-friendly (unless, of course, she has to take a risky stand). She tried to find some other solution, and we finally agreed to have a meeting with my new professors before the beginning of the school year. My dad just got out of that meeting \u2013I wasn\u2019t invited\u2013 and called to say it went well. I\u2019ll ask about the details when he gets home. The idea of a whole meeting centered around me is really embarrassing, and I hope my professors aren\u2019t annoyed that they had to attend. But I guess it\u2019s better for them to hold a grudge against me than to be called by the wrong name for an entire school year, especially because \u2013for the first time in five years\u2013 I\u2019ll be having new classmates who won\u2019t necessarily know that they shouldn\u2019t use my legal name (during all of secondary school, I had the same 30-35 classmates in every single class because we all had to take the same subjects). Besides, I\u2019m trying not to feel too embarrassed about the meeting because it isn\u2019t really about me \u2014 it\u2019s about educating my teachers about how to treat a trans student, and why it matters (almost like \u201cdiversity training\u201d). For instance, my dad was going to tell them that \u2013even though I\u2019m very engaged with my studies\u2013 I often avoided participating in class in fear that the teacher would ask my name, or  to avoid hir from calling my name. Looking back, that was really hard because we often had awesome student teachers, the kind who get you really involved, and I did NOT want them to know my name \u2014 but I was bursting to join the discussion! All in all, I\u2019m glad that I got the principal\u2019s support; whatever my professors\u2019 attitudes, I won\u2019t have to wait in dread \u2013during the first week of school\u2013 until each new teacher pulls out their student list, and struggle to correct them \u2013in a terrified voice\u2013 in front of 35 other people. School starts on Monday, and I\u2019m really looking forward to it!", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 genderkid"}
