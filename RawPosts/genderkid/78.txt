I know that I started to transition because I couldn\u2019t stand being a girl any longer, but I tend to forget exactly how I felt back then; I have to trust that my old self made the right decision. Sometimes, though, I have to present as female and it all comes back to me. I don\u2019t like going out with my family, for instance, because I feel really confused and awkward when I\u2019m perceived as a woman; and I never know if I\u2019m passing as a girl, anyway. Today was my first gym class at school this year. I still wasn\u2019t sure which locker room to use; at the last moment, I went into the women\u2019s room with a friend. I kept hoping that no one would try to stop me: I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to justify myself confidently. To my surprise, no one did confront me; it seemed that most of the girls already knew me. I went into a stall to change and took my binder off so I would actually be able to breathe while I exercised. As I rushed out of the locker room \u2013no use dawdling\u2013 it occured to me that, with my visible breasts, I belonged there. I did want to be accepted inside, but I hoped to be more of a welcome guest than someone who is actually supposed to be there. The whole experience made me remember why I can\u2019t live as a girl. I felt exposed, humiliated, frustrated, and therefore hostile and upset. (Now I know why I never made new friends in gym! ;)) It was the last class in the day, luckily; I went straight home without changing or binding because I didn\u2019t dare to go into the locker room again. On the way home I kept trying to hide my chest from complete strangers who didn\u2019t give a damn about my gender. I\u2019m surprised at how much I cared about people\u2019s perception of me; I guess appearance is important for feeling confident. On the other hand, when I\u2019m presenting as male, I don\u2019t feel so upset when someone calls me \u201cshe\u201d, so maybe the key to confidence is presenting in the way that comes easiest. I\u2019m looking forward to tomorrow. I\u2019ll be presenting as male, as usual, and even though many people still think I\u2019m a girl, I know I\u2019ll doubly appreciate all the people who respect my male identity.", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 genderkid"}
