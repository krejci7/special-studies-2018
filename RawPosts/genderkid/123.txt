I had planned to elaborate on teenage sexuality, gender identity and the such; time didn\u2019t allow for it, especially considering it was one of the country\u2019s most important radio stations, but it was a nice experience. Plus, during a commercial, I discussed with one of the reporters about sexuality and gender. She had said, on the show, that sexual orientation was a \u201cchoice\u201d, and then she talked about sexual orientation when speaking about a trans person. I told her I disagreed, and later she clarified the \u201cchoice\u201d misunderstanding on the show. And, she approached me later about doing a piece on gay youth! Ok, I\u2019m not lesbian like she thinks, but she\u2019s probably interested in trans teens too. I\u2019m not sure I want that kind of exposure, but visibility and dialogue are important; I guess we can arrange for privacy. So, I\u2019ve been very LGBT-active these days! I hope these small thing I\u2019m doing will help, somehow. Extra There were some U.S. citizens at the Pride March, and look what they brought. In the background, you can see the huge Comunidad Homosexual Argentina balloon and a rainbow flag hanging over the street.", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 genderkid"}
