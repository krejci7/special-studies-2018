It\u2019s kinda huge \u2013most stores don\u2019t carry XS\u2013, but\u00a0 I love it. Yesterday, however, it caused me some trouble. I went to my grandmother\u2019s house wearing my lovely polo shirt. As usual, she started scrutinizing me. She noticed the buttons on my chest and her face darkened ominously: \u201cThat\u2019s a boy\u2019s shirt.\u201d \u201cNoo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d I lied. She showed me her own shirt: the holes were on the left and the buttons on the right. \u201cThese are girl buttons \u2013she said\u2013. You have to look for shirts like this.\u201d This is the most ridiculous gender rule I\u2019ve heard in a while, right up there with gendered colors and toys. I\u2019d forgotten all about it: when I was six, my mother explained that rich women used to be dressed by servants; buttons were placed in such a way to make the servant\u2019s job easier. Men\u2019s clothes buttoned the other way because they dressed themselves. (Supposedly, it\u2019s easier to button one way than the other, at least if you\u2019re right handed.) While we\u2019re at it, why did only men dress themselves? Was it because women were considered weak, or was it suspicious to have a man touch another \u2013naked\u2013 man? Sexism or homophobia? Two women touching wasn\u2019t suspect, of course, because everyone knew that lesbians didn\u2019t exist. And what about women who didn\u2019t have servants: were their buttons placed for their own comfort, or did their clothes button up like the rich women\u2019s? This rule should be obsolete by now. I didn\u2019t imagine that clothes makers would keep on making shirts that are harder to button up by yourself. But watch out: someone might still be policing your buttons.", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 genderkid"}
