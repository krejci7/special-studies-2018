Before questioning my gender, I had a hard time finding girl\u2019s clothes I liked, but I couldn\u2019t even conceive the notion of buying in the men\u2019s section (I had the binary well internalized). I kept looking for my own girl \u201cstyle\u201d, hoping to find something I felt comfortable wearing; altough being so picky made me feel superficial. When I started identifying as trans, I realized that I couldn\u2019t find my girl-style because I didn\u2019t feel like a girl in the first place. I became suddenly aware of all the oh-so-comfortable, oh-so-me men\u2019s clothes available \u2014 if I dared to buy it against my mother\u2019s wishes. When I finally plucked up the courage to go into a men\u2019s store, I found an obstacle I hadn\u2019t thought of: men\u2019s clothes come in men\u2019s sizes. I am only boy-sized, and thin to boot. I now know a couple of stores that sell extra-small T-shirts, and I can wear small shirts if necessary. Switching to boy shirts made me feel so much better. I could finally look at myself in mirrors without feeling my stomach twist. Pants were a tougher issue. I have female-wide hips, but men\u2019s pants are simply humongous on me. After months of wearing boy shirts, I still couldn\u2019t find boy pants in my size. I went into store after store, feeling more and more frustrated, asking the store clerks for their smallest size. They were really nice; they tried to find something my size, and you could tell they didn\u2019t want to send me to a kids\u2019 store. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to go to a children\u2019s shop: all of them have toddler-sized things in their windows. Why are there stores for teenage girls, but not for teenage boys? I mean, even boys need clothes when they aren\u2019t kids anymore, but haven\u2019t grown much either! I ended up buying a huge pair of jeans out of desperation. They didn\u2019t look too good on my thin legs, but I had to get out of my girl-fitting pants. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever find anything my size \u2014 even T can\u2019t do miracles (actually, T might make things worse, since it\u2019ll melt my hip fat away!) But, recently, a store clerk offered me a pair of extra-snug-fitting pants. And they fit! Maybe I wasn\u2019t condemned to a no-pants life, after all. I had gotten really dramatic about the whole affair: I honestly thought there were no adult pants in my size. Now, I\u2019m more optimistic: it might be harder to find clothes my size, but it isn\u2019t impossible.
