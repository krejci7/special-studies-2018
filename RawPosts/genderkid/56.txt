Tarald recently linked to this video, where Red and Charlie answer some of the most common trans-ignorant questions:  I love the answers to \u201cWhat is your real name?\u201d and \u201cAre you a man or a woman?\u201d (Charles: \u201cNo.\u201d Red: \u201cYes!\u201d Charles: \u201cWell, I have a cunt, so that makes me\u2026 a man.\u201d) There\u2019s an entire transcription up at Genderfork. I also found a \u201cphoto project on transphobic and gender-baiting questions\u201d called A Series of Questions:  \u201cA Series of Questions\u201d is a photo project exploring the power dynamics inherent in the questions asked of transgender, transsexual, genderqueer, gender-variant, and/or gender non-conforming people. Participants are photographed holding a sign upon which is written a question they have been asked. The questions are then turned on the viewer, shifting the dynamics under which they were originally asked, forming a larger series of questions which many of the people photographed face as a part of their daily lives. \u2013from the site  There\u2019s only one photograph on the site right now, but the author is going to upload some more. I\u2019m eager to see them!", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 genderkid"}
