Humor Links a series of questions answers comebacks funny ignorance questions rude trans transgender transphobia 
After being in a situation where someone asked me several rude questions, I started looking online for good and/or funny comebacks. Tarald recently linked to this video, where Red and Charlie answer some of the most common trans-ignorant questions:  I love the answers to “What is your real name?” and “Are you a man or a woman?” (Charles: “No.” Red: “Yes!” Charles: “Well, I have a cunt, so that makes me… a man.”) There’s an entire transcription up at Genderfork. I also found a “photo project on transphobic and gender-baiting questions” called A Series of Questions:  “A Series of Questions” is a photo project exploring the power dynamics inherent in the questions asked of transgender, transsexual, genderqueer, gender-variant, and/or gender non-conforming people. Participants are photographed holding a sign upon which is written a question they have been asked. The questions are then turned on the viewer, shifting the dynamics under which they were originally asked, forming a larger series of questions which many of the people photographed face as a part of their daily lives. –from the site  There’s only one photograph on the site right now, but the author is going to upload some more. I’m eager to see them!
