The last you heard of me, I was all \u201coh noez, no man will ever love me!\u201d, even though a number of people kept telling me that there are cisgender gay men who date trans guys. I had a hard time believing it, despite the fact that several gay men had hit on me in the past \u2014 men who knew about my history. I was just stuck in a pessimistic mindset. Out of curiosity, I posted a profile on a gay personals site, stating very clearly that I\u2019d transitioned from female to male, and you know what? I got dozens of positive responses within days! I was astounded. I ended up leaving the site because I couldn\u2019t get used to the anonymity (and the level of explicitness) but it was a huge confidence boost. At the same time I began to get busy with a few projects I\u2019m passionate about so I managed to pull myself out of the rut. Since then I\u2019ve been flirting with several guys, both in person and on facebook, and I\u2019ve been on a couple of dates. I\u2019m still figuring out how and when to disclose my trans status, though: the guys I met in person had known up front, but I\u2019ve been chatting with some men who don\u2019t know and I\u2019m curious to see how they\u2019ll react. I think my self-esteem can handle the rejection now. So I\u2019ve finally learned what people have been telling me all along: the gay community isn\u2019t particularly closed to trans men. It\u2019s far from being a haven of body positivity (lord help you if you\u2019re fat, old, or have dark skin) but I haven\u2019t felt as excluded as I thought. I just stick to the most feminist and activist-y spaces within the community. I hope everyone is ending their year on a positive note, too!", "feedtitle": "genderkid"}
