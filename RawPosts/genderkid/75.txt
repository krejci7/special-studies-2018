It was just an interview in which we talked about our lives as queer teenagers and our student activism, but it seems like it had a huge repercussion: people who didn\u2019t even know us emailed it to others, it was posted on several forums and some radio show hosts even talked about. I heard mostly positive opinions, except for the nasty comments on the newspaper\u2019s website, which I just stopped reading; it felt great to hear from strangers who were inspired by our \u201ccourage\u201d (I would just call it \u201cwill to live\u201d). I thought it would be cool to have our voices heard by the mainstream public. Most people never hear what life is like for a young lesbian, and they probably don\u2019t even know that transboys exist (at least not in my social context). I\u2019m all for visibility and awareness-raising\u2026 but so much exposure made me pretty nervous. Especially because some friends\u2019 parents read the news, and I\u2019m afraid that my parents might hear about it. I still haven\u2019t talked to my mom and dad about my trans identity (I want to finish school first, in case things get tense), but  I appeared in one of the country\u2019s major newspapers: I wonder how sustainable that situation is. Of course, everyone at school read it or heard about the interview. I figured that everyone knew I was trans, anyway, but apparently they still thought I was a butch girl (or a cisguy). One good thing: I\u2019m as out as can be \u2013if you don\u2019t count my family\u2013, and I haven\u2019t been harassed at all; I haven\u2019t even gotten the \u201cis that a boy or a girl\u201d comments this year. I did hear some classmates talking about me, and from the few words I could make out, they were talking about the article; but they didn\u2019t sound disrespectful, apart from the fact that I was right beside them. There isn\u2019t much bullying in my school, anyway; if anyone is transphobic, they certainly won\u2019t confront me about it. If I had known how widely that article would be read, I might not have accepted the interview; but since I can\u2019t go back, I guess I should be glad that it reached so many people. I hope it helps some queer or trans kid who might be out there.", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 genderkid"}
