Personal progress blog blogging boy FTM post School teen teenage teenager trans transboy transgender 
I’m amazed at how this blog grew from a personal reflection diary to one of those blogs that some people actually read. Thanks for stopping by, all of you! And thanks if you ever commented; I appreciate your taking a minute to share your thoughts. I try not to post too often to avoid annoying you, so I have a long line of drafts and post ideas scrawled over two notepads and a few computer folders. And school’s starting soon, so I’m going to be busier; but I’ll have lots to blog about: many people found out I was trans over the summer, so I wonder what name and pronouns they’ll use. And I’m going to start going to the men’s room full-time. I still don’t know what I’m going to do with the locker rooms, though. Some posts I’m working on: Man-breasts and boob jobs — Identities in history — Family — Pieces of gender
