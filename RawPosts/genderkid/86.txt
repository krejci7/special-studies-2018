Thanks for stopping by, all of you! And thanks if you ever commented; I appreciate your taking a minute to share your thoughts. I try not to post too often to avoid annoying you, so I have a long line of drafts and post ideas scrawled over two notepads and a few computer folders. And school\u2019s starting soon, so I\u2019m going to be busier; but I\u2019ll have lots to blog about: many people found out I was trans over the summer, so I wonder what name and pronouns they\u2019ll use. And I\u2019m going to start going to the men\u2019s room full-time. I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with the locker rooms, though. Some posts I\u2019m working on: Man-breasts and boob jobs \u2014 Identities in history \u2014 Family \u2014 Pieces of gender", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 genderkid"}
