I did loathe getting breasts and, before that, I felt nauseated from the moment I realized it would happen. They were one of the main reasons \u2013along with my overall curvy shape\u2013 I detached myself from my body at puberty. But when I started seeing myself as trans, I became aware of the reasons for my bodily dissociation, and therefore could begin the process of reconciliation. I saw countless images of people with male, boy or genderqueer  identities who not only looked like me, but were comfortable with their embodiment. I realized that my body, in fact, did not negate my identity, and that the right clothes could make me look the way I imagined myself. I found that even though my breasts \u2013according to my mental self-image\u2013 weren\u2019t supposed to be there, I could still live with them. At least temporarily. But I know that I don\u2019t want them there. And I think my body deserves to be joyfully embraced instead of merely tolerated. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I truthfully love my breasts, but in the manner of that genderfork quote: \u201cI don\u2019t hate my body, it\u2019s just not my thing.  It\u2019s like that dress you  see in the window that\u2019s gorgeous, but not your color.\u201d I wish they could somehow exist separately from my body, or that I could retain the option to put them back on occasionally (I know I wouldn\u2019t do it often, but having the choice makes all the difference. I\u2019m prone to nostalgia!). There are times when I feel rather affectionate towards my boobs. They\u2019re okay when I\u2019m alone \u2013even if I\u2019m naked\u2013 and when I see them in the mirror, I wonder if I\u2019ll miss them. They feel nice to the touch, especially in winter when they\u2019re like warm squeeze-balls. At these moments I wonder if I really need to take them off. But when I get dressed, if I don\u2019t bind, they look so out of place on my body, and make me feel so uncomfortable amongst people (even if no one notices them), that I remember why I\u2019m planning for surgery. Even when binding I feel nervous that someone will try to touch my chest; and binding has gotten so painful for me that I rarely do it anymore, even though I end up much more hostile towards everyone. Would I mind my breasts if I lived on a desert island? No, not really. But I\u2019m human, a social creature (though introverted and not-too-sociable), and my boobs have become an obstacle between myself and others. It\u2019s time to let them go.", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 genderkid"}
