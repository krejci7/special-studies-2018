Personally, I wouldn\u2019t define myself by my body, although maybe I can only say that because I \u201cpass\u201d pretty well. I think my transition started around the time I assumed a male-ish identity. I could say my transition only consisted in that moment, but I accept that slowly changing my life is a big part of the process. Lots of people consider that transition doesn\u2019t end for them, and that sounds right for me too. But \u201ctransition\u201d means a transit from one state to another: does it make sense to use that term if you don\u2019t define an ending point? Lately I\u2019ve started to question the very word. I\u2019m not criticizing its use by other trans people \u2013plus I might keep using it myself\u2013 but I\u2019ve been thinking about it. We have the chance to remake ourselves every day. I\u2019m aware that reinventing an identity isn\u2019t simple: I couldn\u2019t start wearing \u201cboy\u201d clothes without a struggle with my family, and my friends couldn\u2019t switch pronouns immediately. But at the same time, I started introducing myself with my new name whenever I met someone; I never had to transition with these people. Where would all of this leave me along the transition line? I don\u2019t think this process can be mapped along a line; there are too many different aspects to it. If you can\u2019t draw a line \u2013if it\u2019s a huge amorphous neverending beast of a process\u2013 can you still call it a transition, or is it just life? I guess there will be a point in my life when gender isn\u2019t an issue anymore, at least in my daily life. Gender will probably never be a non-issue personally and legally, but when everyone in my life uses my chosen name and pronouns, I suppose I\u2019ll look back on this gender-messy time and call it \u201ctransition\u201d. It\u2019s just hard to imagine that future.", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 genderkid"}
