For every boy who is burdened with the constant expectation of knowing everything, there is a girl tired of people not trusting her intelligence. For every girl who is tired of being called over-sensitive, there is a boy who fears to be gentle, to weep. For every boy for whom competition is the only way to prove his masculinity, there is a girl who is called unfeminine when she competes. For every girl who throws out her E-Z Bake Oven, there is a boy who wishes to find one. For every boy struggling not to let advertising dictate his desires, there is a girl facing the ad industry\u2019s attacks on her self-esteem. For every girl who takes a step toward her liberation, there is a boy who finds the way to freedom a little easier. This text\u00a0 is just awesome. I think everyone should see it; I\u2019d like to paint it onto a poster and put it up at school. Why do we have to gender every human emotion? Why can\u2019t people see that we are all more or less gender-variant? No one fits the stereotypes; or stereotypes don\u2019t fit anyone. So who should we fix, the person or the box? Sounds like a no-brainer to me. I saw this for the first time on a handout, at my first Pride March; this post at Labels Are For Jars made me remember. By the way, Labels Are For Jars is a blog by an incredible mother who doesn\u2019t force societal gender norms onto her (also incredible) boy; check it out! Poem attributed to Nancy R. Smith. This site claims to contain the original 1973 version, called For Every Woman (different, but with the same general idea).", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 genderkid"}
