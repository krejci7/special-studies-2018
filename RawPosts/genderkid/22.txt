I know it, too, to the point that I get annoyed when trans is defined as \u201csomeone whose gender differs from their sex\u201d (as if only two sex/gender combinations were valid and the rest were incongruent!) But in this post I want to explore the places where gender and body do overlap in ways that don\u2019t fit neatly into the binary of sex vs gender. My personal experience of dysphoria, for the most part, hasn\u2019t been gendered (other people\u2019s experience differs). My hips and breasts bother me, not because I see a woman when I look at them, but because they don\u2019t feel right on my body. The only feature which felt wrong in a gendered way, pre-testosterone, was my face: from certain angles, I could see myself as a girl, even though I could look at my entire naked body and see a boy. My goal in physically transitioning wasn\u2019t to align my sex and gender, but rather to allow my body to reflect how I see myself in my mind. Before that, I transitioned socially to align my self-perception with the way people referred to me. I saw them as separate \u2013though interacting\u2013 processes. Certainly, gender \u2013as in identity\u2013 is independent from the body: no one can tell you how to identify based on your sex (or based on anything else, for that matter), although your identity can affect how you relate to your body. But masculinity and femininity often are expressed through the body, e.g. in the form of muscles and body hair: whether or not they\u2019re developed, whether or not it\u2019s removed. I know that muscles don\u2019t make the man (or the butch); the point is that people do use their bodies to signal parts of their identity, including aspects of their gender.* I\u2019m thinking about all this because I\u2019ve long passed the point where I went from looking like a pre-pubescent boy  to looking like an adolescent boy, and now I\u2019m hovering on the edge of being  perceived as a Man. And, given the shape of my jaw and my  soon-to-be-copious facial hair, I won\u2019t look like a delicate man,  either, but a Manly Man. And that intrigues me and worries me at the same time, since I don\u2019t feel masculine. I am comfortable presenting as male, and being read as one, even though I don\u2019t identify as a man/male; will I be ok with being seen as manly? (Granted, the rest of my body \u2013thin and un-muscular\u2013 does offset the effect.) And will I still recognize myself if my face expresses a gender which is slightly off, or will I flinch like I did when I could see a girl in my face? It might not be a trans thing, though. I love this post by femme guy (who is cis) about feeling that his body isn\u2019t acceptable as femme: I spent a lot of time feeling that the way I look was out of step with my gender identity\u2026 I felt like the canonical femme man is a tiny slip of a boy, and trying  to be a gentle, faggy, flamey boy at my size was just ludicrous and  there was no way I could fully live my gender presentation in the size  and shape I\u2019m in. If my wariness about having a \u201cmanly\u201d body is similar to his, then I\u2019ll have to work through my own prejudice about masculinity, femininity and how it\u2019s displayed on bodies (heck, anyone would do well to rethink these things). But I\u2019ll pay attention to how I feel about my facial changes in case it is a trans thing, and I stop recognizing myself (dysphoria is not about living up to stereotypes, and it can\u2019t be dispelled by thought or analysis). If that happens, I\u2019ll consider stopping T. But I\u2019m ok for now. *Wheelchair Dancer points out how disability theory deepens our understanding of gender/sexuality identities as related to the body.", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 genderkid"}
