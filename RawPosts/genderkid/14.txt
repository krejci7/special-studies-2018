I never thought I\u2019d dare to do something like this \u2014 that is, until I transitioned. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to wander around the country in the past few years, both with family and with friends & classmates, so I\u2019ve been able to see how my attitude towards travel has shifted throughout my transition. I loved vacationing as a kid, but it started to be awkward when my appearance became ambiguous in my mid-teens (partly because of the public restroom dilemma, partly because my parents were embarrassed when people read me as male). Then there was a long period when travel was utterly terrifying for me, first because I was obviously queer, then because I was passing as male full-time but I knew I could be \u201cdiscovered\u201d at any time due to my voice and chest. Heck, my own city became scary for a while (though that\u2019s another story), so why would I want to go to places that were unfamiliar and full of people? But as I\u2019ve mentioned before, transitioning has opened a lot of doors for me. So, when I had the chance to travel to a student conference a few months ago, I allowed myself to be talked into going. I had good reasons for not going: we\u2019d all be sleeping together on a gym floor, I didn\u2019t know what the shower setup would be in the locker rooms, and none of my classmates knew about my past. But deep down I knew that I\u2019d be fine and that I was just making excuses for not stepping out of my comfort zone, so I let myself be dragged along with my friends. (Important note: I was with people I trusted and who would\u2019ve been OK with my trans status if I\u2019d had to disclose for whatever reason. I didn\u2019t put myself in risk at any time.) And you know what? I had a great time. With my newfound confidence, meeting new people from around the country was less daunting than it would have been an year earlier. And the thing I\u2019d been most anxious about \u2013my trans body and how I\u2019d maneuver it through certain situations\u2013 wasn\u2019t such a big deal after all. In fact, my worst fear about the showers did come true \u2013there were no partitions whatsoever\u2013 but I simply bathed in swimming trunks and wrapped a towel around my waist when changing.\u00a0 And when it was time get un/dressed in the evenings and mornings, I felt comfortable enough to take my shirt and pants off in front of hundreds of people \u2013modestly facing the wall\u2013 even though someone could\u2019ve noticed my chest scars or the lack of bulge in my underpants (which aren\u2019t obvious signals of transness, anyway). All in all, being trans was a non-issue in that trip. So I pretty much jumped off the deep end when it comes to traveling stealth \u2013it might have been less intimidating if I\u2019d been with a smaller group and staying in a hotel\u2013 but I managed to get through it with ease. Knowing that I\u2019m capable of confronting this kind of situation has given me a huge confidence boost: I feel that my horizons have expanded significantly, in quite a literal sense. I can\u2019t even imagine the freedom I\u2019ll feel when I can get my ID in order.", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 genderkid"}
