She did a pretty good job. For instance, she didn\u2019t state that \u201csome people\u2019s genders don\u2019t match their sex\u201d, which is a common thing to say but favors one sex/gender combination over another. Instead, she said that we usually associate a certain sex with a certain gender, although other combinations are certainly possible. Alas, she kept speaking in binaries, and defined gender in a peculiar way: as masculinity and femininity. I do agree that those are important parts of gender, but I tried to point out that there\u2019s another significant component \u2014 being a man or a woman (or something else). I think these are very different concepts. Sure, they tend to be bound together \u2013which is why I sometimes feel conflicted over wearing pink pajamas\u2013 but they aren\u2019t inextricable: I have learned to embrace my traditionally feminine traits without feeling any less of a guy. The example I gave in class: a person can be \u201cborn\u201d \u201cmale\u201d, identify as a woman, and be masculine. Unfortunately, the teacher didn\u2019t understand my point, but at the end of the class she approached me and said \u201cI\u2019m not an expert on these subject; you could bring some material to the class, if you want\u201d. I think I accepted; I was very nervous at that point, having talked about something so close to home, and in the environment which makes me most insecure about my gender. I usually love discussing issues of sex/gender/sexuality, but maybe it isn\u2019t worth doing that among these particular classmates. On the other hand, it might be an opportunity to make my them understand my identity. They do sort of know I\u2019m trans, although I haven\u2019t come out directly to most of them; I guess, to them, I\u2019m a butch lesbian who wants to be a man. It would be a great relief if they started using my chosen name. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do \u2014 I don\u2019t even know what the teacher meant by \u201cbringing something to the class\u201d\u2013 but, just in case, I\u2019m looking through Audacia Ray\u2019s Human Sexuality Syllabus 2.0 for articles explaining gender/trans 101. Scarleteen\u2019s Genderpalooza article is a good resource, too. When the teacher approached me, I mumbled something about Judith Butler, although I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s written anything short and accessible; I also thought about the theorist Beatriz Preciado, but the same goes for her. Do you have any recommendations? Trans 101 articles, or websites that help you to explain the complexities of gender?", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 genderkid"}
