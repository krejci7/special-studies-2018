If you\u2019re in the northern hemisphere, remember that it\u2019s winter in the south, which means we shouldn\u2019t be on vacation right now. Plus, it\u2019s cold, so more people get sick. A lot of people are dying from swine flu around here, which is worrying since it shouldn\u2019t be so serious. This happened pretty suddenly, so I didn\u2019t have the presence of mind to get something extracurricular out of the school library. I\u2019ve been meaning to read Foucault\u2019s History of Sexuality, although I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d understand it; now would be a good time to try. The library might just be open until today, so do you have any recommendations? Keep in mind that my school\u2019s library mostly has classics.", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 genderkid"}
