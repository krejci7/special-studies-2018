Uncategorized foucault history of sexuality holidays library swine flu 
All schools in Argentina have just closed until August 3 due to the swine flu, which means one month of unexpected holidays. If you’re in the northern hemisphere, remember that it’s winter in the south, which means we shouldn’t be on vacation right now. Plus, it’s cold, so more people get sick. A lot of people are dying from swine flu around here, which is worrying since it shouldn’t be so serious. This happened pretty suddenly, so I didn’t have the presence of mind to get something extracurricular out of the school library. I’ve been meaning to read Foucault’s History of Sexuality, although I’m not sure I’d understand it; now would be a good time to try. The library might just be open until today, so do you have any recommendations? Keep in mind that my school’s library mostly has classics.
