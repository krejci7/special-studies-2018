Humor gender bending Theorizing yellow submarine 
I recently caught myself singing “Yellow Submarine” under my breath — accidentally saying “gender” instead of “yellow”. I need to take a breather from gender-theorizing and identity-seeking (as if that were possible). But, yeah, transgender and genderqueer are still pretty much invisible to the larger world; we do live in a submarine of sorts. So we sailed up to the sun Till we found a sea of green And we lived beneath the waves in our gender submarine ———————————————- Gender is yellow The “yellow” reminds me of my header image (made from an image by rick). I like the way the “man” and “woman” aren’t straight, but they aren’t crooked or twisted either: they’re wavy. Maybe, just maybe, they’re bending gender.
