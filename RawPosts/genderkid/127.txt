I need to take a breather from gender-theorizing and identity-seeking (as if that were possible). But, yeah, transgender and genderqueer are still pretty much invisible to the larger world; we do live in a submarine of sorts. So we sailed up to the sun Till we found a sea of green And we lived beneath the waves in our gender submarine \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Gender is yellow The \u201cyellow\u201d reminds me of my header image (made from an image by rick). I like the way the \u201cman\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d aren\u2019t straight, but they aren\u2019t crooked or twisted either: they\u2019re wavy.
