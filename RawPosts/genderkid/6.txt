He\u2019s absolutely amazing and I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s interested in me. He\u2019s beautiful and kind; a brilliant scholar and a human rights activist. This should be a good thing, but he\u2019s so great that, often, I can\u2019t fathom why he\u2019d want to spend time with me. My self-esteem is usually okay, but it keeps faltering when I think about him, and I think part of it is internalized transphobia. My self-doubts aren\u2019t only about being trans, of course. I can\u2019t help comparing myself to him and I obviously don\u2019t measure up: he has already changed the world through his work \u2013this is not an exaggeration\u2013 while my biggest accomplishments are getting good grades and staying alive. Oh, and impromptu singing/dancing performances in public spaces. But a large part of my insecurity does stem from being trans. Surprisingly, it isn\u2019t only about my body: somehow, I\u2019ve discovered entirely new things to be insecure about! (My body is part of it, though. It doesn\u2019t make sense because I like my body, and so does H, but I can\u2019t help feeling that I\u2019m letting him down.) I\u2019ve always been proud about my past and felt glad that it led me towards feminism, the trans community and friendships with lesbians. I still am, but it\u2019s glaringly obvious that my place in the world is very different from cis gays like H. We belong to the same community, but we experience it in diverging ways. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be accepted as \u201cone of the fags\u201d \u2013people might always see me as just trans\u2013 and my solidarity is strongest towards dykes and trans folks. And even beyond the community, in our everyday lives, being trans makes me different: I inevitably have endo or gyno appointments, endless name-change paperwork, trans guy meetings\u2026 And that\u2019s okay, but sometimes it feels like I fall short, you know? I can\u2019t help thinking: here\u2019s this guy who could choose from a large selection of men, so why would he settle for an anonymous trans dude? If he could pick someone similar to him, why did he go for someone different? I know this reasoning is deeply transphobic and difference-phobic; I know we the trans people are not lesser than anyone, and that any relationship involves overcoming differences. So I\u2019m working hard to remind myself. And I\u2019m trying to relax and enjoy being with H, because \u2013whatever my worries\u2013 he does seem to like me.", "feedtitle": "genderkid"}
