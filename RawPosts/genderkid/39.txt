A while ago I tried to do it: I typed in my ID number, found my legal name, and proceeded to answer several statistical questions: Which secondary school did I attend? Do I have a car? Does my home have a computer? Am I male or female? At first I answered \u201cmale\u201d; went back and marked \u201cfemale\u201d; decided it was just for statistical reasons and clicked \u201cmale\u201d. But when my registration was almost complete, I was asked to confirm my personal data: I was going to need it to pick up my student ID. I found out that my sex wasn\u2019t just a statistical fact: it was one of the three or four pieces of information that the college considers important. What would happen if I marked \u201cmale\u201d? My whole application might be considered invalid, although my full legal name and ID number should be enough to prove my (legal) identity. This university has a quarter million students; if I mess up, fixing my mistake would be a bureaucratic nightmare. So, why not pick \u201cfemale\u201d? After all, my legal name is already there; it\u2019s not like choosing \u201cmale\u201d would fix the identity mismatch. If the system had classified me as female from the beginning, I wouldn\u2019t have minded so much; I wouldn\u2019t have to mis-identify myself. But having the choice right in front of me \u2013and nobody physically present to ask \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re male, Rosa?\u201d (not my real name)\u2013 is sooo tempting. It\u2019s hard, not being able to choose what feels right; having to define myself in a way that\u2019s grossly incorrect. I\u2019m going to think this over, but I know I\u2019ll probably mark \u201cfemale\u201d; I don\u2019t want to risk missing a semester because my info wasn\u2019t processed correctly. In any case, I have to argue with the registration people to let me include my preferred name somewhere, so I can fight this battle when I do that. At least my student ID picture will look like me.", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 genderkid"}
