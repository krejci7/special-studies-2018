The interesting thing about all this is that the Olympic committee makes exceptions for women who are transgender. So, openly trans women are allowed to compete unmolested by embarrassing tests as long as they have had full surgeries, two years worth of hormone replacement therapy, etc. That means that the women most negatively affected by this testing are women who are still transitioning, or women who may have lived their whole lives as women, but who test male when their chromosomes are analyzed (they might be XXY). Feminocracy What is a real woman, then? I\u2019ve been trying to answer this question for a long time. Does feeling like a woman make you a woman? I\u2019d say yes. But what if you say you feel like a woman, but your gender presentation is totally male? Butch women come to mind, and they\u2019re definitely women; but what about those guys who say they\u2019re lesbians trapped in men\u2019s bodies? I mean the jerks, not the transwomen who really are lesbians trapped in male bodies. I guess it\u2019s jerks like these that the Olympians are trying to stop. But what cisgendered guy would seriously pretend to be a transwoman, for the whole world to see? It\u2019s hard enough for real transpeople; I don\u2019t think a cisperson could take it. So maybe they should just trust people\u2019s gender statement. Genitals, hormones and chromosomes don\u2019t even matter: not all transpeople go through sex reassignment surgery, and many skip hormones altogether. And what about genderqueer people? Should they be able to choose what category to participate in? I can\u2019t even pick what bathroom to go to, for heck\u2019s sake! Although it\u2019s probably your legal sex that matters.", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 genderkid"}
