A couple of noteworthy links: I’ve been sending stuff I found to Sociological Images –articles, images, videos–, and they published some of it, adding their analysis: Women as Tools of Economic Development, On Being Genderqueer, Gender-Ambiguous People as Incomplete, the new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and One Laptop Per Child. “No Dumb Questions” is a place for trans people & friends to tell their own story: “By sharing our stories we can change hearts and minds from fear and bias to understanding and love.” The idea sounded nice to me, at first, but then I started thinking: are these stories supposed to represent the “trans experience”? I don’t think there even is one “trans experience.” I started thinking about these issues after seeing the trailer for Against a Trans Narrative (via Malcolm), which expresses concerns about the visibility of “the trans experience;” for instance, you’re supposed to tell a certain story to acheive access to hormones. I think no one should claim to speak for the whole community, but if each of us speaks for ourselves, we’ll end up showing a great diversity of trans experiences. Maybe the solution to misrepresentation, then, would be for all of us to tell our stories. What do you think?
