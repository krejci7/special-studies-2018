I don\u2019t think there even is one \u201ctrans experience.\u201d I started thinking about these issues after seeing the trailer for Against a Trans Narrative (via Malcolm), which expresses concerns about the visibility of \u201cthe trans experience;\u201d for instance, you\u2019re supposed to tell a certain story to acheive access to hormones. I think no one should claim to speak for the whole community, but if each of us speaks for ourselves, we\u2019ll end up showing a great diversity of trans experiences. Maybe the solution to misrepresentation, then, would be for all of us to tell our stories. What do you think?", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 genderkid"}
