Eventually, I realized that people actually did read what I wrote (at least that\u2019s what the stats said), and that felt really nice. When I started getting comments, that was even better: I learned about your thoughts and experiences, and found out that many of you were going through the same things as I was. That\u2019s invaluable: if I had decided to write in a private journal, I wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to hear your voices. Thanks for taking an interest in what I write and for sharing your comments; above all, thanks for reading. Blog Reader Appreciation Day 2009", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 genderkid"}
