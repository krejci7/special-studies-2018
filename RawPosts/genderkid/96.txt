When I turned 15, I started identifying as a lesbian; most people still believed I was straight unless I was out to them. A year later I started dressing more boyishly, and I was pretty visibly gay. People who know as a girl still assume I\u2019m a lesbian. Now, most people take me for a cisgender boy when we meet. If we meet in an LGBTQ context, they think I\u2019m a gay male; in straight spaces, I don\u2019t know what sexuality I look like. But whenever people learn I\u2019m trans, they immediately assume I\u2019m heterosexual. I think it\u2019s funny to be percieved as all sorts of things by different people. It can be exasperating at times: if queer men think I\u2019m straight, I won\u2019t have a chance with them. And it\u2019s weird to discover how heterosexist LGBT people can be. But I guess it\u2019s understandable: after all, I did identify proudly as a lesbian in the past.", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 genderkid"}
