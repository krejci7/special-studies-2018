I\u2019ve mentioned sometimes going to an lgbt youth group. Last week, one of the coordinators took me aside to ask me about my transition process. She said that, as a minor, I can\u2019t do much without parental consent; but I can do the requisite three months of therapy to get diagnosed as gender dysphoric. After that, I can start hormone therapy. I spoke to one of the center\u2019s psychiatrists and his advice was to do the diagnosis through my own psychologist, since she already knows me. My psychologist sort of agreed, although she wants to clear things up with my parents first. Who knows how long that will take. But at least I\u2019m inching forward. So, where\u2019s the politics? The issue is that I\u2019m not particularly happy about being diagnosed with a mental illness. I believe that trans people, or genderqueer people, or anyone dissatisfied with their body, should be able to alter it without having to prove themselves to a doctor or a judge (in Argentina, for surgery and ID changes, you have to show a judge that you\u2019re \u201ctrans enough\u201d). I especially disagree with one of the criteria for dysphoria, which is that you have to suffer in order to deserve treatment.  It would be \u2013sort of\u2013 easy to stick to the system despite my opinions. I wouldn\u2019t even have to lie for the diagnosis: my psychologist knows my whole twisted doubt-ridden history, and she considers me trans anyway. But I know of some activists who avoided the system, waiting 10 (ten!) years for ID changes, working the streets to pay their surgery and hormones. That\u2019s being loyal to one\u2019s ideals. With these people in mind, I feel pretty hypocritical. But I really want to change my body. As soon as possible. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 PS: For more about the political implications of lying to the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d, see Elliot Long\u2018s essay from the Beyond Masculinity anthology (especially here, from the third paragraph). \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 PPS: Through Going Somewhere I found this funny and insightful essay. The author, receiving hir parents for the first time after chest surgery, makes hirself a pair of \u201cpudding tits\u201d so they won\u2019t notice; this makes hir think about bodies, identities and how we are read by others. What I hope for is a way in which we can actively articulate, rewrite, translate, and metaphorize, both in terms of verbal and bodily language, in order to continue the long project of fighting ourselves into existence.", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 genderkid"}
