I still have no idea where this is going to lead, but I like him and he makes me feel really good. Part of it, of course, is that he makes me feel desirable, attractive and respected, but partly it\u2019s because he makes me feel like a gay man. This is confusing for me because it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve needed any sort of affirmation of my gender. Actually, I\u2019ve always gotten uncomfortable when someone goes out of their way to prove they see me as a man; I\u2019ve never even identified completely with the idea of manhood. And I used to scoff at phrases like \u201che/she makes me feel like a man/woman\u201d \u2013when pronounced by anyone, trans or not\u2013 because I thought a person\u2019s gender shouldn\u2019t depend on anyone but themself. I felt this kind of validation for the first time when I went to a rather seedy gay establishment with several queer trans guys. Lots of men checked us out and even approached some of us, and it felt amazing because (in the words of a friend) \u201cwe stopped being seen as trans and began to be seen as hunks\u201d. I didn\u2019t engage with anyone there, but I left feeling super empowered, like I finally belonged. Later on, I made out with a friend and I was completely floored by the way our beards and leg hair rubbed together, and by the way he ran his fingernails across my body, which was so different from the light touch I had experienced with girls. Spending time with H has been especially incredible because he\u2019s always known I was trans, but it hasn\u2019t been an issue. We\u2019ve both talked about our pasts, including my transition, and he has seen me naked, but he\u2019s never made me feel different. Partly it\u2019s because he\u2019s amazing, but I think my attitude helps, too: I\u2019ve managed to embrace my body and history so my comfort kind of rubs off on others. I finally feel like a gay man not only in theory, but in practice. I don\u2019t really care about being A Man or not, but being a Gay Man \u2013and being with gay men\u2013 feels just right. I love the way H caresses my beard and body hair, the way he holds onto my hand or shoulder on the street despite the occasional insult hurled against us, and the weight of his large hand on my back as we drift into sleep. I am thrilled by the idea of being someone\u2019s gay lover, although I don\u2019t want to get my hopes up because he\u2019s too perfect to be true. But I\u2019m also scared by how good he makes me feel because it could end at any moment. I\u00a0 guess love is always like that, though, and I just have the extra fear of feeling excluded from the gay world once again (which is silly because there will always be more men who are into me, like I wrote last week). I suppose cis gays feel this too, especially if they don\u2019t resemble the \u201cideal\u201d gay man, although they mostly don\u2019t have a history of gender denial to throw into the mix. I know I\u2019m not alone in my feelings because they\u2019re echoed in an article called \u201cThere\u2019s No Pamphlet for the Kind of Sex I Have: HIV-Related Risk Factors and Protective Behaviors Among Transgender Men Who Have Sex with Non-Transgender Men\u201d: \u201cAll of the participants reflected on the sense of validation that having sex with a non-trans man could provide. Many suggested that this was particularly powerful for trans men in their early years of transition and that being sexual with a gay non-trans man could feel like the \u201cultimate affirmation\u201d of one\u2019s manhood. This led many participants to ponder the risks that they, and other trans men, were willing to take to receive this sense of affirmation.\u201d The risk-taking doesn\u2019t resonate with me because I\u2019m not willing to have unsafe sex (or even have safe sex with people I\u2019m not attracted to), but many of the participants\u2019 quotes are spot-on. It\u2019s a very good read and it\u2019s gotten me interested in sexual health among queer trans men (possibly something to work on this year?). I wish us all a great 2013, with love, strength and energy to tackle our dreams.", "feedtitle": "genderkid"}
