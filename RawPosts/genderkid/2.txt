I feel like I\u2019ve lived a whole lifetime since starting T \u2014 not necessarily because of transition-related reasons, but because I\u2019m 21 years old and still growing at a really intense pace. But I\u2019d like to summarize \u2013real quick\u2013 what\u2019s been going on with my body. My first year on T was the Year of Most Changes: my voice dropped, most of my body fat redistributed, my face got more angular, and so on. The second year was the Year of the Beard; at that point I had stopped paying attention to physical changes until I suddenly realized that I could grow a decent beard (and I never shaved again). And this third year, apparently, is the Year of MOAR HAIR. I already had hair everywhere \u2013even pre-T\u2013 but now it seems to be thickening in odd places (like my wrists) and spreading even further across my stomach. And, to my great joy, my beard seems to continue to fill in, although I did accept it in its previous sparse, patchy glory. All of this is actually too slow to observe; I only noticed because I gradually had to increase the frequency of my beard-trimming to once a week instead of once a month. It\u2019s true what they say, then \u2014 testosterone continues to change your body even a few years after starting. I\u2019m not sure, though, if my changes are still specifically transition-related or if it\u2019s all part of growing older in a testosterone-fueled body (cisgender men continue to get hairier way beyond puberty). Whichever it is, I\u2019m really enjoying growing into my body and love it more every day =)", "feedtitle": "genderkid"}
