Rants family gender transgender 
Yesterday, my dad organized our family’s first Boys’ Night Out. I wasn’t invited. I had managed to swallow my frustration and get over it, but today several people told me how much fun it was. Plus, I missed seeing some of my cousins who live far away. I’ve been pretty happy and busy these past weeks –which is why I haven’t been posting– but this really annoys me: my dad knows I’m trans, and he knows how much I enjoy spending time with my male cousins and uncles. Does anyone else have a story about being left out (or included!) in family events because of (or regardless of) gender?
