I wasn\u2019t invited. I had managed to swallow my frustration and get over it, but today several people told me how much fun it was. Plus, I missed seeing some of my cousins who live far away. I\u2019ve been pretty happy and busy these past weeks \u2013which is why I haven\u2019t been posting\u2013 but this really annoys me: my dad knows I\u2019m trans, and he knows how much I enjoy spending time with my male cousins and uncles. Does anyone else have a story about being left out (or included!) in family events because of (or regardless of) gender?", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 genderkid"}
