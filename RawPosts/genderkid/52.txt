The photographer just published a bunch of images online (hat tip to en|gender):  The subjects, self-identified people of transgender and transsexual experience, hold signs depicting questions that each has had posed to them personally\u2013 some by strangers, others by loved ones, friends, or colleagues. Presented on white wooden boards, the questions are turned on the viewer, shifting the dynamics under which they were originally asked, and prompting the viewer to cast a reflective, self-critical eye upon him or herself, revealing how invasive this frame of reference can be.  Several of the questions really resonated with me. \u201cWho will want to date you?\u201d \u201cAre you sure this is right for you?\u201d And the pictures are absolutely beautiful. Enjoy.", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 genderkid"}
