One of my teachers is extraordinarily gay-friendly. She\u2019s married to a man, but she keeps bringing up gay issues and addressing homophobia. This week we had to turn in a group paper for her class; everyone in my group had written their full name, but I had just signed my last name, so at the end of the period she called me aside. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you include your first name?\u201d I panicked: \u201cI don\u2019t know. No reason.\u201d She left it at that, but I saw her in the hallway later on and I apologized for being so blunt and defensive. I told her that I do not like my first name at all and I don\u2019t use it. I didn\u2019t think it was necessary or wise to explain any further; not all gay-friendly people are trans-friendly. She probably figured me out, though. In any case, she won\u2019t call me by my first name; that\u2019s a relief. It might seem an insignificant detail, but hearing my legal name over and over again gets stressful; if it weren\u2019t, I might not have decided to transition socially. I also started an extracurricular class this week. I almost didn\u2019t sign up because I didn\u2019t know what name to use \u2013what if I had to show my ID?\u2013 and because I already knew the instructor from another course I attended as a female. I ended up sending him an email explaining, very briefly, that I had changed my name. I decided that if he didn\u2019t accept my new name, I wouldn\u2019t attend these classes; I wouldn\u2019t voluntarily go somewhere where I have to endure female treatment (except for school, which is worth it). I remembered this teacher as a nice guy, but some apparently open people don\u2019t understand trans issues at all. It turns out that I worried uselessly: he sent me an even briefer email saying \u201cOk, see you!\u201d and from the minute he stepped into the class he called me \u201che\u201d and my new name. Moments like these make me hopeful about the future.", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 genderkid"}
