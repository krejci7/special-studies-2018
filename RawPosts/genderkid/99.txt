He\u2019s a racer called Marcos Di Palma, \u201cel Loco\u201d (the crazy man); here\u2019s another picture of him wearing this fake belly. Why did he do this? Translated, he said that \u201cThese pictures are, in some way, a homage to my fans, because being a fan of mine is like going into labor. And with all the taunting, they suffer more than if they were pregnant.\u201d Is it just me, or is that totally senseless? If these pictures are intended to raise a controversy for publicity, it\u2019s working: several newspapers featured the story. If pregnant men and transmen were considered \u201cnormal\u201d, this wouldn\u2019t grab our attention; but apparently, they/we are still a curiosity.", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 genderkid"}
