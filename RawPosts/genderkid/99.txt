Activism, Politics and Mass Media cisgender man Corsa marcos di palma parody pregnant man trans in media transgender 
An Argentinean racing magazine, Corsa, just published an issue with a “pregnant man” on the cover. He’s a racer called Marcos Di Palma, “el Loco” (the crazy man); here’s another picture of him wearing this fake belly. Why did he do this? Translated, he said that “These pictures are, in some way, a homage to my fans, because being a fan of mine is like going into labor. And with all the taunting, they suffer more than if they were pregnant.” Is it just me, or is that totally senseless? If these pictures are intended to raise a controversy for publicity, it’s working: several newspapers featured the story. If pregnant men and transmen were considered “normal”, this wouldn’t grab our attention; but apparently, they/we are still a curiosity.
