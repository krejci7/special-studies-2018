I intended to use this blog to mull over my gender thoughts, but in any given day I\u2019ve gone through identifying as genderqueer to ftm to butch dyke. Whenever I tried to write something down -here or in a gender notebook I keep- I ended up identifying as something else entirely! Anyway, I\u2019ve been feeling more male every day. I\u2019ve always avoided looking at myself -in mirrors, for instance- but I\u2019ve been checking out my own body, inspired by an essay by an FTM person. I don\u2019t hate my physique, but I\u2019d love to stand up straight without worrying about my chest, I\u2019d like to have biceps, I\u2019d like to have less of a waist. I\u2019m starting to think that I\u2019m much more trans than I believed I was. It\u2019s scary, but it\u2019s exciting too.", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 genderkid"}
