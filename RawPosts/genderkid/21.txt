I asked his secretary to book a date, but she forgot to call us back; so I didn\u2019t have any updates until last week, when I had another appointment with him. As it turns out, I was booked for this week \u2014 more precisely, tomorrow! The surgeon gave us a few days to think about it, given that we\u2019d just found out (\u201cus\u201d is my parents and I \u2014 they\u2019re amazingly involved). The timing is almost perfect as I haven\u2019t started school yet, so we\u2019ve decided to go for it. I couldn\u2019t believe it was really happening until yesterday, when I showed the doctor my last lab results, and I had a million pre-op tasks to do that kept me from posting here. I always thought that I\u2019d burst of nervousness the days before surgery, but I\u2019ve felt oddly calm since setting the date a week ago. I\u2019m not overly worried about the surgery itself: there are risks, but I\u2019m in great health; and I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s worth it. I\u2019m not too concerned about the aesthetic results, either: I\u2019ve thought about that thoroughly before choosing a surgeon, so I have the peace of mind of knowing I made the right choice. Actually, my main concerns right now are (1) how my parents will feel during surgery \u2014 the waiting time must be awful; (2) how I\u2019ll feel in the clinic before surgery \u2014 the preparations are probably unnerving; and (3) being weak for several weeks post-op, since my commute to school will be physically demanding. Mostly, I\u2019m just glad I\u2019m getting this done. I should go now, to eat & drink for the last time before surgery, and to say goodbye to my breasts. Readers and future chest: I\u2019ll see you all tomorrow! PS: Here\u2019s a relevant quote by Jamison Green that I found: Understanding the surgery one is seeking requires  accepting the fact that one is altering his body and that he will never  have the body with which he should have been born. This means accepting  the limitations that his body has before he gets on the operating table,  and accepting that he will not come out of this scarless, without  wounds, or without compromises. That is not to say that transmen can\u2019t  keep working and hoping for improvements \u2013 we can and we do. But we have  to live in our bodies one way or another. We need to know how much  imperfection we can handle. Identifying as a transsexual means we have  signed up to consider these questions. not to do so is to invite  disaster.", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 genderkid"}
