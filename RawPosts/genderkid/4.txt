It\u2019s about a trans man who hooks up with a cis (non-trans) man and is pressured into having unprotected sex: the cis dude hints that he wouldn\u2019t be able to \u201ckeep it up\u201d with a condom because he\u2019s not used to trans bodies. Actually, the PSA title translates to \u201cI won\u2019t wear one for you\u201d. (It\u2019s in French, but you can choose English or French captioning.) Thankfully, I\u2019ve never been in this situation, but I really empathize with the main character\u2019s decisions. The cis guy makes him feel inadequate because of his body \u2013making it seem like he\u2019s doing him a favor by sleeping with him\u2013 and the trans guy allows him to drop the condom as a way of \u201cmaking it up\u201d to him. It\u2019s super tragic, really: the cis man makes the trans man feel lesser-than, undesirable and unworthy of respect. But it doesn\u2019t seem uncommon; there\u2019s actually a medical study about this same subject called \u201cThere\u2019s No Pamphlet for the Kind of Sex I Have: HIV-Related Risk Factors and Protective Behaviors Among Transgender Men Who Have Sex with Non-Transgender Men\u201d. I\u2019ve been watching this video over and over because it\u2019s so rare to see my own issues represented in any kind of media. Like I\u2019ve said, I\u2019ve never been in this scenario, but I do constantly navigate cis/trans power dynamics and I really feel the need for more stories about gay or queer trans men which reflect these kind of problems. I\u2019m fascinated by how strongly I relate to the main character in this PSA; also, I love how his body is celebrated in the surreal dream/dance scene. If anyone knows about any media (videos, short stories, poems) about gay trans men, please share in the comments! I recommend the German movie Romeos, which is a love story between two men, one trans and one cis.", "feedtitle": "genderkid"}
