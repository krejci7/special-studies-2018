Though my name hasn\u2019t been changed in the school\u2019s system (and I haven\u2019t changed it legally, either), I talked to all my teachers at the beginning of the year and managed to maneuver through tight situations without having to disclose my past. This is the first time that I\u2019ve been \u201cstealth\u201d \u2013not openly trans\u2013 in my everyday life (though I have been stealth in one class or another for 2.5 years). It made me realize that, like teenage boys, I hadn\u2019t yet formed an identity to go with the young (cis) man people were starting to see me as. In fact, I think I went through all the steps of teen male socialization in fast forward: I tried to be masculine at first and avoided physical contact with guys, fearing rejection; then I tested the waters to see if my new friends were ok with breaking gender rules; and finally I felt comfortable enough to let my guard down. It\u2019s been curious, seeing how the same parts of myself have different implications depending on whether I\u2019m seen as trans or cis. If I talk about knitting or baking with my old friends, they know I learned these things because I was raised as a girl; if I talk about the same things with new buddies, they become markers of queerness or femme-ness. And, as I\u2019ve discovered, I feel comfortable with being seen as a queer cis male. I thought that passing as cis might be sad because I\u2019d have to hide cherished parts of my past, but I\u2019m realizing that I don\u2019t have to hide them; they just take on new meanings which are also acceptable to me. I would like to disclose my past to some of my new friends, but the field in which I\u2019m studying is really small (so my present classmates will be my future colleagues) and information like this gets around very fast.\u00a0I never thought I\u2019d be able to stay stealth for so long \u2013I figured someone would see my student ID or find out through mutual acquaintances\u2013 so I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d even have this choice. I\u2019m taking my time with this decision because it will have long-lasting consequences; though being open about my past would be rewarding for many reasons, disclosures can\u2019t be undone. Edited to add: a few months after writing this (11/11/11) I disclosed to one classmate whom I\u2019d become very close with and who I trust completely. I\u2019m glad I did it. We ended up becoming even closer friends \u2014 in fact, he came out to me as queer right after my disclosure!", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 genderkid"}
