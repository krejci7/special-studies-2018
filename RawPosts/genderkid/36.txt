I\u2019d like to expand on most of these topics later, so I\u2019ll try to be brief. \u2013I\u2019ve been on summer vacation for the past few months. \u2013My parents are ever more embracing of my trans identity: they don\u2019t use male prounouns/names yet, but they try to avoid female ones. They\u2019re also helping me with tons of stuff: coming out to family, finding open-minded doctors, asking for a name change at school\u2026 I never thought they would be so accepting, so quickly. \u2013I\u2019ve found an endocrinologist who will work with me, although she has to send me to a hospital to get a T prescription (this week I\u2019ll find out if they\u2019re willing to treat me). \u2013The school year starts in a week. Although I\u2019m beginning my first year of university (!), I\u2019m going to take most of my classes at my secondary school. That\u2019s because the University of Buenos Aires requires a full year of introductory courses, and a few schools (including mine) offer those classes to their students. \u2013I\u2019ve been dealing with an anxiety/phobia issue that\u2019s probably related to transitioning. \u2013I started going to the gym, where I was consistently perceived as male.  I didn\u2019t like it much, though, so I stopped going. I\u2019ve been very reclusive and introverted for the past few months \u2014 my infrequent posting attests to that, as I haven\u2019t even been writing, let alone talking, much. I\u2019ve always prized a certain degree of solitude, but this level of withdrawal hasn\u2019t been good for my health. It\u2019s a hard place to get out of, so I\u2019ll start by trying to write a little more.", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 genderkid"}
