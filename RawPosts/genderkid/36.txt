Personal progress 
Here’s an update for those of you who’ve been following my personal journey (thanks for being there!). I’d like to expand on most of these topics later, so I’ll try to be brief. –I’ve been on summer vacation for the past few months. –My parents are ever more embracing of my trans identity: they don’t use male prounouns/names yet, but they try to avoid female ones. They’re also helping me with tons of stuff: coming out to family, finding open-minded doctors, asking for a name change at school… I never thought they would be so accepting, so quickly. –I’ve found an endocrinologist who will work with me, although she has to send me to a hospital to get a T prescription (this week I’ll find out if they’re willing to treat me). –The school year starts in a week. Although I’m beginning my first year of university (!), I’m going to take most of my classes at my secondary school. That’s because the University of Buenos Aires requires a full year of introductory courses, and a few schools (including mine) offer those classes to their students. –I’ve been dealing with an anxiety/phobia issue that’s probably related to transitioning. –I started going to the gym, where I was consistently perceived as male.  I didn’t like it much, though, so I stopped going. I’ve been very reclusive and introverted for the past few months — my infrequent posting attests to that, as I haven’t even been writing, let alone talking, much. I’ve always prized a certain degree of solitude, but this level of withdrawal hasn’t been good for my health. It’s a hard place to get out of, so I’ll start by trying to write a little more.
