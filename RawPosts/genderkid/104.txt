Genders in everyday life beauty dating fetish love self-esteem transboy transgender transman 
Every now and then, someone arrives at this blog searching for erotic pictures of nude transboys. I hope these people are young transgender men looking for info, and not cisgender people wanting to get turned on; especially considering that all the searches are for transboys and not for transmen. I’d rather not be the object of someone’s fetish. I guess it should be nice to know that there are people interested in dating transgender individuals. A lesbian friend once asked around, and she found out that all kinds of people —from lesbians and gay men to straight women— think transmen are hot. She says that even after transitioning we have a special, gentle way of being that comes from being raised as girls (ok, that’s a sweeping statement to make, but I was flattered). I’m glad to know that my dating prospects won’t be damaged by my gender, but I think I’ll have to watch out for people willing to date me just because I’m trans. I hope I’ll always remember that I’m lovable because of who I am, and who I am is not (just) a transman.
