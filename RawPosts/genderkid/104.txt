I hope these people are young transgender men looking for info, and not cisgender people wanting to get turned on; especially considering that all the searches are for transboys and not for transmen. I\u2019d rather not be the object of someone\u2019s fetish. I guess it should be nice to know that there are people interested in dating transgender individuals. A lesbian friend once asked around, and she found out that all kinds of people \u2014from lesbians and gay men to straight women\u2014 think transmen are hot. She says that even after transitioning we have a special, gentle way of being that comes from being raised as girls (ok, that\u2019s a sweeping statement to make, but I was flattered). I\u2019m glad to know that my dating prospects won\u2019t be damaged by my gender, but I think I\u2019ll have to watch out for people willing to date me just because I\u2019m trans. I hope I\u2019ll always remember that I\u2019m lovable because of who I am, and who I am is not (just) a transman.", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 genderkid"}
