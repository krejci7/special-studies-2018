Well, trans rights might be next in line \u2014 they\u2019ll be discussed in Congress in the next few months! The proposed laws would allow us to change our legal gender without surgery, hormones, or a diagnosis of gender identity disorder. Furthermore, they\u2019d legalize genital reassignment surgery, and have it covered by health insurance and the public health system. I don\u2019t know if all of these laws will pass, but I\u2019m really hopeful. To understand how important this is, consider the present legal situation of trans people. In Argentina, your name has to be in accordance to your legal gender, which you can\u2019t change unless your body matches up with a cis person\u2019s. So, to make my male name official, I\u2019d have to change my gender marker, but to do so I\u2019d have to take hormones, get top surgery, have a hysterectomy, and get some sort of penis through surgery. But genital reassignment surgery is forbidden, so first I\u2019d have to sue the State to have it allowed in my particular case; and that trial would involve invasive examinations by doctors and psychiatrists. The upside? If you win the trial, the public health system will cover your operation. The downside? Uh, almost everything \u2014 the requisite of body modification, the disempowerment of the citizen to decide for hirself, the cost and toil of suing the State. Some people have managed to dodge the requirements, though, for instance by promising to get surgery but not getting it. As more and more people win their trials, rulings are getting ever more flexible \u2014 some judges don\u2019t require surgery, others ditched the need for a diagnosis, and now a trans man managed to win his case without being on hormones. Something similar happened with gay marriage \u2014 before the law changed, several judges started approving individual marriages until a new law seemed almost inevitable. Also, gay issues became more visible at that point and they started being openly debated by society. Now it\u2019s happening with trans issues: not only are these trials appearing in the media, but there are openly trans people on TV (the latest edition of Big Brother includes a trans male who is by far the most popular contestant). If all the laws pass, Argentina will have the best legislation in the world on trans matters. It won\u2019t change everything \u2013discrimination wouldn\u2019t immediately end\u2013 but it would be one heck of a start.", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 genderkid"}
