Body Genders in everyday life FTM gender gendered menstruation period trans boy trans male trans man transman uterus 
A friend recently asked me for sanitary pad. Part of me wanted to get angry and say “why would you ask a guy for that kind of thing?!”; but then I realized that menstruation doesn’t need to be gendered. Sure, all sanitary napkins are marketed towards women, but when have (most) publicists ever been gender-savvy? I’m not especially proud of having periods, but I am trying to reconstruct them into gender-neutral occurrences; a side-effect of having a uterus (and low testosterone levels). Having a uterus isn’t half bad if it brings the possibility of giving birth, and having a vagina can definitely be fun. I don’t know if I’ll ever want a penis –more on that later–, but I definitely want to keep my vagina. This all reminds me of the Ani DiFranco song, Blood in the Boardroom, about menstruation: i say it ain’t no hassle no it ain’t no mess right now it’s the only power that i possess these businessmen got the money they got the instruments of death but i can make life i can make breath
