Part of me wanted to get angry and say \u201cwhy would you ask a guy for that kind of thing?!\u201d; but then I realized that menstruation doesn\u2019t need to be gendered. Sure, all sanitary napkins are marketed towards women, but when have (most) publicists ever been gender-savvy? I\u2019m not especially proud of having periods, but I am trying to reconstruct them into gender-neutral occurrences; a side-effect of having a uterus (and low testosterone levels). Having a uterus isn\u2019t half bad if it brings the possibility of giving birth, and having a vagina can definitely be fun. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever want a penis \u2013more on that later\u2013, but I definitely want to keep my vagina. This all reminds me of the Ani DiFranco song, Blood in the Boardroom, about menstruation: i say it ain\u2019t no hassle no it ain\u2019t no mess right now it\u2019s the only power that i possess these businessmen got the money they got the instruments of death but i can make life i can make breath", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 genderkid"}
