It\u2019s the only movie I saw that has a transmale character \u2013Aggie\u2013 so I had thought about showing it at school to help trans visibility (I still haven\u2019t found the courage to watch Boys Don\u2019t Cry). I looked for my favorite scenes and I noticed that the subtitles had typos: they said \u201cella\u201d (she) when referring to Aggie. But they weren\u2019t typos at all: every single time someone called Aggie \u201che\u201d, the subtitles said \u201cshe.\u201d Even when Aggie spoke, he used female words to refer to himself. I am very angry at the people who translated this movie. It\u2019s amazing how the ideology of whoever writes the subtitles can change a whole\u00a0 film: it can alter a character\u2019s entire gender on a whim. They ruined the only happy transmale character I could show my schoolmates. We seriously need more positive movies about us; or maybe any kind of movie about us. I know there are a few films out there, but they have severely limited distribution. And they\u2019re still only a few. Returning to the topic, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve seen a gaping difference \u2013involving LGBT people\u2013 between the subtitles and the actual dialogue; once, on TV, \u201cI know you\u2019re straight\u201d became \u201cS\u00e9 que sos un hombre de verdad\u201d (I know you\u2019re a real man). I was flabbergasted. In both cases, apparently, translators have the power to decide who is a real man.", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 genderkid"}
