I thought my answers might help someone else, so here they are: What was transitioning like for you? How long did it take before you could stand in front of a mirror and actually see yourself standing there? What does your family make of it all? What do strangers make of it? Was it worth it? So many questions, but they\u2019re all very personal and everyone\u2019s different! What was transitioning like for you? The hardest part, in my case, was figuring out that my discomfort was about gender issues, and then finding out how I wanted to live my life gender-wise. There were difficult moments later, of course, such as coming out in all the different spheres of my life, but they were limited to a relatively short time periods. Even the aftermath of each coming out never extended further than a couple of months; whereas it took years to finally feel comfortable within myself, and know what I needed to do in order to be happy. Once I figured that out, the rough spots of transition were tolerable because I knew they were taking me closer to my goal. Like Lucille Ball said, \u201cIt\u2019s a helluva start, being able to recognize what makes you happy.\u201d How long did it take before you could stand in front of a mirror and actually see yourself standing there? My own reflection made me uncomfortable for years before questioning my gender, though I had no idea why. But when I first tried thinking of myself as a boy, even before cutting my hair, I spent hours staring at my face close to the mirror, wondering \u201ccan I see a boy there?\u201d \u00a0\u2013 and I could (at least from certain angles, some of the time). After cutting my hair short, it got better; I could recognize my whole head as mine. Binding helped even further. The only thing I really struggled with about my reflection was my hips \u2013 they threw me completely, so I avoided full-body mirrors. A few months on testosterone helped immensely, but I think it was psychological because my body fat didn\u2019t shift that quickly \u2013 I think I finally felt comfortable enough in my body to accept it as a whole. What does your family make of it all? My family had a really hard time accepting the changes in my appearance: ever-shorter hair, clothes from the men\u2019s section\u2026 Living with my parents, it was a constant fight. But they finally worked through their issues (they did attend therapy for a few months) and, when I came out as trans, they had already done a lot of processing and were ready to take it on. That doesn\u2019t mean they accepted it instantly; but within a few months they were using the correct name and acknowledging my decisions. What do strangers make of it? I don\u2019t know; most strangers are in your life for a short period of time, so they don\u2019t really see how you\u2019re changing (though my neighbors think that I\u2019m two different people). The hardest group of people, for me, were the people I knew by name but who weren\u2019t my friends (most of my schoolmates), because I had to interact with them but didn\u2019t feel close enough to tell them about my transition; so they kept misgendering me. It was awkward. No one ever commented about my appearance, though, and trust me, my classmates saw me change radically. Was it worth it? This is the most loaded question, but also the very easiest to answer. Yes. I never dreamed transition could make such a difference in my quality of life; though I must\u2019ve known \u2013or hoped\u2013 it deep inside, or I wouldn\u2019t have done it. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t ask \u201cwas it hard?\u201d because I would\u2019ve had to tell you \u201cyes, it is hard\u201d, and I wouldn\u2019t be showing you the whole picture. Yes, it might\u2019ve be hard, but living is so much easier now \u2013seriously, you wouldn\u2019t believe it\u2013 that every ounce of struggle I\u2019ve gone through is worth it. Most of the time, now, I don\u2019t even remember the tough moments I\u2019ve gone through, and when I do, I\u2019d readily go back and endure ten times the strain, knowing what life is like now. I can\u2019t tell anyone what their (possible) transition might be like \u2013everyone\u2019s goals and contexts are different\u2013 but in most cases it is not impossible to change at least some parts of your life in order to feel more comfortable. Maybe it was just me, but when I first thought about transitioning, it seemed laughably infeasible. It took me several months to realize that the world wouldn\u2019t end if I started living in a different gender. Quite the opposite.", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 genderkid"}
