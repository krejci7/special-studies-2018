There are transfolk among the portraits, too; I recognized the Tender Hearted guy (Rocco) from Kael T Block\u2018s xxboys. Not safe for work: bare chests abound! One of the transmale models said: I had originally intended to just pose in my jeans and boots without a shirt but the morning of the shoot I was looking in the mirror at my reflection in a pair of black boxer briefs. \u201cF**k it,\u201d I thought, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna pose nude\u2026I\u2019m proud of my body\u2026I own who I am today!\u201d JeongMee Yoon\u2019s Pink and Blue project is a series of photos depicting a boy or a girl surrounded by all their blue or pink possessions. It\u2019s kind of eerie. In an interview, the photographer said: Girls train subconsciously and unconsciously to wear the color pink in order to look feminine\u2026 Some parents did not want pink colors, but the kids want it. Also, most boys did not have obsession about blue colors. Videos LGBtotheT AtoZ is an alphabetical collection of short videos narrating \u201cbiographies, pivotal historic moments and critical contemporary issues facing the trans community\u201d. They\u2019re pretty shallow, in my opinion, but good for a quick intro to new subjects. For instance, I hadn\u2019t ever heard of the Dewey\u2019s Lunch Counter protest, a trans protest that happened years before the Stonewall riots. This series come from the same channel that made Gender Rebel, a documentary about three genderqueer female-bodied people, one of whom turns out to be FTM. I managed to watch it some time ago, but now I can\u2019t because I\u2019m outside of the US (there\u2019s copyright issues). Hmph. Me Genderfork published my profile. If you still haven\u2019t visited Genderfork, do: in my opinion, it\u2019s the most important site for genderqueer people. It started out as an androgynous photo site, but it turned into a great, thoughtful community about fluidity, questioning and androgyny. Also, my coming out story is up at the Coming Out Stories site.", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 genderkid"}
