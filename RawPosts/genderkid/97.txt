So, how would I define my gender? I identify as a transboy/transman, or as a genderqueer guy, or as a genderqueer transguy. I no longer feel purely genderqueer, totally outside of the the male/female binary; I still reject the binary, but I identify with male pronouns, names and words (man, boy, guy; ni\u00f1o, muchacho, chico, var\u00f3n, hombre). However, I feel it\u2019s important to add the word \u201ctrans\u201d or \u201cgenderqueer\u201d to those male words. I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a while. At first, I wanted to differentiate myself from cisgender men because I wanted to have a totally different, self-constructed masculinity. Then I realized that there are all kinds of cis men: there is a hegemonic masculinity, but there are infinite others as well. So the \u201ctrans\u201d or \u201cgenderqueer\u201d part of my identity is there to mark the consciousness of my gender. I am male-identified, but that\u2019s a choice that I renew each and every day. It\u2019s kind of like femme identity: a femme woman is a feminine woman, but she picked that femininity consciously, not because she was pressured by society. I\u2019ll have to be careful not to fall into certain default patterns of behaviour \u201cjust because that\u2019s what men do.\u201d", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 genderkid"}
