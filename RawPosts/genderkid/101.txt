Now we can play video games together.\u201d Another friend responded in a similar, but more explicitly baffling, way: \u201cNeat. Now you have to be sexist.\u201d So now both these friends are trying to teach me about being a man.Which is kind of weird, because I\u2019m not transitioning in order to change my personality: I\u2019m transitioning socially and physically so that my body, name and pronouns fit my inner gender identity. I never had to try to feel like a guy. Besides, I couldn\u2019t be consciously sexist. I may not know how it feels to be a woman, but I know how it feels to be seen as a woman and treated like a woman; I know how it feels when society/family/school/media try to turn you into a certain type of woman. It can get ugly. I didn\u2019t want to be that kind of woman, but I don\u2019t want to be like the stereotypical man either, violent and insensitive and macho. There are so many kinds of masculinities: I\u2019d like to pick my own. At the same time, it\u2019s nice to be seen as \u201cone of the guys\u201d, at least in part (I don\u2019t think my friends suddenly started seeing me as male). Maybe, if they stop trying to teach me how to be a man, I can teach them a thing or two about women. I\u2019ve spent years undercover among them: I think I learned a thing or two that might be useful for straight guys (I may be totally wrong, though). \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 *I said I was changing my sex, even though that\u2019s a grossly inaccurate statement, because I wanted him to understand; when I try saying I\u2019m transgender, most people don\u2019t have a clue what I\u2019m talking about.
