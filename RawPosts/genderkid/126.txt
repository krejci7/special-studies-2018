By this, I don\u2019t mean that I\u2019m against labels. Excessive and compulsive labeling is dangerous of course, but categories help bring people together, and they can even make identities visible and legitimate. What I mean is that all categories \u2013queer, straight, butch, trans, man, woman\u2013 include both cool and not-nice people; so I shouldn\u2019t attach too much emotional value to any of them. For instance, I\u2019m reluctant to leave the \u201cwoman\u201d and \u201clesbian\u201d labels \u2013even though I don\u2019t feel too much like either\u2013 because of feminism and sisterhood and power to women. There are so many kickass people who are women and/or lesbians: Rosa Parks standing up (or sitting down) for her rights; Ani Difranco with her powerful, brave songwriting; Ellen Degeneres with her courage and wit. I\u2019m trying to convince myself that I can be funny, brave, and strong, too, without necessarily being a woman or a lesbian. Actually, just being myself \u2013regardless of how I present my gender\u2013 is the strongest, bravest, smartest thing I can dream of doing. I wanted to grow up to be a role model for girls, but I can be a good example for kids of all genders. I loved being gay because I thought it made for closer, more equal relationships; but I can be a loving, understanding boyfriend, too. Gender and sexual orientation are just the paint with which I\u2019ll color my world. So let\u2019s color outside of the lines.", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 genderkid"}
