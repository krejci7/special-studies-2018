\u2019 s just an anglicized  colonize  commodified utility that my sister have be program to consume  force them to cover up their natural state in order to imitate what another sister look like in her natural state because people keep tell her that the other sister \u2019 s natural state be more beautiful than the first sister \u2019 s natural state  At the same time  the other sister isn \u2019 t even in her natural state  because she \u2019 s try to imitate yet another sister  so in actuality  the natural state that the first sister \u2019 s try to imitate wasn \u2019 t even natural in the first place \u201d This remind me of queer theory and how gender can be think of a copy  copy with no original  It \u2019 s also interest to hear the feeling of the guy who \u2019 s hit on her  \u201c \u2026in the presence of this high be  the weakness of my masculinity kick in  cause me to personify my wannabe bigballer  shotcaller  God \u2019 s gift to the female species\u2026 \u201d Transcription  find here  after the cut  Slip of the Tongue by Adriel Luis My glare burn through her  And I \u2019 m sure that such action aren \u2019 t foreign to her because the essence of her beauty be  well  the essence of beauty  And in the presence of this high be  the weakness of my masculinity kick in  cause me to personify my wannabe bigballer  shotcaller  God \u2019 s gift to the female specie with shiny suit wrap rap like  \u201c Yo  what \u2019 s crackin shorty how you livin \u2019 what \u2019 s your sign what \u2019 s your size I dig your style  yo \u201d Now  this girl be no fool  She give me a dirty look with the quickness like  \u201c Boy  you must be stupid \u201d so I \u2019 m look at myself  \u201c Boy  you must be stupid \u201d But look upon her I be kinda feelin \u2019 her style  So I try again  But  instead of address her properly  I blurt out one of my fakeass playalistic line like  \u201c Gurl  you must be a traffic ticket cuz you get fine write all over you \u201d Now  she \u2019 s try to leave and I \u2019 m try to keep her here  So at a final attempt  I utter  \u201c Gurl  what be your ethnic makeup  \u201d At this point  her glare be scorch through me  and somehow she manage to make her brown eye resemble some kinda brown fire or something  but there \u2019 s no snap or head moement  no palm to face  click of tongue  middle finger  roll of eye  twist of lip  or girl power chant  She just glare through me with these burn eye and her gaze grab you by the throat  She say  \u201c Ethnic makeup  \u201d She say  \u201c First of all  makeup \u2019 s just an anglicized  colonize  commodified utility that my sister have be program to consume  force them to cover up their natural state in order to imitate what another sister look like in her natural state because people keep tell her that the other sister \u2019 s natural state be more beautiful than the first sister \u2019 s natural state  At the same time  the other sister isn \u2019 t even in her natural state  because she \u2019 s try to imitate yet another sister  so in actuality  the natural state that the first sister \u2019 s try to imitate wasn \u2019 t even natural in the first place \u201d Now I \u2019 m thinking  \u201c Damn  this girl \u2019 s kick knowledge  \u201d But  meanwhile  she keep spit on it like \u201c Fine  I \u2019 ll tell you bout my \u2018 ethnic makeup \u2019 I wear foundation  not that powdery shit  I wear the foundation lay by my indigenous people  It \u2019 s that foundation that make it so that past be globalize  I can still vocalize with confidence that i know where my root be  I wear this foundation not upon my face  but within my soul  and I take this from my ancestor because I \u2019 ll be damn if I \u2019 d ever let an American or European corporation tell me what my foundation should look like \u201d I wear lipstick  for my lip stick to the ear of men  so they can experience in surround sound my scream of agony with each lash of ruler  measure tape  and scale  a if my waistline and weight be inversely propotional to my value a a human be  See my lip  they stick  but not together  Rather  they flail open with flame to burn down this culture that once keep them shut  Now  I mess with eye shadow  but my eye shadow over this time where you \u2019 ve go at end to keep me blind  But you can \u2019 t cover my eye  look into them  My eye foreshadow change  My eye foreshadow light  and I \u2019 m not into hair dye  but I \u2019 m here  die  because this oppression win \u2019 t get out of my hair  I have these highlight  They be highlight of my past atrocity  they form this oppression I can \u2019 t wash off  It tangle around my mind and twist and braid me in layer  this oppression manifest  it \u2019 s stress me so that even though I don \u2019 t color my hair  in a couple of year it \u2019 ll look like I dye it gray  So what \u2019 s my ethnic makeup  I don \u2019 t have any  Because your ethnicity isn \u2019 t something you can just make up  And a for that crap my sister paint on their face  that \u2019 s not makeup  it \u2019 s makebelieve \u201d I can \u2019 t seem to look up at her  and I \u2019 m sure that such action aren \u2019 t foreign to her because the expression on her face show that she know that my mind be in a trance  As her footstep fade  my ego be leave in crutch  And rejection never sound so sweet  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013  \u201c For Butler  \u2018
