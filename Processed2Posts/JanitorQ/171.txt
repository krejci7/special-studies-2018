felt validate and joyous  in a chaotic sort of way  It be fun  we would not do it again  It be a different kind of experience for me  I be on a natural high for so long  it be start to get tedious  I mean  I \u2019 ve have a lot of extreme high and low in mood  over much long period of time  but this be somehow different  Somehow much less scary  I felt confident that even though I felt this way  I could depend on myself to do whatever it be I need to do  It be a high that be not really all that fun  in it duration  Maybe I be grow upHigh extend roughly  from Thursday  kick the planning for Saturday into highgear   till Tuesday  by then  we be in Northampton  MA for the start of our vacation  and the long drive to get there felt like it happen in a snap   I wasn \u2019 t hungry  I wasn \u2019 t sleep well  I be able to just keep go and go and go regardless  I didn \u2019 t particularly feel euphoric or excited  I mean  I do at time  but not sustain   I basically start feel like all I want be to get a full night \u2019 s sleep  an entire meal in my stomach  and to come down from wherever upintheclouds I wasOn our vacation  we stop through Northampton and Spencer  MA before head up to a tiny town  talk about a town with a church and a convenience store  No gas station   in central Maine  We stay with two friend who have an awesome cabin they \u2019 ve basically create themselves  over the past 10 year  It sit on 50 acre of land  and they live there part time  We go blueberry picking  organic   150lb      swim in a very cold lake  when the air temp  rain hit lake be even cold   trounce through the wood a bit  We kick back  do some reading  connect with our friend  and heard story about  meet some of their neighborsAt a rest stop on the way up there  I do an awkward dance with an old woman over the fact that I be in the woman \u2019 s bathroom  She spin around to walk back out and check if she be in the right one  sort of touch my shoulder to prevent a collision between u  say she \u2019 s checking that this be the right bathroom  I smile and say  \u201c Yep  it is \u201d This  surprisingly  do not happen to me often at all  I can \u2019 t even remember the last time  I enjoy the experience  since it wasn \u2019 t threatening or uncomfortable  be in a way validate   On our way back home  we stop to stay in a treehouse  And on our way from Maine to this treehouse  my partner read aloud an article from the August 4  2014 edition of the New Yorker  p24 \u2013 \u201c What be a Woman  The Dispute Between Radical Feminism and Transgenderism \u201d   I \u2019 ve never pick up a New Yorker before   I think maybe my partner hasn \u2019 t either  because she comment  \u201c There be a lot of comic in here  \u201d Haha   It have be give to u by our friend in Maine  because she know we \u2019 d be interested in this one articleImagine driving on wind road through rural VT  rain come down  have previously be bore out of my gourd  tire of our musical selection  And suddenly be fully engage in this topic that seemingly come out of nowhere  I mean  I know it come from the New Yorker  I just mean I wasn \u2019 t prepare for it  but it surely be a much need distraction right then   At various point  I interrupt my partner to argue passionately both with the article itself and with the radical feminists the article be aboutSome of the gist  \u2013 Not all  but some radical feminist still feel that transwomen be not woman and will never be woman  and that they benefit from male privilege\u2026    These radfems continue to want to exclude transwomen from womenonly space  and to invalidate their experience in numerous other way  They reject the notion that someone could feel intrinsically female or male  and that all the way that woman and men be different be due to sociological force and learn experience only\u2013 The common term for these radfems be TERF  transexclusionary radical feminist  \u2013 Some TERFs be detransitioners  and TERFs often cite detransition a proof of the fallibility of transgenderism   Expert report state that the percent of people who detransition be somewhere between 1  and 5   This be high than I would guess  but hardly significant enough to attempt to build a case   \u2013 Some TERFs face threat  both in their personal and professional life  Situations have become so escalated at time  that they must be escort by security to event and go underground in their academicsThere be so much more to this article  such a why FTMs be OK  but MTFs be a threat     Maybe I \u2019 ll return to the article for a more in depth future post   I highly recommend seek it out if you can  It be eyeopening for me because even though I \u2019 ve heard of this term  TERFs  and understand the basic of the argument  this really paint a picture  On the one hand  TERFs \u2019 argument be terribly weak and seem fuel by fear and a lack of understanding  with no effort to begin understandingOn the other hand  I find myself empathize  just a little   \u201c TERF \u201d be not a selfdescribing term  It be essentially yet one more slur  come from others in sexualgender minority \u2013 people all too familiar with slurs themselves  usually  These woman have fight passionately  sometimes for decade and decade  create groundbreaking groundwork  for change in the view of what it mean to be a woman  and now they \u2019 re kinda in over their head here  One final passage from the article that really sum up how this subgroup of radfems must feel  \u201c  These  radical feminist find themselves in a position that few would have imagine when the conflict begin  shun a reactionary on the wrong side of a sexualrights issue  It be  to them  a baffling political inversion  \u201d ",
