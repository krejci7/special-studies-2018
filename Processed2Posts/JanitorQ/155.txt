work a it relate to me continue to get what I need  Here be a few experience that  each take separately  be small  but a a collection of anecdote  be kinda mindboggling  \u2013 My first doctor initially try to sway me toward a different product  Fortesta  tell me I could save big  and hand me a discount card I could activate  I go through all the hoop only to learn I be not eligible because I be not male  When I come back to him with this  he change my prescription to Androgel without further discussion\u2013 Although I make clear to him that I be aim to be on a very low dose  and see what happen from there  like 12 pump   he write the script out a 46 pump daily  This lead me to be able to get 2 bottle at one time for  25  This amount last me for 4 month  At  625 per month  I wasn \u2019 t about to speak up about the inaccuracy  \u2013 The prescription wording have change over time  and between two doctor   and I \u2019 ve felt confuse a to how that equate to how much I \u2019 m get and how much I \u2019 m pay  I \u2019 ve pay  25 for 2 bottle together   50 for two bottle together  and even  50 for only one bottle at one point  I guess I assume it fluctuate in price  I think I be pay per bottle\u2013 I \u2019 m not pay per bottle  I \u2019 m pay per month  My payment  I finally find out  should be  25 per month  not too bad    but somehow I \u2019 ve continue to avoid even have to pay that much  I also have be able to store some bottle in reserve  which help me feel much more secure since most of my visit to the pharmacy have lead to some sort of question  call of my doctor office  etc  Not for anything personally about me  but because of how the script be write out   Basically  while talk to my insurance company  use the pharmacy \u2019 s phone  last week  I learn that all that matter be how the script be write  Testosterone be a controlled substance  I always have to pick up the prescription at my doctor \u2019 s office and show a picture ID  I can never get a refill  although my doctor have try   If the doctor write the dose out a 12 pump per day  the high amount be factor in  If it \u2019 s 46 pump  it \u2019 s 6 pump  even if I \u2019 m only actually use one  No one seem concern about whether the amount correlate to what I \u2019 m do  I can get a 30 day supply  a 60 day supply  or a 90 day supply  I \u2019 d prefer the 90 day because it mean I don \u2019 t have to go as frequently  But if it \u2019 s enter a a 30 day supply  it \u2019 s 13 of the price  And no one actually seem concern with whether that translate into how frequently I go to the pharmacy  Interestingly  I could pay a whole lot more to get the amount I use  or I could pay a whole lot less to get more than the amount I use  I don \u2019 t understand this logic  but I do finally understand this systemWhen I be tell I \u2019 d be pay  50 for one bottle and would have to come back in 2 month with a new prescription  for my 2nd bottle  due to the wording of the script  last week  I argue with that  The pharmacist get me on the phone with my insurance  which lead to me finally grasp how this work   I realize the only way around it be to get the script rewritten by my doctorI ask the pharmacist if I could get a discount card for Androgel  This be call \u201c The Restoration Program \u201d Due to my experience with the Fortesta discount card  I wasn \u2019 t hold my breath  The pharmacist get me start and then hand the phone to me to complete the activation process with an Androgel representative  He be friendly and smooth  I be ask a lot of question  name  address  email  phone number  etc  I be ask if I \u2019 ve read all the term and condition  Since I have just be hand the booklet with mass amount of fine print 2 minute prior  I just say  \u201c yes \u201d I be then ask  \u201c Are you MALE  \u201d He say the word  \u201c male  \u201d in such a harsh  abrasive tone  all customerserviceness leave his voice  I pause for a good long while  Repeated the question back to him  Said  \u201c No \u201d Said  \u201c I \u2019 m not legally male  if there be any other criterion under which someone could be male  I \u2019 m interested in that \u201d But his helpfulness be long go  I felt mildly humiliate  he just keep grind it in that he could do nothing far for meMy jade brain  during a conversation with my partner \u2019 s jade brain  haha  decide that men be reward for use Androgel because the company be try to promote a specific type of patient for their product  Rugged  middleaged  robust and vigorous  Masculine  Diagnosed with low testosterone  just need a boost  Just take a look at the pic of men on their website  Androgel websiteI be nothing like the men on the website  However  I be just a worthy of be eligible for a discount program  I would call it \u201c The Reimagination Program \u201d Testosterone have certainly aid me in reimagining who I be and what I can do  who I can becomeI tell the pharmacist I wasn \u2019 t eligible  He act surprised  but my jaded brain decide he already know  The next day  I call my doctor \u2019 s office  ask for the prescription to be write the way it have previously be write  Got a call back that it be all set  ready for pickup  Picked up the prescription  go back to the pharmacy  get my 3 month supply for  50  Anticipating more hassle in the future\u2026 ", "feedtitle": "Page 16 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
