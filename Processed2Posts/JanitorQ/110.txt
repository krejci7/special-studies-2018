support group in 20052006  and one of the facilitator put together this tape and make copy for everyone  It have 4 part  Parts 1 and 2 be from 2002 \u2013 a program on the Discovery Channel call Changing Sexes  My partner and I watch this over the weekendWe know it be go to be really bad  but we could not envision how utterly atrocious it turn out to be  This be only 13 year ago  and it \u2019 s amaze how far we \u2019 ve come  it \u2019 s like a public opinion time capsule\u2026First off  the term \u201c transsexual \u201d be use  and they get it wrong  They refer to FTM trans people a \u201c transsexual woman \u201d and MTF trans people a \u201c transsexual men \u201d Part 1 be about MTF trans people  and they focus on the story of 3 people  One be just come out  one have be out for about a year  live her \u201c real life test  \u201d and one be get ready to have surgery  A LOT of time be devote to her  Angela \u2019 s  journey toward surgery  they even follow her to Montreal and be in the operating room with her and her wife  Angela be 59 and have just recently come out and start take hormone  This last step would \u201c complete her \u201d  Her word   They point out how lucky she be  in that she could pass and in that her wife stayed with her  She live in Fresno  CA  and host a monthly support group in which people come from upward of 100 mile away to attendThere be a lot of sensationalistic soundbites  A couple  \u201c What push men to risk everything they have to become woman  \u201d \u201c Believing you be bear in the wrong body may be a delusion that win \u2019 t be correct with surgery \u201d \u201c Selfdiagnosed illness \u201d \u201c Watching a parent change from male to female be bind to leave a strong mark on a child \u2019 s psyche \u201d A therapist be quote a say  basically  that people may be convince they be a transsexual  but once they start the theraputic process  they may come up with alternative to have to go through a sex changeKenneth Zucker  from the Toronto Centre for Addiction and Mental Health  be on the program  basically say that transsexual tendency come from one \u2019 s upbringing  and that kid have developmental plasticity  even if there be a biological predisposition  I recently read this blog post  partially about Zucker \u2013 apparently he be still around  but his clinic be under review  and be not accept new patientsPart 2 start out with  \u201c The story of four transsexual woman  and their quest to live a men \u201d Someone name Thomas Wise  MD  from Johns Hopkins  be quote liberally in both section  More than once  he make an analogy to people struggle with anorexia  Basically  would you allow them to continue to make change to their body because they see themselves a too fat  No  Why should we allow people who see themselves a the other gender make change to their body  One of the story be about someone name Dirk  He be get testosterone through a urologist  and he be bind with a combination of ace bandage and sport bra  no mention of how dangerous this be   More sensational sound bite  \u201c What define a man  Can woman ever become one  \u201d \u201c Are they real men  Imposters  Or something else  \u201d \u201c She have start hormone injection  render him virtually unrecognizable \u201d Again  the segment focus heavily on surgery  both top and bottom   again with footage from the ORTwice  a study be bring up  from the Netherlands  in which scientist think they may have pinpoint a part in the brain  the BSTC structure  In autopsied MTF people  the size be close to that of a biological woman  and in FTM people  the opposite  Other scientist debunk the finding  say that it be the crosshormones that change the brain structure  It be unclear what find or not find this evidence might imply for transpeopleThis program be worthwhile in show human story  and that \u2019 s what I remember take away when I first watch it in 2006  Although it be invasive and sensationalistic  these be real people go through real adversity  and it felt important to me at the time  I tell a friend who be also in the group that I have unearth this video  and he say he have purposefully never watch it  I don \u2019 t blame him  I mean  it \u2019 s not something I would consider \u201c supportive \u201d of trans people   That \u2019 s a huge understatement   So for it to be give out at a support group \u2013 I mean  that \u2019 s all that be available at the time \u2013 it \u2019 s what be out thereIt \u2019 s reassure to see that public opinion be change  but there be still plenty of people who hold on to archaic notion about \u201c transsexuals \u201d Stay tune for part 2 \u2013 talk about an Oprah show about transgender child  and an A  E investigative report  Transgender Revolution  ", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
