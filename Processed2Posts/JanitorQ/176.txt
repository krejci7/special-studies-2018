warrant a post all to itself  I stumble into \u201c A Gender Not Listed here \u201d late Saturday afternoon  feel a little bit drained  but excite about the topic  which be go to be a summary and discussion of an article that be publish in April  2012  The information be base on finding of a study complete by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality in 2008  It survey 6450 TGNCGQ  transgender  gender nonconforming  genderqueer  individual from all 50 state  the District of Columbia  Puerto Rico  Guam  and the US Virgin Islands  It be by far the large sample size of this population to date   The presenter comment that they get a lot of flak from peer ahead of time \u2013 their colleague think it be foolish to put forth a 70 question survey  claim people would not fill it out in it entirety  To then see the number of complete survey that come back be really a testament to how much this community crave to be hear  to share their thought  opinion  and identity   So  to reiterate  the survey be for anyone who identify a transgender  gender nonconforming  Question  3 of the survey ask  \u201c What be your primary gender identity today  1Maleman  2Femalewoman  3Part time a one gender  part time a another  4A gender not list here  please specify  \u201d This workshop hone in on the 133  of people who answer question  3 of the survey with option  4  Most of the data be about how this statistically relate to other factor such a age  ethnicity  education  region  household income  and discriminatory factor  employment  health and health care  violence  etc   It be totally eye opening  I have no idea this data have be out there  for a couple of year now  Even just the knowledge that about 13  of people who identify a transgender also identify a neither male nor female  or live part time a such  be mindblowing  Not mindblowing a in it \u2019 s surprisingly low or surprisingly high than I might have imagine  it \u2019 s not   But mindblowing a in there actually be a statistical estimate out there  at least for the US  And why be this study not more widely know    I \u2019 m not go to pick apart all the detail of the statistical analysis  but I hope you might want to take a glance  Here be a summary of the report  break down really nicely  Check out this modified version  If you \u2019 re feeling ambitious and want to read the full 12 page report  it be here  Genderqueers  Gender Rebels  and OtherWise  A general overview might go something like this  Those people who write in their own gender tend to be young  more educated  less financially stable  and less likely to live in the midwest or south  and less likely to be white than their transgender counterpart  Also  it have be determine that  \u201c Despite their resilience and ability to define themselves in broad term and to hold  different  idea of identity in mind than conventional notion  overall Q3GNL participant face great discrimination  risk  and violence than their transgender counterpart in most of the survey categories \u201d Of course factor of privilege come into play  and it \u2019 s so convolute to suss out what factor may lead to or predict other factor  It \u2019 s simply a large data set from which future research can build from  That \u2019 s part of the beauty of it \u2013 this information be public  So  for example  if you \u2019 re a grad student who need a thesis topic  or you \u2019 re just really good at stats and have lot of free time on your hand  there be plenty of work still to be do and conclusion to draw from the raw data  Hopefully many will work with it in the futureOne other interesting point to highlight be word choice  Since the question make room to fill in the blank  the range of term for selfexpression end up be huge  39  of Q3GNL participant write in \u201c genderqueer  \u201d 95  write in \u201c bothneither  inbetween  or nonbinary  \u201d 22  write \u201c fluid \u201d \u2026168  choose another term all together  and that generate a list of over 100 unique word  phrase  include \u201c jestme  \u201d twidget  \u201d \u201c best of both  \u201d \u201c gender blur  \u201d \u201c cyborg  \u201d and \u201c genderqueer wombat fantastica \u201d hahaha  I know I write down a list of a lot more  at the conference  The presenter do a powerpoint presentation and
