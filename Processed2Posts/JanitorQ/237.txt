that it \u2019 s be a good chunk of time and it feel like these change be here to stayPain  I be in quite a bit of constant physical pain  mainly joint pain in my hand and arm  probably from repetitive motion at work andor not eat enough  Instantly  that be go  In addition  I \u2019 m just kind of suddenly get a little bit strong and work be way easier  Also  I \u2019 m experience sensation of pain a lot differently than before  Like  it \u2019 s unpleasant  Whereas before  the constant joint pain be unpleasant  but certain type of pain  basically  selfinflicted  be pleasant andor comforting  I \u2019 m not go to say I \u2019 ll never selfinjure again  but it do feel so far away from where I \u2019 m at right now  That be so amazing to me  I hat that I do that  even very recently  quite a lotHunger  Hasn \u2019 t end up be sustainable unfortunately  but seem worth note  I felt hungrier for about one week  early on  I think eat be a worthwhile thing to do  Briefly  I have chemical signal connect food with pleasure center in my brain  It be awesome  Like  I would think about and look forward to get to eat  I would prefer certain thing over other thing  by a lot  That quickly dwindle back to my normal feeling and attitude about food  which be not very excite  Not at all  Sometimes eating be a real chore  in fact  The one thing that feel different now be that if I skip eat at a time I usually eat at  I will feel more motivated to catch up  In that way  I will feel hungrier if I don \u2019 t eat  That wasn \u2019 t really true before  Also  I \u2019 ve gain 5 or 6 pound  which manifest in the one externally noticeable physical change go on \u2013 muscle growth  mainly in my arm  shoulder  pecs  and ab  Really psyched about this  Can \u2019 t go wrong with more muscle  Warm and Fuzzy  I just feel cuddly and cozy  I feel connect to my body in a way I never have before  It \u2019 s really hard to describe  but I \u2019 m sure people can relate  Like  my clothes feel soft on my skin  Like  I \u2019 m walk on pillow and cloud  yet paradoxically  I feel totally ground  Like  I have no idea how jagged and disconnect I be before  I have nothing to compare it to  These sensation have be dwindle over time \u2013 I think I \u2019 ve be get use to them  Like the cloud be not quite a soft and pillowy a they be at firstSex Drive  Having a sex drive I can relate to be awesome  Being able to have sexual thought and have that be connect to a body sensation  My body respond to sexual stimulus  Having totally different sensation everywhere on my body than I use to  in a good way  Clitoral growth  which mean actually be able to feel and experience erectile tissue sensation  Previously  junk be so small and sensitive in a bad way  it wasn \u2019 t all that funAnxiety  The big  most drastic change  be anxiety  totally go  Like general anxiety just disappear into thin air  I still totally overthink thing and mentally worry way too much  but the fact that those thought aren \u2019 t connect to physical anxiety response be a huge relief  I be exert so much energy on thing that don \u2019 t matter  I be feel so drain and limit by these feeling that I couldn \u2019 t get away from before  It \u2019 s a lot of work avoid thing that might trigger unpleasant internal response  now I don \u2019 t do that nearly so much  It be totally a brain chemistry shift \u2013 I don \u2019 t know how or why  but it \u2019 s not something I \u2019 m worry about haha  Also  emotionality overall hasn \u2019 t change much  I still have be experience the same range and type of emotion  which I \u2019 m happy for  If anything  there might be a slight capacity to acknowledge anger and frustration now  which seem positive  I \u2019 ll have to see how that play into my lifeI \u2019 ve be on Androgel  1   1 pump  125g  per day  I start with 162  for about 2 month  but I start to see some change that freak me out  voice drop and body hair growth   so I ask to switch to 1   Which I do for 2 month  voice go back to where it be  body hair growth stop   Then recently I start alternate between the two every other day  Which have be work out so far  and I like  I just hope I can continue to alternate my prescription  I might be question on that\u2026I have have some other slight physical change that seem common  I feel warmer  body temperaturewise  I \u2019 ve have some pimple pop up  particularly in place I wouldn \u2019 t normally get pimple \u2013 thigh  butt  armpit    I \u2019 ve be slightly sweatier  my partner would say significantly sweatier  haha  I want to be able to use testosterone for the rest of my life  but to not change much  physically speak  over time  if possible  So far  it do seem possible  The internal shift be too good  I couldn \u2019 t have even imagine  or dream them up  in advance  I \u2019 m still just hang out  revel in it all  One of the best decision I \u2019 ve ever make  ", "feedtitle": "Page 24
