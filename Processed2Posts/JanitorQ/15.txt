 This be great news  I feel less drained when I go out in public  generally  I \u2019 ve take thing into my own hand when I feel like I \u2019 ve need to  and this have not be psychically difficult  by any mean  Here be some way I have be true to my nonbinary identity1  I Tampered With My Driver \u2019 s License  Since I don \u2019 t live in Oregon or California  I still have to legally be either \u201c Male \u201d or \u201c Female \u201d Although I legally change my name to something more masculine  I opt to remain \u201c female  \u201d legally  This have lead to feeling of dysphoria  but be \u201c male \u201d would have anyway  as well  So  a of a few month ago  I decide to put a bright neon sticker over my \u201c Sex \u201d on my driver \u2019 s license  At first it be neon orange  Currently it \u2019 s neon green  The color doesn \u2019 t make too much of a difference \u2013 just the fact that no one can see whether it \u2019 s \u201c M \u201d or \u201c F \u201d be huge for me  I \u2019 ve show it at the pharmacy  buy beer with it  get \u201c card \u201d at restaurant  show it to bouncer at bar and nightclub  No one have comment or have an issue with it \u2013 they just need to know how old I be  and that I be who I say I be  That \u2019 s it   As an aside  when I travel abroad  I do take the sticker off  because I didn \u2019 t think TSA agent would be too thrill about that\u2026  2  School Pictures I be an elementary school janitor \u2013 every year  I go through the same routine  first day of school  winter concert  spring concert  curriculum night  open house  book fair  the 5th grade breakfast  last day of school  etc  No one can forget school picture  They happen within the first week of school \u2013 this year  it be a week ago  today  As a staff member  I have to participate  and then I get some free photo  and I get a sheet of all the faculty and staff  every year  In the past  I have go by the initial that I use to go by  which be \u201c KT \u201d and then  last name   Unless I wasn \u2019 t feeling like speak up  which be the case on a couple of occasion  I make sure the picture company have me down a \u201c KT \u201d instead of \u201c Mrs  \u201d \u201c Ms  \u201d or \u201c Mr \u201d This year  surprisingly  I \u201c pass \u201d a male  a I saw the picture lady write down  \u201c Mr \u201d and then ask me what my last name be  Without hesitate  I give her my last name  new  legally change   and then say  \u201c Can you change that \u2018 Mr \u2019 to \u2018 Mx \u2019  It \u2019 s neither \u2018 Mr \u2019 nor \u2018 Ms \u2019 \u201d She reply  \u201c I guess I can  \u201d and I watch her cross out what she have and rewrite \u201c Mx \u201d It be awesome  I kinda can \u2019 t wait to get my sheet of faculty and staff photo this year3  Playing It By Ear  As I Go This last one be a bit of a contradiction I \u2019 ve resign myself to the fact that I can not assert my nonbinary identity in every and all case  so  if people be give a headsup that I \u2019 ve change my name and pronoun  in some situation  that be good enough  Especially at work  Teachers have be great about switch over  And I honestly don \u2019 t know how many of them get the nuance I \u2019 ve try to convey  A couple of them for sure  because they ask me question  and I have some really satisfying conversation  But in addition to this  there \u2019 s a large group of people who be slowly hear about it  or not  by word of mouth \u2013 mainly building and ground worker  Electricians  plumber  HVAC specialist  people I see now and then  but certainly not every day  If they get that I be a transperson  and they be respectful  then  that be good enough  There \u2019 s this one guy who be over at our school a lot  A few week ago  he take me aside  and  obviously nervous about the exchange  he say  \u201c So  I just want to know  because we be friends\u2026 It \u2019 s Kameron now  \u201d He be just verify something he want to make sure he be get right  and  in my eye  I be really psyched about this because he \u2019 s a guy that I think other worker look up to  So  the more positivity around it  the good  The less nasty gossip behind my back  the good  And  to that end  I just go to a union meeting two day ago  and the secretary address me by my old moniker  \u201c KT \u201d I almost didn \u2019 t correct her  because\u2026 I don \u2019 t know\u2026 the pick your battle thing  I guess  BUT  Someone else correct her  someone that I didn \u2019 t know know yet  And so  I riff off of that  assert  \u201c Yep  it \u2019 s Kameron now  I change my name \u201d She shrink into herself at hear that  but  whatever  Another building and ground guy take it from there  tell me loudly that his \u201c niece \u201d just transition recently into his \u201c nephew \u201d We sit down and continue to converse so that anyone and everyone could hear  if they tune in  He be just overjoy to be accept \u201c Shane  \u201d his middleschoolaged family member  At no point do I try to assert that I be neither male nor female  If he get the gist that I be trans  and he spread the word with a positive attitude  then that be good than good enough  Acceptance  even if limit in understanding  be still worth it  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
