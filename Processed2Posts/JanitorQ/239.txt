relationship to our chest  I write a piece and never hear back about the project  I bug them 2 or 3 time about it and still get no reply  At the time  this be really difficult for me because the piece be come from such a vulnerable place  It \u2019 s just be sit a a computer file since then  but I \u2019 m pretty sure it belong here  Slowly dissociate from my breast  I use to have a lovehate relationship with them  but now I feel deeply disconnect and don \u2019 t think about them much  Unless I think they \u2019 re visible under my clothing  in which case I feel really uncomfortable and fixate on hop no one notice  I \u2019 m lucky they \u2019 re so small  I can get away without bind if I wear the right layer  So I do that \u2013 limit my clothing option to save myself from tense back pain  I don \u2019 t take that for grant  the fact that I do not have to bind  I use to cope with stress and frustration  fear and anger by cut my skin  I often end up focus on my chest  A lot of time when I be alone  I \u2019 d be topless and fizz with frantic energy  I \u2019 d envision their gory  bloody removal and bask in that thought  But I also love them  It felt good when they be touch  they fit perfectly and comfortably in the palm of each hand  They seem like they be a part of me  not a part of me \u2026 a part of me \u2026 not a part of me  FROM 51504  I be just want something intense to happen  Just by myself  here at the apartment  In addition  I have be obsess about the removal of my breast again  There be quite a while when I be ok with them  but I \u2019 m not anymore  So I have to pretend like I be go to cut them off  I use that knife and drag it in section to form a circle around both  Not deep  It hurt  No blood  but it \u2019 ll leave red mark  Like 2 bull \u2019 seyes  I kind of like it  but now I look at them and what I do be fuck scary  No emotion to match these action  Now though  I don \u2019 t act out toward my breast or dwell on the fact that they \u2019 re there  It \u2019 s sort of like I don \u2019 t really know them  Although sometimes I squeeze my nipple because it feel good  no one else can touch me anywhere near there  or oftentimes  anywhere on my skin at all  That chest be not a part of me  I get my first tattoo this past fall  The image be a scratchy line drawing  a symbol I come up with to express my connection to a deconstruct gender identity  It \u2019 s on my chest  below my right clavicle \u2013 to the right of my sternum  I think a lot beforehand  while think about placement  about whether to incorporate some pretty prominent scars\u2026 whether to see if the tattoo could hide them\u2026 whether to accentuate the scar line with the tattoo\u2026 In the end  I wear a tank top that would hide the scar from the tattoo artist  and have the tattoo place near them but not with them  Too much shame still surround them  they be too personal  The experience itself be exhilarate and euphoric  I be zone  reach a blissedout state  And also push thought of selfmutilation from my mind with every pulse of the tattoo machine  Hours later  I be out to dinner with my person  who have also get a tattoo that afternoon   and emotion unexpectedly flood in  Tearing up and unable to dissociate from the parallel between cut my chest myself and someone else inflict pain there  I talk about selfinjury and she look worried  She know that be in my past  but I have never really talk about it with her  I wasn \u2019 t regret the tattoo  I be realize that the experience have be trigger  no matter how tough I seem and how good it feltI \u2019 d like to get more tattoo on my chest  I fantasize about swimming  be shirtless  with a sweet chest piece on display  I be pretestosterone and presurgery  or be I nohormone and non operative  I have yet to know   For now I continue this nonrelating to my breastschest  Maybe someday that could change  Maybe someday I will have the chest I envision  flat and muscular  a male chest   Although I don \u2019 t feel completely male  I don \u2019 t feel completely here  in this body  either\u2026I write this in 2010  I \u2019 ve be feel differently about my chest within the past few month  which be excite  I have be increasingly want to get top surgery  for sure  at some point  But since be on this lowdose of testosterone  I \u2019 m not so concerned about it  It feel good to be touch there  Also  my pecs have get a little more prominent  maybe my chest be even small than before  For now  I can live with it   We \u2019 ll see what the future hold   Also a quick rant  If you be collect submission for a project  a rejection letter  email be 100X good than no email at all  Or  if you end up just drop the ball on your project  please let people who submit know the status  I be wonder for a long time what happen after submit my piece  ", "feedtitle": "Page 24 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
