and depression  He have be go through a really rough time for a while now  He need help and support so badly  and his dad do tooI look up local mentorship program to send to his dad because I really believe that if Ollie have a mentor in his life  he would have someone to relate to and to talk about what he be go through  Besides send mentorship information  I think there might be another way to help Ollie feel love and support right now  It might be a long shot  but I want to put it out there just in case you might be able to help me make this happen  I think that it would be so great and powerful if people who go through similar hard time and come out the other side  be able to write a letter to Ollie tell him their story and how they overcome their challenge  This young soul be in desperate need of acceptance and love and I would appreciate any help or guidance you can give me in help me make this \u201c Letters 2 Ollie \u201d project happenI go ahead and create an email account that I can give to his dad to share with him once people start write him letter  The email address be letters2ollie  gmailcom  I be hop to get about 30 but would be grateful for any amount to be honestI know this be an ambitious project and I want to thank you in advance for any help or guidance you can offer  You have my permission to forward this email to anyone you think might be able to help me make this \u201c Letters 2 Ollie \u201d project a reality  Thanks for your time  Best  Aldana Here \u2019 s what I write to Ollie  Hey Ollie  My name be Kameron  and I \u2019 m a 34 yearold transperson   Oh man  that make me twice your age   I want to write to you  share a little bit about myself  and hopefully learn more about youWhen I be 17  I be go through a really rough time too  I felt depressed  and stress out about try to make friend  plus juggle school  crosscountry running  and a parttime job   I work at McDonald \u2019 s  It suck   On top of all of this  I be put a lot of pressure on myself to figure out my sexual identity  gender identity question end up coming later for me  and to be more open and honest  I be really shyI decide that I must be a lesbian  since I be so masculine and it seem like I would probably date woman  although I wasn \u2019 t so sure about that  I didn \u2019 t know about transgender identity  I didn \u2019 t know of anyone who be trans  or even what that really mean \u2013 it wasn \u2019 t talk about at the time  and I didn \u2019 t know about any resource  I could barely come to term with the idea of be gay  anyway  so maybe it be for the best  To end up explore these thing in stages\u2026After a couple of month of feel such intense pressure in my senior year of high school  I break down and end up in a psychiatric hospital for three week  The rest of that school year be really really hard  I have to drop out of a few of my class  I go to more study hall and art class  but that didn \u2019 t really help  I be not able to focus on my school work or anything else  not even TV  Things do get good though  slowly but surely  I don \u2019 t want to sound too cliche  but it do get good  At least for me it do  And I think if you be to really ask people who struggle with depression and gender dysphoria and everything else  most of them would tell you the same thingMy mom be supportive  and she find out about an LGBT youth group that I start go to every Sunday morning   It prevent me from go to church with my parent  but I be secretly happy about that   I will say that I find it difficult to connect with people at first  because I be so shy  but I at least start to feel a little bit more confident at my school  At the time  my school didn \u2019 t even have a gaystraight alliance or any club like that  Does your school  When I go to college  a lot change for me  largely because it be an opportunity to reinvent myself  Everyone be new  Also  I learn about so many thing I be not aware of  include gender identity  Do you have plan to go to college  Even if you don \u2019 t  there be all sort of opportunity to be the person you see yourself a  even if most people know you a someone else right now  Whether you join a new gym or start a new job or join a new group  I feel like people be more and more accepting and understand about transgender identity  by the minute  these day  It \u2019 s really incredible how fast thing be changingI would not have believe I could be where I be today  when I be 17  the year you be bear  Were you bear in 1999   I change my pronoun to hehimhis about 10 year ago  I change my name socially  and I want to change it legally too  I be on testosterone for a few year  I just have top surgery 3 week ago  My transition have end up not be a straightforward  partly because I identify a nonbinary  but that \u2019 s a different story  Also  I get marry to a totally amazing person  and I have a blog  and I \u2019 m a radio DJ  and despite have some bout of depression at different time  I be usually happy and want to get as much out of life a I can  I \u2019 ve be think about you and hop that thing be at least get a little good  every day  I wonder if you \u2019 d want to write back and forth more  I \u2019 d love to hear about what kind of stuff you like  I just talk a whole lot about myself  but I \u2019 m actually more interested in learn more about you  Also  if you want to ask me something  go for it  I doubt I will think anything be \u201c too personal \u201d I \u2019 m pretty open  Your pen pal  Kameron ", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013
