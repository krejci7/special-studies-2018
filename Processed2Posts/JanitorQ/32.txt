"Content note  This post might not make a whole lot of sense unless you really like 70 \u2019 s and 80 \u2019 s music andor gender  And write and the English language\u2026In my city  there be two chaintype place to go to get an average oil change within about a halfhour wait  One also sell it \u2019 s brand of oil  nationwide  internationally  not sure   The other be more of a gas station  car wash placeFor the sake of anonymity  I \u2019 ll call them  LV \u2013 the oil specific place SD \u2013 the gas stationI almost always go to SD because my parent give me coupon for free oil change there  every xmas  And also because there be one on my way to  from work  About 3 year ago  I start try LV a couple of time  but I conclude that it be too expensive  and I switch backI be overdue for an oil change  but I didn \u2019 t want to go to the SD in the suburb where I work  cuz I don \u2019 t really want to be see out and about  while I be out of work for medical reason  So I go to one in a further away suburb  I have be there once before  and it be kind of anxiety provoking  in my head  at the time  Why  Because the style be Drive Thru  a oppose to give the mechanic your key and sit in a waiting room  \u201c Drive Thru \u201d be one of my long lasting fear  almost border on a phobia before I reign it in a few year ago  This include parking garage  anything with a \u201c gate  \u201d car wash  etcAnyway  I make it through no problem  but I be notice all these little \u201c masculine touch \u201d  masculine underlie communication  body language  etc  Stuff that \u2019 s barely worth pay attention to  Stuff I generally be not around because normally I \u2019 d be sit in a waiting room  An example would be a giant truck in line honking  just because he    want to get an attendant to come over ahead of time for some reason   As oppose to read sign to find out the information   These be all assumption  of course  but I \u2019 m just say I be in tune to thing in a different way than I normally would have be  And I be the opposite of anxiousWhile wait in my car  I be listen to a mix CD that a friend give me in our early 20 \u2019 s  Before he hardly know me  And now he \u2019 s one of my longestlasting  solid friend here locallyWhile hypomanic currently  I \u2019 ve be spend most of my time at home organizing and cleaning and catagorizeing thing  One thing I uncover be this mix CD  which he have title  \u201c A DRUM IS A THING IS A DRUM  \u201d  all cap   which  for me  be reminiscent of Wire \u2019 s album  one of my favorite album ever   \u201c A BELL IS A CUP UNTIL IT IS STRUCK \u201d  all cap   The song that stand out the most  from the others be  TRex \u2013 Jeepster  So GLAM  FLAMING  FLAMBOYANT  When the CD end  I could overhear what be play in the garage  mechanic dock  It be  Elton John \u2013 Benny and the Jets  SO GAY  Anyway  I get the oil change and then go to this place that use to be call The Stereo Shop  It \u2019 s now call something like  \u201c Digital audiophile visual environments \u201d I want to go there because there be a used cd  record store in the back of this high end Hi Fi Sound Equipment store  When I get there  I ask the guy at the front about the cd store  and he say it wasn \u2019 t there anymore  It have move  I ask if he could write it down for me  and he do  I don \u2019 t think any music be play in there  or if it be  I didn \u2019 t pick up on itBack in my car  I be listen to a station that claim it be the only station that matter  that \u2019 s their \u201c tag line \u201d  A song come on that be unusual for their roster  and also happen to be a song I sing along with  almost know by heart  That would be  David Bowie \u2013 Diamond Dogs SO GLAM  I get to the new location  and realize they didn \u2019 t open for another 45 minute  So I go down the road to another record store  When I walk in  what happen to be play  THE CARS \u2013 MOVING IN STEREO    In my book  it doesn \u2019 t get any more classic  fabulous than thatI be really just browsing  not look for anything in particular  A bunch of stuff pop out to me a \u201c must have \u2019 s \u201d I get a handful of 7inches  and a couple of recordsI \u2019 d recently start think I need to upgrade a few record  if I come across copy in good condition  because I be a DJ  That \u2019 s a Bowie song    and it suck to play crappy sound vinylFive day prior  I \u2019 d tell a friend that I probably need a new copy of Culture Club \u2019 s \u201c Colour by Numbers \u201d Me \u2018 n this record have a loooooong history together  It doesn \u2019 t get any more basic than that  Sure enough  at this record store  they have two option    Either  An original  still factory seal  for  999  or An original  still with the plastic plus promo sticker say \u201c Grammy Nominee  \u201d and \u201c All New Songs  \u201d  and then it list 4 song title  This one be  10 even  I go with the one with bonus sticker   PS \u2013  10 be pretty much the most I \u2019 m willing to spend on a record  and it good be pristine andor hard to find   Another excite find be  PETE SHELLEY \u2013 HOMOSAPIEN  Elongated Dancepartydubmix     Anyway  back to the story  So I buy this stuff and go back to the music store I have really want to check out  It be small and quiet  I think he be play music  but I have no recollection of anything playing   and there be just a couple of old dude come in and out  with special request and just to shoot the breeze  I be only there for about an hour  but I leave with a HUGE HAUL  I spend more on record and cd than I ever have before  mean within one store at one time   Almost everything I find be  5 or under  and it be an extreme pickthrough type situation  Meaning  don \u2019 t go look for anything in particular  just start look at everything  I have a nice conversation with the owner while he ring thing up  in a way so a not to distract him  haha  he be super methodical with his calculator and his mechanical receipt machine   I tell him he \u2019 s get lot of great obscure stuff  and I might be back within 6 month or a year or whatever  He ask me if I live here or be pass through  I say I go to his old store with my mom a lot and he then seem to maybe remember me  I say I do live here  I \u2019 m a DJ  I like 80 \u2019 s music  etc  It take him a long time to ring everything individually  so I start browse to pass more time  Found 3 more cd to buy  and then  a a last minute thing  the \u201c DAVID BOWIE \u201d category within the record pop out  There be two record in there  DIAMOND DOGS  pristine and currently hard to find  for  1598 and LET \u2019 S DANCE  pristine and currently hard to find  for  998I buy Diamond Dogs because that more or less completes my Bowie On Vinyl collection  no new pressing or record store day garbage  haha   I leave Let \u2019 s Dance behind because I already have it  but  hey everybody  LET \u2019 S DANCE  everybody  DIAMOND DOGS and BENNY AND THE JETS include  We \u2019 re all HOMOSAPIENS  we \u2019 re all JEEPSTERs  MOVING IN STEREO  sex and drug and rock \u2018 n roll\u2026All Capital LettersNOTES
