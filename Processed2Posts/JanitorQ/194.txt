wisdom \u201d be link to the name  \u201c Aubrey \u201d  f  and \u201c Avery \u201d  mf   They be of English origin  In the case of Avery  the meaning be derive from the Old English word aelf  mean elf  and raed  mean counsel  What do this mean exactly  Elves have make appearance throughout time in different culture \u2019 storytelling and mythology  most notably Germanic and Norse mythology  which may be the basis for today \u2019 s understanding of elf a helper to Santa Claus  of the North Pole   Not to mention Tolkein \u2019 s imaginings  According to Wikia  a website for fandom  \u201c The elf be originally imagine a a race of minor nature and fertility god  who be often picture a youthfulseeming men and woman of great beauty  live in forest and underground place  like cave  or in well and spring  They have be portray to be longlived or immortal and a being of magical power  In Norse paganism  Light elf be beautiful creature and be consider to be \u2018 guardian angels \u2019 Light elf be minor god of nature and fertility  they could help or hinder  human with their knowledge of magical power  They also often deliver an inspiration to art or music \u201d In contrast  \u201c The Dark Elves hat the sun and it \u2019 s sunlight  because if they be touch or expose to it they would immediately turn into stone  They use to annoy and threaten human  to the point that nightmare be think to be produce by the Dark ElvesThese elf could also haunt animal  especially horse  They be also know a dwarf  \u201c Elves be know to be playful  mischievous  and flighty  yet loyal and dutybound  So  to rule with this wisdom can only be a good thing  To \u201c rule with dwarf wisdom  \u201d if there be such a thing  might be something else entirely  I have not hear any followup from the Washington Post reporter in over a week  so I \u2019 m assume she go with someone else  I \u2019 m kinda bum \u2013 it felt like it would have be a good personal challenge  Maybe I \u2019 ll have more opportunity to talk with more people in the future\u2026 I \u2019 ll share the link to the story as soon a I come across itHaving the chance to talk with her via phone and then to think about the potential of her come here to hang out with me a I live my life definitely make some specific type of thought more pronounced  for many many day in a row  Mainly  what do I want to share with others  and what feel too vulnerable  Hypothetically  to what extent would I choose to be anonymous  These question have be on my mind quite a bit for a while  but suddenly it felt like I might need to make some definitive choice  And even though the pressure \u2019 s off on those decision  I \u2019 m still press myself about it  at least some of it  I finally decide to settle on a new nameThe name situation have be a thing I haven \u2019 t directly address but have think about for roughly 10 year  like a lot of particular about my gender identity   I do not like to go by my legal name  or the name I use grow up  Somewhere in my midtwenties  I skew it slightly  and that start to stick \u2013 almost everyone know me by this slightly masculinize version of a pretty feminine name  But ultimately  it \u2019 s not what I want  I \u2019 ve toy with the idea  offandon  of go by a male name  The big contender be Adam  this be my drag persona  and Konrad  just because I like it  But  I have to admit that ultimately  it would be too hard for me to request a name like that if I \u2019 m not ever go to be appear definitively male  I wish it be no big thing  And to many people  I imagine it wouldn \u2019 t be  and they \u2019 d easily make the switch  Just\u2026 it would be too awkward for me  I already knowIdeally  I \u2019 ve want to go by a name that be right in the middle of androgyny  I mean  a lot of name can be male or female name  but usually  they \u2019 re much more commonly use for one over the otherI talk to my partner about a potential new name about a week ago  This be a conversation we \u2019 ve have at other point in time  for sure  But it be always more whimsical \u2013 sort of like  what if  \u2026 This time it be more like  OK  I really need to pick now  I have this piece of write I want to submit to our local LGBT literary magazine  and it \u2019 s due in 3 day  and I need a pen name  That end up be pretty tense  note to self \u2013 don \u2019 t try to rush these kind of decision  Haha  But we get through it  she help me come to a name that I \u2019 m go to start use ASAP a a pen name  Avery  And if I still like it  I \u2019 ll start use it more and more online  and then if I \u2019 m still like it  the big switch to real life  which I envision will involve legally change it as well   But all that feel pretty scary  so for now  it \u2019 s just a pen name \u201c Avery \u201d definitely seem androgynous to me \u2013 maybe skew more to masculine  but feel like either  for sure  I look up the origin  what it mean  and that pretty much seal the deal  A few website confirm  \u201c the name literally mean  \u2018 rule with elf wisdom   \u201d Not sure if I could find a good fit    I be a known elfI rule allIf you pick out your name  how do you come to it  narrow it down    more evidencenever not an elf  ", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
