probably go to come off a the most unromantic love note ever  That \u2019 s OK That \u2019 s u  \u2026We have be together for close to 8 year now  We live together before we \u201c get together \u201d We meet a housemate  which be kinda an interesting way to get to know someone  if you \u2019 re consider ask them out  in term of feel out potential compatibility  A more detailed version of how we get together be here  if you \u2019 re interested  Happy Randomtimes  todayLast fall  we get legally marry  which I have a lot of mixed feeling about  It boil down to  We get marry for health insurance purpose  and other legal reason that seem unclear at this time  but may be super important at later time   We do not get marry out of love  Every day we be together  it be out of love  Marriage have absolutely nothing to do with whether we be together or not  It do not mean we be any more or less likely to stay together now  It doesn \u2019 t mean that anything about how we operate our relationship have change  Marriage be meaningless  So I guess I \u2019 m attempt to bring some meaning into it  because next Saturday  we be celebrate the fact that we get marriedI haven \u2019 t be in the best place  emotionally  the past few week  and that \u2019 s be make it feel like a struggle  to plan for this celebration  Which be OK  This party will happen  It \u2019 s normal to feel overwhelmed and nervous when plan something so big  Everything do not need to fall into place exactly how we want it to for it to be a good day  It \u2019 s go to be a good day because we be connect with people and with each other  And not because the sound system work without a hitch and no plate or glass get brokenBut there \u2019 s kinda more to it than that  We be celebrate marriage  and I \u2019 m struggle to understand what marriage be   Marriage be what you make it   Almost anything that be traditionally romantic  anything that be a traditional ritual for a wedding day  the role we play\u2026 I don \u2019 t get it  It \u2019 s not because I \u2019 m a contrarian or I \u2019 m \u201c too cool for school \u201d It just do not resonate  I don \u2019 t wan na play those game  In general  we win \u2019 t be  We \u2019 re have a \u201c ceremony  \u201d  er  2 actually  an opening and a closing ceremony  but it will be fairly aberrant  bent  queer  variant  deviant  We have no gift registry  Our photo album be full of picture of our friend and family  Scrap the scrap book  and the guest book while you \u2019 re at it  I could go on\u2026We \u2019 re discuss the idea of slow dancing to \u201c Everyday be Halloween  \u201d  Not because we wan na stir shit up  but just because that have be our wakeup alarm song every morning for about 5 year now   I love all of these idea  but I \u2019 m still not comfortable play the role of the person who be get marry  or already get marry  and be now on display   In a way  it feel like the party be just an idea a while back  and now have a life of it own  I think collect some of these thought be really go to help me outSo a note  to my partner  Hey  you  I like you a lot  I trust you as much a one person can trust another person  As time go on  I just keep find that we be super highly compatible  You give me huge amount of space and leeway to be myself  to figure out what I wantneed  to experiment  I couldn \u2019 t be in a relationship any other way  I know that I often hold myself back  so I can not be have someone else also do thatIt feel like we \u2019 re generally intune  insynch  we communicate about what be go on  regularly  And if we aren \u2019 t  we will be again soon \u2013 I don \u2019 t feel leave in the dark for long  And if I do  it be not worrisome  We \u2019 ll catch up with each other soon enough  I know I \u2019 m a difficult person  sometimes  I can be moody  and I generally need a shitton of alone time  in order to feel like a person  I make thing complicate when they be simple  That \u2019 s not easy to live with  You just roll with itI think that you be so super cool  You be a strong person with value I really admire  You stand up for yourself and for what you think be right  You \u2019 re not afraid of confrontation  You mold your life into what you want  We \u2019 re mold our life together  continuouslyLove  mePS At my most recent therapy appointment  I just keep cry and cry  that I couldn \u2019 t do this marriage party thing  basically   She suggest I write on my blog  where I \u2019 m comfortable  about it  before I \u2019 m in this lessthancomfortable situation  That perk me up  I say  \u201c That \u2019 s a pretty good idea \u201d She reply  \u201c That might be it for me \u2013 I might not have any more of those  I \u2019 ll take it \u201d I reiterate it be a really good idea  Also  at the end of the appointment  she tell me it be a freebie \u2013 a therapist \u2019 s version of a wedding gift  Haha  ", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
