transition goal  For a long time  I always know I would  could  at some point in the  distant  future  but usually it felt like there \u2019 d be no way  I \u2019 ve be rid the wave of my legal name change though  and get in on that a an opportunity to say that there \u2019 s more to it than just that I be go to go by a new name nowMonday \u2013 My supervisor have be out of work for 3 week  and Monday be her first day back  During her absence  I have receive the sign court order from a judge in the mail  and be start in on some of the bureaucratic process  go to the DMV  go to my bank  etc  So it be good timing for when she come back \u2013 I tell her  again  that I be change my name  and I defer to her in term of what she think I should do  I do not tell her anything beyond the name change  and she express concern that she wasn \u2019 t go to remember  I also come out to my 2nd coworker  my one coworker have be in my corner this whole time   She be emotional in her response  but I \u2019 m sure she \u2019 ll be fine  nothing will changeTuesday \u2013 Before work  I go to the \u201c third floor \u201d to speak to the benefit lady  I fill out paperwork  She ask me if I have my new Social Security card  and I be like  \u201c uhhhh\u2026 \u201d I make a mental note to get on that  She say we could get thing start anyway  without it  and I just send over a copy when I get it  While at work  I come out to my favorite teacher  It go well  The reason I like her be because she just seem real  We don \u2019 t talk a whole lot  but when we do  she \u2019 s always reserve yet super thoughtful in her insight  She share with me a couple of impression her 4year old daughter have have of me  she \u2019 s meet me a handful of time   That be nice  I tell her the name and the pronoun thing  but I didn \u2019 t get as far a \u201c neither male nor female \u201d in this interaction  It be good enough for me right then  she say  \u201c I \u2019 m happy for you  \u201d a couple of timesWednesday \u2013 I give it a day or two  My supervisor basically seem to think now I just wait for thing to trickle down from the \u201c third floor \u201d I wasn \u2019 t feeling that \u2013 I be feel more proactive than that  but I give it a day  I In the meantime  I email our union president  the benefit lady prompt me to do this  to give him a head up  We just have an election in November  and my favorite building and ground guy be elect  It \u2019 s always a building and ground guy  and if it have to be one  I \u2019 m so glad it \u2019 s him because I think he can absorb the news and take the lead on it within all those guy \u2013 electrician  plumber  HVAC  maintenance  conservative  white men  Trump supporter  etc  etc  HopefullyThursday  today  \u2013 I talk to my supervisor about when can I change my badge  stuff like that  and she reiterate that I just wait and it \u2019 ll all happen  What I be really most concerned about be talk to the principal  again   so that she hear it from me  and so that she hear all of the information  I know that once I talk to her  she \u2019 d take it from there  I \u2019 m not sure how she \u2019 ll do it  but the whole school will know through her   My supervisor say she mention it to the principal  and I take that a a green light  I come out to three more teacher  one of them tell me about a relative  and I be able to get to the part about \u201c not male or female \u201d with her  which felt great   I be feel pressure to talk to the principal either today or tomorrow because we \u2019 re go into Xmas Recess  and have everyone know when they come back from break would be ideal  So I make it happen  After school but before the admin  assistant leave for the day  I go to the office to see if the principal be available  The assistant principal happen to be with her in her office right then  which work out perfectly  Kill two bird with one stone  Plus  the dynamic with both of them be so much good  A lot of time  they be like foil to each other  I say the stuff  the name  the pronoun  the \u201c neither male nor female  \u201d  the principal bring up bathroom  which I have mix feeling about   the assistant principal bring the energy and excitement  but also bring up how he be not go to be able to remember  and that \u2019 s not anything about me  I say yeah yeah I know it \u2019 ll be an adjustment period   In my head  I \u2019 m thinking  how long be this adjustment period  exactly     Friday  tomorrow  \u2013 I have about 5 other people I \u2019 d like to tell in person  if I get the chance  If not  no big deal  Everyone \u2019 s gon na be focus on Xmas party and get ready for domestic family thing and cooky and blah blah blah  We \u2019 ll see  The best part be there \u2019 s really no more pressure  And so  that \u2019 s it  Now I just wait for thing to happen around me  Next week  during Xmas Recess  the only people who will be at the school will be me  my two coworker  my supervisor  and maybe the principal and assistant principal  So  that \u2019 s a whole week for the people who say my name the most  to practice  I have a feeling my coworker  ally will step up and lead it  follow by me correct everyone every single timeThen teacher and kid come back  And teacher will have a head up from the principal one way or another  and then I just start correct  correct  correct  For how long  Not sure   I get ta say  I definitely feel good and accomplished  but I don \u2019 t feel that \u201c wheeeeeeeee \u201d feeling that often come with big comingsout  I \u2019 m attribute that to my medication  for good and bad  It make so many thing so much easy  but those roller coaster feeling \u2013 yeah  I miss the good ones\u2026  ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013
