my chest  look down while everything be be unwrapped  I be pretty happy  Everything look good  except for the fact that the left side be large than the right  I be assure it be due to swell  and everything would even outNow that another week have pass though  I \u2019 m not feel it  I be more and more skeptical that there be much  if any  swell go on  My spouse agree  Regardless  I \u2019 ve be take arnica and bromelain\u2026 use ice pack a little bitRight now  there be not enough symmetry  in multiple regard  The areola be different shape  and they be too large  not \u201c nickle size  \u201d like we discuss   The nipple be also too large  but it \u2019 s kinda hard to tell what \u2019 s go on there  they \u2019 re currently be smooshed flat  and will continue to be for another 2 week   The big thing  though  be  I have different size go on  which contribute to the areolasnipples be not in the same place  on each side  I don \u2019 t like that  All these difference be fairly subtle  but definitely noticeable  I know it \u2019 s way too early to be come to conclusion about how thing look  but  so far  not so goodI \u2019 ve be in a pretty negative space  I \u2019 ve felt so negative at time  in fact  that it be hard to feel motivate to do all the showering and \u201c nipple care \u201d stuff  This have get well over time  Everything could change a lot  a I heal  I do recognize that  It \u2019 s not all bad  Every time I have the sterile pad and binder off for a little while  to let thing air out   and I put on a tshirt  carefully    I think  \u201c This could work  \u201d Excitement be there  somewhere  Sometimes I push down the good stuff  and remain guarded and reservedThere be something here though  When pick a surgeon  I wasn \u2019 t go off of a whole lot  I mean  I pore through what be available on transbucket  for sure  and search resource  youtube  and the like  But I didn \u2019 t really entertain all the possibility very much  in my head  I have a gut feeling about one route  and kind of just stick with thatThis isn \u2019 t the first time I \u2019 ve make huge  lifechanging decision in this manner  But I kind of hope it might be the last time   I know it win \u2019 t be  haha   There be good way to go about narrow down all the option  There be one resource that I just learn about a couple of day ago  because a fellow blogger point the way  Gabriel write a post call Getting Started With Top Surgery  He mention \u201c top surgery Facebook group where people share their result and story with their surgeon as well a the price quote they \u2019 ve paid \u201d Oh yeah  Facebook  That have not even cross my mind  unfortunately  So I just join an FTM top surgery group  and wow  this be where all the good stuff be  Wish I have know about it 6 month agoEdit  My spouse suggest I stop look at the FTM top surgery page for a while  That sound like a good idea \u2013 I be start to get obsessive about it  She say wordpress be good  Stop go on facebook  Haha  I agreeI feel torn about whether I will post picture or not  and if so  where  Before surgery  I be sure I would not post picture on this blog  but I would post them on transbucket  when I feel ready   They can be access if you create an account on transbucket   This still sound like what I \u2019 m go to want to do  I do not plan on ever be shirtless in public  So  in regard to aesthetic  the most important thing be how everything look while wear a tshirt  Other than people look up pic a a resource  the only people who be go to see my chest be my spouse and me  and medical professional  when necessary   So be it important what it look like  Ultimately  yes  But for right now  as long a I can wear whatever I want  I will be happy enough\u2026During my most recent therapy appointment  right before surgery  I have say  \u201c I \u2019 m worried my chest won \u2019 t look as good a it do now \u201d As oppose to say  \u201c I \u2019 m worried my chest won \u2019 t look as good a I envision \u201d That  to me  say a lotIn other news  I have a great time in Philadelphia with my mom  after my followup  We go to a brewery and record store  We meet up with friend at the Philadelphia TransHealth Conference and go to two workshop  Wish we could have stay long  Also  my spouse and I go to a wedding this past weekend  and it be a lot of fun  Their ceremony reflect who they be  a lot  and everything be casual and lay back  After the ceremony  I be ask to sign the marriage certificate  a one of the witness  This be a total surprise  I felt honor  I ask the officiant if it have to be my legal name  and she say it didn \u2019 t matter  Awesome  ", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
