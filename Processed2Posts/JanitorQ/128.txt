proposal for an essay to a new and exciting anthology all about the way transgender identity inform the internet and vice versa  My proposal be accept  and I submit my piece for edit in December  I be stoke  Unfortunately though  I just hear word that the editor be not move forward with the project  due to workload and pay work vs passion fill but unpaid work   So I figure I \u2019 ll publish it on my blog  Not nearly a exciting  but still something   I \u2019 m break it into two part because it \u2019 s pretty long  I be right on the cusp of Generation X  slacker  and Generation Y  millennials   I \u2019 m on the borderland of a trans identity  I \u2019 m on the verge of graspingrejecting technological innovation  I \u2019 m comfortable right where I be  hang out at the edge of all these precipice  Due to my age  gender identity  and complex feeling about technology  I find myself neither here nor there in term of what feel best  I continue to mix and match a I go  remain critical along the wayI be bear in 1981  which mean I most definitely do not grow up with cell phone or internet access  Even though they be available in the 80  we didn \u2019 t have cable television  a microwave oven  or a portable telephone either  picture a tan rotary telephone mount to the wall  with a long  coiled cord   I have always be wary of new technology a they slowly embed themselves into our collective landscape and my individual lifestyle  The transition never feel seamless  They always impact me greatly  imprint upon my memories\u2026The first time I use a microwave  I be a kid  I be at the grocery store with my dad  and there be a station where you could microwave your own bag of popcorn  Like many people do all of the time  even after 20 year of practice  we burn the popcorn  pop open the microwave door  and let the stench waft out  affect shopper within a 100ft radius  I felt mortify and ashamed  My dad seem unfazed  but we didn \u2019 t try againThe first time I use a cell phone  It be 2003  and I be a senior in college  My parent have give me a cell phone during our visit with no further discussion really  other than it be cover under their family plan  I bury it somewhere within my apartment and continue to use my landline  however infrequent that be   My mom later comment to me  \u201c We can never get ahold of you  Why don \u2019 t you answer your cell phone  \u201d Honestly  I can \u2019 t say  It just felt anxiety inducing  At some point  I must have get the hang of it \u2013 of be forever accessible \u2013 because I now be the proud owner of a Samsung flipphone and I carry it everywhere  I see the benefit of this  but I \u2019 m only partially on board  I rarely text  I keep my phone on vibrate  oftentimes I let a call just go to voice mail  and I call back when I be readyThe first time I use the Internet  We have a super slow dialup server call Prodigy  It be 1998  Again  I can \u2019 t recall any discussion amongst my family about what the Internet be and what can we do with it \u2013 suddenly it just be  I recall go on a message board to talk about music  I talk about REM with a stranger for a while before he abruptly ask me what size bra I wear  I felt a mixture of complex emotion before simply reply  \u201c an A cup  I think  I don \u2019 t really know \u201d He reply  \u201c Oh  that \u2019 s alright sweetheart  that \u2019 s enough for me to work with \u201d How do he know my gender  How do this space for nerd and fan devolve so quickly into a space for pervs to jackoff  I didn \u2019 t engage  just sign off  I don \u2019 t remember go back on the internet much after that until I get to college  my usage be very limited  and remain  in many way  fairly limit  even todayThe way I use the internet have definitely progress and shift  but I be far from the seamless IRLvirtual world many people appear to inhabit  I do not have a smart phone nor do I plan on ever get a smart phone  I have \u201c online time \u201d and \u201c offline time  \u201d and I need those two to be separate  You \u2019 ll never see me walk down the street  seemingly talk to myself or star at a screen  My trans identity have shift along with the way I view the Internet  over time  It have blossom and bloom  halt and shrivel  sputter and shudder and begin to bloom again  In term of deep soul searching  the Internet have never be my goto place to glean information  The library be that place  I spend countless hour  hour enough to rival Internet time  in the \u201c HQ \u201d stack of my college library  Specifically HQ 7179  \u201c sexual deviation  bisexuality  homosexuality  lesbianism  transvestism  transsexualism  sadism  masochism  fetishism \u201d For all that time spend search  I didn \u2019 t do a whole lot of actual reading \u2013 many of these book be so dense and researchcentric  I would often just go there to try to clear my head  Just sit  One particular book do stand out above the rest though  Loren Cameron \u2019 s Body Alchemy  Filled with stunning photograph and personal story  I could find glimpse of myself amongst these pagesStay tune for Part 2  where I flesh out these idea  fill in some gap  and really get into my transidentity a lot more  ", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
