part of the day Friday  and all of Saturday  In the past  I have get really overwhelm really quickly  and I have felt like I don \u2019 t belong  not because of anything specific \u2013 I think it \u2019 s one of the most inclusive and conscientious event for trans people from all type of background \u2013 but simply because I couldn \u2019 t really handle it  socially   This year  I do not feel that at all  I even meet 6 people  I be network  sort of     I \u2019 m go to list and summarize the workshop I make it to  and then just write a little more about the experience overall  Manning Up  No Apology Necessary \u2013 This be a guided discussion lead by 3 contributor to a new anthology put out by Transgress Press  They first read from their piece in the book  and then open it up for question and others to talk about their own experience  I like that this be not at all about what masculinity be  and how to find our masculine voice  but rather about personal growth  however that end up look like  in term of role and gender presentation  Another blogger write some interesting thought on this workshop  hereCommunityBuilding a SelfCare  Building a Movement  s  for NonBinary Trans Communities \u2013 This workshop end up be huge  The facilitator say they be only expect and plan for 2030 participant  and there be probably 150 people in attendance  As a result  the workshop be pretty unfocused  really only skim the surface  but that might be where these topic be at  currently\u2026 Things  in some way  be just get start in nonbinary community  I think that  or at least I hope  the conferencefacilitators will be good equip for these workshop in the future  It \u2019 s true \u2013 in past year  I \u2019 ve go to a few about genderqueer and nonbinary identity  and there be really only a few offer  and the turnout be not huge  Things be really change in this area in particular  Real  Unreal Worlds  A Fiction and Poetry Event with Rachel Gold and Stephanie  Stephen  Burt \u2013 Rachel Gold be a young adult novelist  the author of Being Emily  amongst others  and Stephanie Burt be a poet and professor at Harvard University  They both do some reading of publish and soontobe publish work and then open it up for question and answer  Stephanie get a little bit sweep up in her own work  which result in not quite enough time for audience participation in the discussion  It be a great workshop to attend for the morning though  when I wasn \u2019 t quite with it yet  to ease in to the day2014 Youth Panel  Seen and Heard \u2013 This be incredible and eyeopening  There be 4 panel member from very different background  age 1322  They each take turns answering question provide by the two  also youthaged  moderator  Then the audience have a chance to step up to a microphone and ask question a well  The room be pack  and a audience member step up to introduce themselves and ask something  it be clear they be here for all sort of reason  They be parent of trans youth themselves  they be pediatrician  social worker  activist  documentary filmmakers  etc  They be there because they want to hear personal story from young people  and help make change in their profession and their community on behalf of youth  Some of the story be really heartbreaking  nonetheless  the energy in this workshop be really amazingNo Longer Transsexuals  Not Quite Dysphoric  Who Are We Without a Diagnosis  \u2013 I find this topic to be highly interesting and  again  I leave with a sense that we \u2019 d only scratch the surface  The guided discussion  when we get around to it  be very stimulating  but quite a bit of time be use up at the beginning of the session go around the room  introduce ourselves  and say what bring u to this workshop   I \u2019 m talk about maybe half of the session be use up do this  I understand the facilitator want everyone to be involve  and they genuinely want to know why we be there  but this approach take too long   We then discuss diagnosis for insurance purpose  stigmas attach to diagnosis  the DSM and the ICD  the International Classification of Diseases \u2013 this be new to me    and how thing be do in different part of the world  A woman from India stand up toward the end  and talk in an impassioned way about how none of this applies to her and her country  And she go into detail about some gruesome condition in India  where it would be accurate to still refer to modification a undergo a \u201c sex change \u201d I \u2019 m glad she have the courage to tell u about it  from her own perspectiveA Gender Not Listed Here \u2013 I \u2019 m go to do a separate post about this workshop  soon  because I love it so much  So  this be just a teaser about that  HahaWe also attend the Blender  Showcase after the conference  on Saturday night  There be some really amazing and intense performance  in the vein of spoken word  dance  and dragMy networking accomplishment  I actually talk to some people  This be kinda huge for me  I don \u2019 t generally do this  I meet Rhys Harper  a photographer raise fund to do a nationwide tour  a book  and art opening  I meet and talk to two transguys from Transgress Press  I meet Ezekiel of firsttimesecondtimecom  And I meet two other internet friend  something I \u2019 ve never before experienced  We even go out to dinner with an internet friend  along with eir partner and another friend  and our friend from Philly  It be cool  We eat dosas  ", "feedtitle": "Page 19 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
