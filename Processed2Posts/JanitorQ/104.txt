warning  discussion of selfinjuryOn Monday  I travel to consult with Dr Rumer  and the appointment go well  In stark contrast  I have a terrible consultation with a local surgeon  at a cancer center  yesterday  She mainly work with breast cancer patient  and the mail  paperwork I receive in advance reflect this   The center could easily draft up noncancer related document for transclients   I be there for a total of an hour and 45 minute \u2013 lot of wait  When I get there  I fill out paperwork about my breast cancer diagnosis  I just put NA for a lot of it  Here \u2019 s a sampling of question I be prompt to answer  \u2013 What do you know about your diagnosis  \u2013 Previous breast history   Some cancer be more prevalent in person of different racial and ethnic background  The following information will help u to well understand your potential risk in develop certain type of cancer and to understand your prognosis   Followed by question about ethnicity   \u2013 What percentage of waking hour do you spend up and about  \u2013 more than 50  \u2013 le thank 50  \u2013 I be confine to a bed or chair \u2013 I be completely disabled  totally confine to a bed or chairOn the phone  when I schedule the appointment  the woman be sensitive to the reason I be come in  and to the fact I hadn \u2019 t legally change my name yet  Regardless  that didn \u2019 t translate over to the present day  and I be call by my birth name and even  \u201c Mrs   last name   \u201d I don \u2019 t think I \u2019 ve ever before be call \u201c Mrs   last name   \u201d I finally be bring up to the breast cancer suite and my vitals be take  I wait in an exam room and a nurse come in and go over some of the question with me  She leave for a while and come back  say  \u201c let \u2019 s fill out this paperwork \u201d This one WAS relevant to why I be there  I ask her  \u201c Why be I fill out paper for breast cancer patient  \u201d She reply  \u201c Oh  well  they just give you the wrong one down stairs \u201d No big deal\u2026    She leave and a doctor with an intern student come in  The doctor ask if it be OK if the student be present  and introduce her  She then ask  \u201c Are you soandso  \u201d I say no I \u2019 m not  She say  \u201c oops  sorry  wrong room \u201d I sit there wait a while longer and finally the surgeon come in with TWO student intern  At no point do she ask for my consent for them to be present  They introduce themselves and we get start  She start by put word in my mouth \u2013 \u201c So you \u2019 ve felt this way since you be a teenager  That \u2019 s when you start feel different\u2026 \u201d I just let her roll with that  She ask about mental health  suicidal thought  and even selfinjury  I \u2019 m not sure why  She ask very little about gender identity  I answer her question honestly  include that I \u2019 ve have vague suicidal thought  and I use to use selfinjury a a cop mechanismShe then say they be go to leave the room and prompt me to put the robe on  They be go a very long time  They all come back  rub hand sanitizer into their hand  I have a flash fear think \u2013 be all these people go to be touch me     Fortunately only the surgeon touch me  but the presence of all these people be enough for me to check out for this part of the appointment  A few thing that register  \u2013 She comment on my tattoo  ask if that be magic marker \u2013 it look like marker     \u2013 She talk a lot while I be sit there half expose  She describe the procedure she would do  and manipulate my breast in her hand to demonstrate it  I look down briefly  and see her grab my breast be totally surreal  She be talk at my chest  and not to my face  I be poke and prod a lot more than seem necessary  \u2013 She actually say to me  \u201c This scar  be this from cut  \u201d I could not believe I be be ask this  I be in shock  \u2013 I be aware of intern in the background  watch this whole thing  They be fuzzy  \u2013 I say to her  \u201c I \u2019 m just in the consultation phase  and I have some question for you \u201d This change the dynamic and she wrap up the part where I be sit there  vulnerableWhen this part be finally over  they leave and I get dress  I wait a very long time again  When they come back  I go through my list of question  She have a year and a half of experience work with transpatients  really      and do chest masculinize surgery a couple time per month  She require patient to be off T one week before and one week after surgery  50  of patient will immediately retain nipple sensation  and 80  will eventually over time regain sensation  She could not show me any example of her work that would be relate to my surgery type  She could not tell me how much it would cost  not even a ballpark estimateBefore leaving  I give her feedback  I tell her how I have be misgendered by the staff  She concede that they need to work on that  I also  in front of the student  say  \u201c As someone who be transgender  I have gender dysphoria around my naked body  These may not be the best type of appointment to have student present  It felt like I have an audience  and I didn \u2019 t feel comfortable be partially exposed \u201d She respond  \u201c Thank you for that feedback \u201d I understand she might not have control over when she have intern with her  but she could CERTAINLY ask for consent  or ask that the intern not be present for the naked part  I want to give her more personal feedback  such a  \u201c It \u2019 s not appropriate to comment on my body  \u201d but in the end I didn \u2019 t go there  I just couldn \u2019 t right thenThis surgeon and the staff could benefit from some transrelated training  particularly to the sensitivity transpeople may feel about their naked body  specifically chests  Make it short and sweet  ", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
