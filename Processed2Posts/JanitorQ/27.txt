thing that might make you squeamish  selfinjuryThree day ago  I do my 24th shot of T I start to psych myself out \u2013 for some reason  it suddenly seem superdifficult  The needle look extra long  and it have be look that way for a while now  I decide maybe I should stick it in a \u201c meatier \u201d part of my quad muscle  I do  and must have hit a vein \u2013 it HURT a LOT and it bleed quite a bit  I just felt like  \u201c Damn  I \u2019 ve be work myself up about the pain more and more lately  I just wan na do it like a routine  without any glitch  \u201d It then occur to me to look up the gauge online and see what be the range  I look at my ziplock baggie from the pharmacy  full of my syrinx  I suddenly realize that my new one be a different shade of green than my old one  I be look at 23 gauge versus 21 gauge  In addition  the 21 be 15 inch  and the 23 be 1 inch \u2013 my fear that I be gon na hit my femur be semilegit  I need to go back and get more 1 inch needle  pronto  Needles be scary  right  It make sense that people would fear needle  They hurt  Also  what about negative association to get shot at a doctor \u2019 s office  a a small child  vaccine and booster shot  stuff like thatAnd then there \u2019 s the taking of the blood  Like  say  you have a medical condition that cause you to need regular blood draw to make sure everything be on track  If you be transgender  this be a common best practiceWhen I be 1721  I have to get regular blood work do every 36 month  because of a psychotropic drug I be on  I can \u2019 t remember the reason why   To check liver functioning  and0r cholesterol  I forget   It be a hassle  at the very least  But I do start get very comfortable with it  I be present  it barely hurt \u2013 I just look away so I didn \u2019 t have to see the vial fill up with bloodBecause of this  probably  I be intrigue by the idea of donate blood  I do it a handful of time between these age  1721   both at my high school and at my college  It be one of the most bizarre thing  in my opinion  Here we be  a bunch of u  all lay down on cot  Any one of u might pass out at any time  and that would cause a chain reaction for others to pass out too  There be these nurse hover over all of u  make sure we can stand up OK a if we be rise from the dead  with these baggies of blood tie to u  They be on hand with cookie packet and juice box  We can have as many a we want\u2026The one reason I stop do it be because I have a hard time maintain the minimum weight requirement during college  110 lb   I didn \u2019 t have an eating disorder  per se  I just didn \u2019 t have an appetite or desire for much of anything at all  I also struggle with anemiaAnd selfinjury too  In that case  pain be my friend  I guess I can best describe it a  I would work myself up into such a frenzy that cut my skin felt like the only thing that would bring me down  I be hyperritualistic about it  It be a fairly common occurrence for year  but never \u201c severe \u201d And I don \u2019 t do it anymoreTestosterone have change my relationship to pain  for sure  I \u2019 ve write about that here  Differences In How I Experience PainHere \u2019 s a quick excerpt  I write this somewhere around 3 year ago   Before I start take testosterone  I have a peculiar  but not really uncommon  relationship to pain  In many case  I derive pleasure from pain  I would create sensation of pain  within my control  in an effort to calm myself  Also  when I \u2019 d hurt myself accidentally like for example  hit my arm on a doorway  I would feel alarm  follow by an adrenaline rush  follow by a pleasant soothing waveNow  If I hurt myself  it hurt  If I accidentally run into a doorway  it would not be pleasant in any way  shape  or form  I remember the first few time I get hurt in little way  in the first couple of month of be on testosterone  I be so surprised by how much pain be course through my body  I just felt like  aaaaaah  I \u2019 ve be swear under my breath and feeling unnerve by how much stuff hurtsSo what be I try to get at  I guess I just want to acknowledge that stick yourself with a needle  in an ongoing way  be a really intense thing to do  And it \u2019 s totally understandable that some transpeople would just have a hard limit and say  \u201c I \u2019 m not do that \u201d For myriad reason  So at least there be other option  \u2013 Gels  patch  and cream  unfortunately  quite costly  \u2013 Subcutaneous injection  not a deep  \u2013 Stuff like Nebido that \u2019 s inject every 3 month or soDoes anyone have experience with switch method  Doing selfinjections feel like a badge of honor  but I \u2019 m not quite sure that it feel like an \u201c honorable \u201d thing to do\u2026 ", "feedtitle": "Page
