purposefully progress at a snail \u2019 s pace  Example  it take me 10 year of deliberate to decide to try out testosterone  I have plan for other step I want  need to take  legal name change  top surgery   but I can \u2019 t see any concrete way those plan might be materialize in the near future  haven \u2019 t even socially change name yet  what to tell work about top surgery    Overall  this be OK  I know that ultimately I control the speed of thing  It \u2019 s not that I need all these thing ASAP  or  if I suddenly do  I could change my priority and get move    Fortunately  it \u2019 s not about wait on thing that be out of my control  bureaucratic process and medical gatekeeper and get fund together  It \u2019 s not really any of those thing  It \u2019 s all me  at least at this point  I need to be take thing this slowlySometimes though  I get really really frustrated and just wish I be where I see myself already  At this rate  it \u2019 ll be another 1020 year  At time  I get so super indignant that my identity feel so fractured  Why do it have to be this way  It \u2019 s society \u2019 s fault I be where I \u2019 m at  I want to be an actual person  in all area of my life  I try to remind myself that everyone be fracture  to vary degree  It \u2019 s not a transgenderspecific thing  Everyone have their outinpublic persona and their work persona and their laidback hangingout persona and the really good stuff that they only reveal to a select few  etc  And at the same time  it \u2019 s much more than a transgenderspecific thing  I \u2019 m too private for my own good  about anything and everything  I just wish  at time  that I could line up all my duck and without go through the effort  everyone would magically know that this be my name and these be my pronoun and this be how I feel and I plan on these change in the future  I \u2019 m in limbo about my name  The pronoun situation be get a little bit well  I struggle at time with feeling like a whole person  Sometimes I feel invisibleYesterday  I change my facebook profile to match who I actually be  a little more than ever before  A small change  but it felt huge  Me \u2018 n facebook  about five year ago  a few friend be urge me to join  I didn \u2019 t really want to  partially because I wasn \u2019 t out to this person and to that person  and there be no one way my profile could be that would make me feel both comfortable with not be out  and also happy  I be so private about so many thing  However  I think it might be beneficial to set up a facebook page for a performance group I be a part of  I set that up a if it be a personal page  a oppose to a group page   but it wasn \u2019 t really personal at all  And that \u2019 s how it \u2019 s be for 5 year  I \u2019 ve maintain the page  update about show  post picture from past show  etc  For a while in there  a friend and I be cooperating the page  The page be the group \u2019 s name \u2013 not my nameHowever  the group have be defunct for the past two year or so  I mean  we might put on another show at any time       but mostly  it \u2019 s inactive  Meanwhile  I \u2019 ve be navigate facebook in a limboland  I rarely ever post  I \u201c like \u201d other people \u2019 s thing a this group page  Profile picture have be performer  Sometimes the profile pic be me  but I \u2019 m \u201c in disguise \u201d Some people know that I be this page  and they tag pic of me accordingly  Others have probably be confuse  \u201c My \u201d birthday be list a the date of this group \u2019 s inception  It \u2019 s be weird and disjointed  but  strangely  reflective of how I feel in the world at largeI \u2019 ve recently be in touch with an old friend via email and he ask me about facebook  So I \u201c friended \u201d him through this page  He later write to me  edit for length   \u201c I assume you be \u201c hidden \u201d on facebook for a reason  but please know that I have have conversation with  mutual friend  and  your freshman year roommate  about your whereabouts  Please know that \u201c out of sight  out of mind \u201d have never apply regard people \u2019 affection for you \u201d That hit me hard  I simultaneously want to hug him and argue with himI \u2019 ve be try to improve this outlook for a while  and take charge of all these fragment feeling  Yesterday  I finally decide to make some change  I switch the profile picture to a pic of my face  for the first time ever  I \u2019 ve be take aback by how many \u201c like \u201d and comment this move have bring about  It feel good  I change my birthday and my gender identity  to actually reflect who I be  The profile be still in the group \u2019 s name  largely because 1  I don \u2019 t know if I want to easily be find by any and everyone at this point  Er  I know that I don \u2019 t  2  I don \u2019 t know what name I actually want to go byOne day  I will have a name  gender identity  pronoun  and a life that be accessible and understood by everyone  I have so far to go still  ", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
