account and speak to enough friend that I have this somewhat common narrative in my mind  someone who be FTM be primarily attract to woman before start hormone  Orientation then open up  shift  and this person now be attract to both  all gender  or be now more attracted to men  or even exclusively attract to men  One common idea surround this be that the person always be attract to men  if even just on a subconscious level   but could not fathom be intimate with a man  while be see a a woman  Another related idea be that the person identifies so strongly with be queer  that once he be finally perceive a a man  a new type of queer identity be now possible \u2013 one that may have be appeal all alongOK \u2013 I \u2019 m do with the generalizing  It \u2019 s super uncomfortable for me to paint broad stroke and write about a hypothetical person in such a detached manner  I just want to get some initial thought down  some type of framework in which to plug my own narrative into  Whether these idea be all that accurate or common be largely beside the point  The important part be that they be loom large for me  I have some serious fear about itWhile I be come out  sort of   a a lesbian  sort of   in my lateteens  I be mostly just befuddle  I didn \u2019 t really understand physical and sexual attraction  I think I be probably just a late bloomer  Now I understand that I \u2019 m probably a demisexual  Although this  somewhat recent  revelation be fascinate  I don \u2019 t feel a strong attachment to this label or a strong need to figure out my sexual orientation in all way  shape  and form  It never cause me to feel much of a disconnect from others  I mean  I generally felt a lot of disconnect from others  but I didn \u2019 t look to my sexuality a a way to figure out why that be  It \u2019 s kinda  meh  for me\u2026 Fascination  and not a whole lot more   Which be interesting because I usually love love love pick thing apart  Haha   I \u2019 m gon na jump over a whole bunch of year and land somewhere in my late 20  I \u2019 d be with my partner  she be a cisgender female  for the most part  for about 4 year at this point  and we be experience a longterm lull  We weren \u2019 t connect  Everything felt dull  foggy  I think for both of u  for different reason   I be feel more and more drawn to guy  all around me  and could not sort out whether that be because I need to be a guy  or if it be a sexual orientation thing  again  the lack of the physical attraction part be confuse  It be more of a cerebral thing   I kind of decide that it be both  I fantasize about a totally different life  where I be a guy  and I be with a hypothetical guy  However  I do not want to break up with my partner  I strongly felt that the tough place we be in be circumstantial and situational  and that we could work our way through it  I want to work our way through it  I wonder if a big key to work our way through it be  for me to transition  I felt this heavy burden of a circuitous fear  I need to transition in order to get out of this place and improve our relationship  if I start transition  my gut be tell me that I will be even more drawn to guy  and I will want to end our relationship in order to pursue thatI vividly recall  at one point  completely break down and tell her  while cry  that I be attract to masculinity  She didn \u2019 t seem surprise  or threaten  she didn \u2019 t shut down  She stay there with me  in that moment  and reply  \u201c one of the many pitfall of be in a queer relationship \u201d I appreciate that reply so much  in the moment  It felt like relief  Sometimes  I make thing overlyfraught  she bring it back down to earthShe have since elaborate that she do indeed feel the heaviness of the situation  Although we weren \u2019 t talk about all of this directly at the time  she recently tell me that she know  And that she be go to support me in transition  whatever that look like to me  unconditionally  at the risk of lose me along the way  WowWhile try to sort that out  some life change occur that vastly improve thing  My partner get a new job  we shift our approach to friendship  I go back to therapy  Our relationship improve by leap and boundsIt be about two more year before I really find myself at that crossroad of need to try testosterone  although I no longer plan to transition in that commonnarrative way   That fear be still there  Although it felt like we have a solid foundation to work from  I worry  would thing shift between my partner and me  Would I start to be draw exclusively to men  Where would that lead u  I start testosterone anywayTestosterone have change thing for me  but not in those way I fear  I \u2019 m attract to my partner and also I \u2019 m attract to men  Sometimes I \u2019 m attract to woman  mostly  I \u2019 m attract to androgyny and effemininity  effeminate men   I don \u2019 t know what that all add up to  I just call it \u201c queer \u201d The nature of attraction feel a little less cerebral  and a little more physiological than before  I like that  I think I still fall under the category of demisexual  for sure  but it do feel different  My partner and I talk about all of it  None of it be threaten to her  None of it feel worrisome to me  It \u2019 s all just puzzle piece  that  although not straightforward or common  make more sense to me than my sexuality have ever make sense before  ", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
