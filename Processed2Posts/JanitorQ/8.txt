in October  I be ask to be a part of a group performance art piece  an interpretation of John Cage \u2019 s Variations III  We be give a sheet of transparent plastic with 42 circle on it  Our task be to cut out each circle  take a 11 X 85 inch sheet of paper  drop the circle onto the white paper  clear any circle that land outside of the paper and also any circle that wasn \u2019 t overlap with another circle  Then we take a photo of our \u201c circle configuration \u201d Mine look like this  We be then suppose to distill this pattern into a \u201c score \u201d that would span 2 hour  include 5 minute break for every \u201c event \u201d According to the direction  \u201c Starting with any circle  observe the number of circle which overlap it  Make an action or action have the corresponding number of interpenetrate variable  1n   This do  move on to any one of the overlapping circle  again observe the number of interpenetration  perform a suitable action or action  and so on  Some or all of one \u2019 s obligation may be perform through ambient circumstance  environmental change  by simply notice or respond to them  Though no mean be give for the measurement of time or space \u2026 or the specific interpretation of circle  such measurement and determination mean be not necessarily exclude from the \u2018 interpenetrate variables \u2019 Some factor though not all of a give interpenetration or succession of several may be plan in advance  but leave room for the use of unforseen eventuality  Any other activity be go on at the same time \u201d So  in less dense term  24 performer be give a space of roughly 4 foot by 6 foot  all in one big room  And we could do any activity we choose  for a length of two hour  off and on  a be guide by our circle permutation  So  basically  I have 9 circle which mean 9 event  and I try to have each overlap \u201c dictate \u201d how each of the 9 event be structure  The performance be on December 1stI decide mine would be about do drag  There be really nothing else that make sense  Drag have be the only form of performance art I \u2019 ve do  and I be excite to  in a way  deconstruct and leave up to chance  the way it play outI bring an alarm clock radio with a tape player  100 cassette tap all in a display case  9 wig  hat  4 skirt  2 pant  one dress  a bunch of shirt and coat and belt and cumberbunds  4 shoe  boot  a makeup bag  4 \u201c microphone  \u201d a mirror  a blow dryer  and a hair buzzer  I think I be the performer with the most \u201c stuff  \u201d and over the course of 2 hour  I proceed to make a mess of all of it  within my space  This be reminiscent of any time I would do drag  After a show  my room would be a disaster of dressup optionsSo  for each of the 9 event  I throw \u201c circle  \u201d onto the ground  include cd  token  bracelet  and mason jar ring   I then pretend to have these circle formation dictate what I wear and what tape I play  In a vague sense  It all do work out in the end \u2013 I have 9 different outfit and 9 different song  all choose at random  Some of those included REM \u2013 Drive  XTC \u2013 Summer \u2019 s Cauldron  Tears for Fears \u2013 Shout  and Kate Bush \u2013 Jig of Life  I didn \u2019 t know these song by heart  so I just pretend to lipsynch  Due to the cacophony in the room though  I be the only one who could hear the clock radio anyway \u2013 I have to hold it right next to my ear  Other people \u2019 action include baking thing  bicycling  play instrument  create playdough art  play video game  read aloud  dancing  and much more  Observers just walk among u  It be unclear whether they be suppose to engage with u or not  One guy do come up to me and ask if he could talk to me  I say  \u201c Sure \u201d He say he think earlier I have silver lipstick on and now I don \u2019 t  so what happen  I say  \u201c Oh  that lipstick be so old it didn \u2019 t go on right  It be all clumpy  So during one of my break  I go to the bathroom to take it off \u201d \u201c Was that part of what be suppose to happen  \u201d \u201c No  \u201d And we both laugh  He ask more question about why do you do this  why not this  Afterward I talk to a handful of acquaintance \u2013 it felt good to be social  That guy come back up to me and say  \u201c You know  when you put on the lipstick  you really have me convinced \u201d \u201c Convinced of what  That it look bad  \u201d \u201c No  that you be a woman \u201d \u201c Oh  whoa  OK  so  I \u2019 m a little bit of both  As be all this stuff \u201d I gesture to all my clothes and junk  still strew about  My two friend I be talk to back me up  which felt awesomeI think ultimately  I be go for that response  for people to be confuse about what gender I be play out or not play out  So even though his forwardness make me uncomfortable in the moment  it be an important element  or \u201c takeaway  \u201d from the night  ", "feedtitle": "janitorqueer"}
