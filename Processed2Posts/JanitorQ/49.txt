call Transgender Universe  Here \u2019 s the first article that I \u2019 ve post  It \u2019 s about pride flag be burn in my neighborhood  follow the election  and then an impromptu rally  a a response to this hate crime   This first appear on Transgender Universe  here  From Burning Pride Flags to a Neighborhood Rally  The morning after the election  I wake up to a text from a friend who say  \u201c Hi  We \u2019 d like to get a rainbow flag to hang at the house in solidarity after what happen yesterday  Do you know where we could purchase one  \u201d When he have say  \u201c what happen yesterday  \u201d I figure he meant Trump  but once I get on facebook  I saw that two pride flag have be burn in my neighborhood the evening before  Talk about get hit close to home  It be be investigate a both arson and a hate crime  but so far there be no suspectsSo I look up information for the gay pride store that have be a mainstay in our city  first opening in 1989 a a leather and fetish supplier  and later change ownership a couple of time and morph into a place that have something for everyone in the LGBTQ community  I be shock and sadden to learn that it have close in August with the death of the current owner  So instead I recommend a couple of novelty store to my friend  hop he \u2019 d be able to track one down \u201c AS THE EVENTS UNFOLDED  IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THERE WAS NOWHERE  LOCALLY  TO GET A PRIDE FLAG BECAUSE EVERY PLACE HAD SOLD OUT  \u201d As the event have unfold  it become apparent that there be nowhere  locally  to get a pride flag because every place have sell out  A fellow neighbor have order 120 more flag  and she be formulate a plan to get these out to people and acquire more  flood the area with rainbowsOn Friday evening  another friend in the neighborhood have texted me to see whether my spouse and I be go to the rally in the morning  I feel fortunate that I have so many friend who be in the loop  because there be time when I be totally live under a rock    I say  \u201c Yes  \u201d a if I know all about it  ha ha   and we make a plan to go togetherAnd so  my spouse and friend  a queer couple with a 10 yearold son  and I walk over to a nearby park Saturday morning  carry sign and wear fun outfit  As we approach  I felt a wave of emotion  move by the size of the gathering  the amount of rainbow fly in the air  and the openness of everyone thereMary Moore  the organizer and the neighbor that order the flag  stand up on a table to announce the intention of this rally  to hand out more flag for community member to show solidarity  and to show LGBTQ member in this neighborhood how much support be out there  Mission accomplish  by leap and bound  There be so many ally and family  along with people who identify a LGBTQ  I walk around the outskirt of the crowd  take photo and scoping out all that be happen  There be a station for people to make rainbow out of ribbon  as well a a spot to make constructionpaper rainbow  Someone be do face painting  and there be also a place to sign up to order a flag  because the 120 that Mary have order for the rally have sell out in 9 minute  The director of the local gay alliance also stop by  get up on the table  and deliver a similar message of hope and love  I start to feel more comfortable  and move into the crowd and approach people with sign  ask whether I could take their photograph  I saw a couple of acquaintance  and where I would normally be too shy to strike up a conversation  in this environment  I go right up to them to say hey and chat for a while  My spouse and friend also connect with neighbor we know  as well a meet a few new peopleI post a photo album of the event on Facebook and watch my social network do it work  spiderwebbing outwards from friend I have tag  to friend of friend and beyond  I also message Mary  the organizer  to thank her and to ask her a couple of questions \u201c \u2026I LEARNED THAT SHE HAS BEEN AN ALLY AND SUPPORTER OF LGBTQ RIGHTS FOR A LONG TIME \u201d We talk on the phone for a bit this morning  and I learn that she have be an ally and supporter of LGBTQ right for a long time  even do advocacy work in Washington DC  She say that for the past 8 year though  she could ease up because there be someone in the White House who be push for the same thing  she could focus on her career  work a a lawyer in private practice  and on her familyShe first hear about the 2 flag burn incident from a friend  while pick her kid up from daycare  Her husband have hear about it through the website  nextdoorcom  which act a a community bulletin board and a way to connect with others nearby  I just join  myself  to see what it \u2019 s all about  and to try not live under a rock quite so much   Sure enough  5 day ago  there be a post from one of the victim of the hate crime  state  \u201c I hang a rainbow flag on my front porch and someone burn it down  Thankfully my house didn \u2019 t catch fire  The  police be  currently investigate  please keep an eye out for suspicious behavior in the area \u201d And then  a a response  Mary Moore create the event  \u201c Let \u2019 s Gather to Support Our Community \u201d She write  In response to the burning of two rainbow flag in  our  area  let \u2019 s stand together and show that our community be tolerant and welcoming  regardless of who you love  where you worship  where you be bear  your political affiliation  the color of your skin  or how much money you have  Many people in  our  neighborhood have be buy rainbow flag to put out in solidarity and to give to friend  \u2026 Would people be interest in organize a central meeting place this weekend or next to give out flag and just to stand with our community in solidarity  \u2026 Please comment below if you would be interested in a gathering like this  if you have or can buy flag to distribute  andor if you can assist with find a location for this gathering  If there be interest  then we can set up a formal event on hereI know that this be just one of many issue and injustice within our community and that we be all so very busy  but we have to start somewhere and do what we can with what we \u2019 ve get every day  Let \u2019 s not be bully or let our neighbor be bulliedIt all come together from there  I want to personally thank Mary Moore for show my friend  my spouse  me  and everyone else who could be there for how much we be support by our neighbor  Regarding our rainbow flag status  We don \u2019 t have one  but when we move into our house ten year ago
