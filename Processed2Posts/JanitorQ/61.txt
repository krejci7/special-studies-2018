guilty pleasure  it \u2019 s a straight up advice column  It \u2019 s call Dear Sugar  the \u201c Sugars \u201d be Cheryl Strayed  of Wild fame \u2013 the book  the movie  star Reese Witherspoon   the attitude  and Steve Almond  who write Against Football  among many other book and essay  They also always bring in an \u201c expert  \u201d or someone who can speak from personal experience about the person \u2019 s questionThey have field numerous letter about relationship  family dynamic  friend betrayal  wedding  lie and secret  infidelity  personality clash   surprisingly  nothing that I can remember about work drama or school issues\u2026  A couple of them have be about lesbian and gay centric problem  parent who be unsupportive  partner who be still in the closet  etc\u2026 I have be wait for something that relate to transpeople  Finally  after a year and 9 month  they tackle it  And\u2026 it \u2019 s totally underwhelmingHave a listen  here  I \u2019 m a Transgender Man  Seeking Acceptance  For reference  it \u2019 s 39 minute long   I mean  I think it \u2019 s great for the general population  So  it \u2019 s a good start  They read two different transmen \u2019 s letter  and they seem to be at different point in their transition  so that \u2019 s coolThe first guy be in college  and he \u2019 s feeling great about his path and the people around him and everything \u2013 everything except for his parent  who just will not get on board  This  I feel  be super commonThe second guy seem to be a little more establish  in a career  and he \u2019 s navigate the world of date  He be concern that since he be short  5 \u2019 2\u2033   do not have a lucrative career  social worker   and do not have a penis  he may be unlovable  This  too  seem like a pretty common concernThe \u201c Sugars  \u201d in general  use radical empathy a a basis for start a dialogue  And  in this case  since they don \u2019 t know how it feel to be transgender  they take the angle that  \u201c The best way to begin to understand an experience very different from your own be to listen to the story of others  This week  we read the letter of two transgender men who be struggle to find love and acceptance  The Sugars discus with Cooper Lee Bombardier  a visual artist  writer and transgender man \u201d According to his bio  Cooper \u201c have be a construction worker  a cook  a carpenter  a union stagehand  a welder  a shop steward  a dishwasher  a truckdriver  a bouncer  and a housepainter  among other thing  for a paycheck \u201d He \u2019 s currently super successful with the writing and the art  He sound super cool  Steve Almond start off talk about the first time he meet a transwoman  It be slightly cringeinducing  but also definitely a worthwhile story  Then they get into the letter  and introduce Cooper  He  a a guest  be eloquent and upbeat  but he do keep it pretty basic  and seem somewhat detach from his own personal story  There be a really great moment though where Cooper say he \u2019 s be \u201c transition \u201d for about 15 year  and when the Sugars ask him how old he be when he start  he say  \u201c in my early 30s \u201d They sputter about how young he look and how could this be  And he reply  \u201c I moisturize \u201d And then later  \u201c It \u2019 s the transfountain of youth  you know\u2026 \u201d and there \u2019 s lot of laughing  and Cheryl say  \u201c Sign me up  \u201d One thing that Cooper say really well in discuss the first letter be  \u201c We wrestle with these feeling for so long  that by the time we articulate it to somebody  it \u2019 s like a bottle burst open  \u2026And we tell our parent and we expect them to get it  like  tomorrow  Even though we \u2019 ve be struggle with it for year and year  right  And so I think that\u2026 it \u2019 s really hard to be patient when we \u2019 ve wait so long to kind of actualize and realize that this be what \u2019 s go on for u  But for those relationship that we do want to bring along with u  we do need to offer some patience  even though it \u2019 s hard \u201d When discuss the second letter  they telescope it out  to bring it to the wider theme of anyone who feel like they be unloveable  and how to change that internal notion  Cheryl say  \u201c This be a universal conundrum  \u2026Am I too fat to be love  No  Am I too poor to be love  No  Am I too fillintheblank to be love  No \u201d They touch on how his height and his career might factor into this  and no one make one further mention about the fact that he do not have a penis  Is it because they think it \u2019 s not important to talk about  No  I kind of doubt it \u2013 I think they be find it too awkward to address  Andor  in be respectful  they feel that it \u2019 s not up to them to talk about a transperson \u2019 s genitalia  or sex life  or surgery  or\u2026  which be definitely important that we \u2019 ve gotten that far  but in this case  it be right there  in the letter  and it just get straight up ignoredI do really hope they expand the dialogue about what it feel like to be a transgender person  I have be think of write in  for a while now  and I only feel more motivated after listen to this  I \u2019 m planning on it  I \u2019 ll let you know  ", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
