It \u2019 s due to an annual drastic change in my work schedule  and really no other reason  as far a I know about  I mean  I have other stressor go on  but nothing I can \u2019 t usually handle   This happen every single year  and it really affect how I engage with summer  I can always predict it  simultaneously  I always conveniently forget how extreme it getsI write what follow last week  when I be in the thick of it  And then I just sit on it  because I wasn \u2019 t sure if I really want to post it  Partially because it \u2019 s a departure from what I usually write about  Now that I \u2019 m feeling well  I find that  yes  I \u2019 ll post it  So  here \u2019 s what I write  only slightly edit  My mind \u2019 s reaction to longterm stress be terrify to me  I continue to wonder if this be really just how it be   Why can \u2019 t I just grow out of this      Some people get stressinduced migraine or upset stomach or struggle with insomnia  Anything like that be  without a doubt  difficult to deal with  In a big way  I be glad I be not afflict with those stressresponses  In some way though  a part of me wish for something like that instead  but only because it \u2019 s relateable and I \u2019 d probably feel like I could talk about it with others  \u201c My stomach be in knot think about what I have to do \u201d Or  \u201c I \u2019 m lose sleep over this \u201d These phrase be super commonWhen I get stress out for long enough  it feel like my brain be rot away  I lose brain functioning  not a figure of speech \u2013 my cognitive ability actually suffer in some big way   But more than this  It feel a if my brain have turn against me  I be bombard by vision \u2013 image of violence be inflict upon me  I do not know what I can do  I can distract myself  I can try stress reduction technique  I can  and do  follow through with inflict pain on myself in an attempt to stop the vision  None of these thing have ever work too well when I \u2019 m actually in it  When I be young  I be \u201c in it \u201d onandoff for year and year and year  It would become intolerable  It \u2019 d be beyond intolerable  but  of course  I have to keep wake up and live it  over and over again because there \u2019 s no get away from your own mindOften  my brain would feel so rotten that I couldn \u2019 t read  I couldn \u2019 t make sense of thing on TV or in movie  I couldn \u2019 t talk to people or follow a conversation  Eventually I couldn \u2019 t do any schoolwork at all   And it wasn \u2019 t about concentration  which be a common issue with people who be depress  It be specifically that synapses seemingly disintegrate   I make it through because luckily I have a therapist at home and a therapist at school  and they help advocate for me to get accommodation I need to not flunk or drop out of college  I felt like drop out  I \u201c get by \u201d with very high grade  because I couldn \u2019 t have live with myself with anything less     Does this make any sense at all  I be barely functioning  yet I somehow end up with very high mark  If my grade have end up slip  I would have be even more abusive to myself  Maybe the people around me could sense thatSomehow  I could still write  surprisingly eloquently  Although  it be limit to journalstyle writing  not academicstyle writing  Like what I \u2019 m do right now  When I can \u2019 t seem to do anything elseI get barrage with image span from mild  such a my face be slap or my skin be cut  to morbid  such a be hack away at with an axe  Or my head be whack repeatedly with a 2\u00d74  Or fall and hit my head so hard that I pass out  Or my neck be hold down a I be whip over and over and over again   These image be never sexual  They be disturb and unwanted  I seem to have no control over themI have hear of some people struggle with urge to actively do something they do not actually want to do  Like inflict pain onto someone else  Or step off the subway platform in front of a subway  Or drive their car off the road and down a steep ravine  There be an excellent graphic novel I would highly recommend that be largely about this compulsion  It \u2019 s call The Nao of Brown  What I \u2019 m talk about be so similar  yet strikingly different  I be never the one in control  I \u2019 m not harm anyone else or actively harm myself  It be always an anonymous person outside the visual frame  inflict violence on me  I \u2019 m the object  I \u2019 m look at myselfLast week I tell my therapist  \u201c whoever make brain need to try again  \u201d ", "feedtitle":
