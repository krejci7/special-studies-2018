think I \u2019 d read through some of my old blog entry  I come across a couple of pretty good one that didn \u2019 t get read by many people  because I be just start out  It take time and energy to build a readership  I think it \u2019 d be fun  and selfindulgent  which I could use right now  to \u201c reblog \u201d one of my first post  and edit it lightly   See if it still hold up  maybe make a commentary at the end  This one in particular be my 10th blog post  and it \u2019 s from a year and a half ago  I have be on T for 6 month at that point  It get 4 view  I think it \u2019 s of interest to more people than that  For over a decade  I have be go back and forth thousand of time in my head about whether transitioning  or partial transition  be right for me or not  At some point not that long ago  I seem to come to the conclusion that no  I wasn \u2019 t go to move forward because if I be  I would have do something about it by now  And I haven \u2019 t  so I \u2019 m not  I must be lack some internal drive  so it must not be something that I need to do  I settle on identifying a genderqueer and trans but not plan on medically transition in any way  But I be not quite satisfied  not at all actually  Because it be still on my mind  Sometimes just a whimsical musing in the back of my brain  Other time a pervasiveinvasive bodydysphoric consistent ruminationsI think it have to be all or nothing  I think I have to have a case ready about how I need to transition  in order to access testosterone  But I don \u2019 t need to transition  and I really don \u2019 t like to lie  I think I would need a letter from a therapist  and to jump through all these hoop  to access testosterone  at least in my town  locally  And I wasn \u2019 t even sure I want it  Eventually I reach a point where I just know that I need to try it  just so that I could know  So that at the very least  I could think about it differently or think about it less often  a it relate to a decision about something I should or should not doI have this awesome therapist  She doesn \u2019 t know much about trans identity  I \u2019 m fairly certain she have not previously have a trans client before  although I could be wrong  I \u2019 d be talk to her about this stuff  and she \u2019 d be follow along  more or less  in stride  When I would say I need to try this out  she would say  \u201c then why not  \u201d I ask her if she \u2019 d write me a letter if need be  and she say she wouldn \u2019 t be comfortable do that  she doesn \u2019 t have enough knowledge about it  Still operate under the assumption that I would need a letter  I start also see another therapist  basically for the purpose of get a letterThis second therapist give me the name of a doctor during our first session  Turns out that  apparently  I didn \u2019 t need a letter  Turns out I didn \u2019 t need to convince anyone at any point that I want to transition medically  I never once have to lie to get my hand on testosterone  And once I do get my hand on it  I be give the freedom to experiment with the dosing  basically use as much or as little a I want  Turns out I want to use as little a possible  Turns out I might be able to stay on it for the rest of my life without look any more masculine than I currently do  this have yet to be prove  but it \u2019 s be 6 month now  and so far  so good   And the internal effect  with this super low dose  be significant and pretty much good than I could have even hop forBasically  for all those year of wondering and secondguessing and processing and feeling anxious and obsess and daydream and doubt myself and ultimately sort of concluding by default that I wouldn \u2019 t take any step forward  actually do something about it have be one of the best decision I \u2019 ve ever madeAnd in retrospect  it isn \u2019 t like there \u2019 s no turn back  to some extent  Testosterone be a slowmoving substance in term of longterm changes\u2026 I \u2019 m really enjoy the internal forward momentum though  Now that it \u2019 s be close to two year on testosterone  I be at a new normal  I have use the gel every single day  and the benefit have be astronomical  BUT  I forget now  I forget what I use to feel like  I can feel myself approach a new stage  a stage where I look like someone in between  more so than I already be  This new stage might involve shave  or pluck chin hair at a fast pace than I currently do   It might involve a lot more explaining and come out  It might involve top surgery and a name change  This be my transition  in process  ", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
