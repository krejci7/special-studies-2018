one day I will  This be an abbreviated version  Over night  my brain become a frenzied jumble of free association  Every system I could imagine  friendship  technology  routine  open up  and I be in the center of all of it  connect all the dotsI think that Leelah Alcorn  the transteen from Ohio who commit suicide  be an elaborately staged message create by a group of people on Tumblr  Meaning  I think she be not a real person \u2013 more of a call to action  one more thing to add to \u201c The Transgender Tipping Point  \u201d and finally really make some change happenBut I think a lot of thing right around this time period  for a couple of day  I believe I \u2019 d be choose for amazing thing  I be choose my own adventure  and the further I could get before run into a deadend setback  the more reward I would gain  If I make it to my therapist \u2019 s office  she be go to give me this new phone I \u2019 ve have my eye on  If I make it through the entire day  I \u2019 d be go to a party throw by everyone I know  I briefly have the thought  \u201c My partner wouldn \u2019 t like that  that \u2019 s too much \u201d So my logic lead me to believe I shouldn \u2019 t make it through the day at this rate  I should definitely get the new phone  but I should see what my therapist thought after that  MaybeSome thing be already in motion  and there be no stop me  My social medium outlet be blow up  My blog be go to get huge at this rate  and I be go to get a book deal out of it  Should I quit my job  I kinda like work there  a a janitor  so I \u2019 ll keep my job  I better write a note so that everyone will know I wan na go back to work  I pull out one of those Mr  Sketch scent marker \u2013 it be Blue Raspberry \u2013 and scrawl out really big and doodley on a piece of artist \u2019 s paper  \u201c I will want to go back to work \u201d It be barely legible  When I show my therapist a few hour later  in fact  she couldn \u2019 t read it  so I just have to tell her I want to go back to work  I wouldn \u2019 t want to be someone who sit around all day  write their book  I would get bored  I call my therapist at 2AM and ask her  \u201c Can you just come over  \u201d I call her again at 7AM  just to see if she \u2019 d drop by instead of me meet her at her office at 9  I be make some really cool display in the house  and I want her to come check them out  I be play a record \u2013 The Days of Wine and Roses by The Dream Syndicate  and everything be click into place   Actually  the record be still on my turntable  untouched 4 month later \u2013 I \u2019 m play it right now   The lyric be make perfect sense and inform me of thing I should write down  \u201c You say it \u2019 s a waste  not to learn from mistakes \u201d \u201c Textbook case \u201d \u201c It \u2019 s Halloween \u201d \u201c She remember what she said \u201d These message be of utmost importance  This record be THE record to end all recordsBy 8AM I be so bored and fidgety from do stuff all night long  that I decide to take off for my therapy appointment early  I have everything I need packed \u2013 My toothbrush and toothpaste  note from work  and 6 bottle of hoarded Androgel  my prescription allow me to get more than I need  so I just collect them   I have no clue what would be happen next or how long I \u2019 d be go after therapy  I might be put up in a hotel    but I could figure out clothes and other stuff laterDriving be a bit tricky  I be rely on intuitive cue  more than the rule of the road  Fortunately  my gut be tell me to slow way down and put my hazard light on  rather than try to drive at the speed my mind be race  I still get there early  when I arrive  I slam my backpack into the corner of the wait room  above the door  To alert the security cameras that I know all about it  A man briskly walk past me and out the door  He be plant there to exit when I arrive  I proceed to be loud and messy  I dump out a bin of toy  I knock over a chair  I say  \u201c I \u2019 m borrrred  \u201d I talk loudly about a Mazda advertisement on the back cover of a magazine  I finally understand how advertising work \u2013 they weren \u2019 t fool me  In fact  this whole magazine be rig  I should just take it with me \u2013 I \u2019 ll need it later  I stuff it into my backpack  One other therapist be there  this be a Saturday  and she try to gently corral me until my therapist get there  She pick up the toy  She say she \u2019 d call my therapist for me  She talk to me in a steady and soothing voice  She wasn \u2019 t patronize meFinally  my therapist arrive  We engage in a delicate dance around each other  I know on some level that I be go to the hospital  But I also know that wasn \u2019 t necessary  and she be totally go to come over and check out my display and then I \u2019 d be reunite with my partner to proceed with the most fun day ever  In reality  my partner be on her way to North Carolina with family  I \u2019 d successfully convince her everything be fine  I believe she be just out with friend and I \u2019 d see her in a couple hour   My therapist start call hospital for availability  and I conveniently go to the bathroom to shield myself from that stuff  I come back and dump out all the content of my backpack  This would be more fun  She immediately sort thing into pile to make sense of it  She call my partner and leave a message  She ask me what my best friend \u2019 s phone number be and I tell her  I leave the room again while she talk on the phone  Before I know it  my best friend be there  Magic  Everything be go my wayI talk to my friend about the display and we play Rubix cube  Suddenly we be all leave  They lead the way  and I go into the bathroom again  I wasn \u2019 t so sure anymore  I yell out  \u201c I set some thing in motion  and I don \u2019 t know if I want it to go this far \u201d We be still just go to my house  right  My therapist reply  with force enthusiasm  \u201c Come on  \u201d I get in the car with her  my best friend go separately  I curl up into a ball and shield my eye from the world  I start to feel sad  I verbalize what I think about Leelah Alcorn  I say  \u201c I don \u2019 t know much about it  I know her name  where she \u2019 s from  and that \u2019 s about it \u201d She have be on the news  That be big  What I be try to convey be that no one know much about it  If everyone just saw her picture  her name  and her suicide note  maybe she wasn \u2019 t real  And maybe this kind of stuff happen all the time  What be real in the medium  Scattered thought break down  My therapist say  \u201c I don \u2019 t actually know where you live \u201d I reply  desperately  \u201c Yeah  but you can find out \u201d She have a smart phone  People with smart phone seamlessly glean information all the timeWe weren \u2019 t go to my house  When we stop and I uncurl myself  we be at the hospital  But it still wasn \u2019 t too late  If I just tell her this be where it end  and we go to my house from here  everything could still be OK  I look her straight in the eye  I put my face two inch from her face  I say  \u201c This be where it ends \u201d This have work with my partner a few hour earlier  I look her straight in the eye and say  \u201c Everything \u2019 s go to be OK \u201d I give her the green light to go on her trip  This time be different  My therapist probably interpret that a  \u201c The journey end here  at the hospital \u201d I mean here in the car  Still though  I comply and follow her  After all  my best friend show up here too  so it probably be all OKFive hour later  I be on the psych ward  I \u2019 d be in the emergency department  My mom have show up  I have talk to my partner on the phone \u2013 it finally sink in she be 6 hour away  and she and her family be turn straight around  My best friend have be with me  My therapist have leave at some point  I \u2019 d peed in a cup  I \u2019 d gotten blood drawn  I \u2019 d sign some paper by draw big loop over the entire page  not know what I be sign  exactly  But now  it be just me  and suddenly my choose your own adventure have come to a dead halt  There be no more choosing  I start yell  panic  \u201c I NEED MY VITAMIN D PILL AND ELDERBERRY SUPPLEMENT  \u201d I need to maintain my body \u2019 s delicate homeostatic state  I be give a pill and take it  it be Haldol  It knock me out for 18 hour  Before I fade out  the nurse be talk to me really sternly  She be really butch  \u201c Do not start shout on my unit \u2013 we don \u2019 t do that \u201d \u201c I know I know it \u2019 s not like me at all\u2026 \u201d \u201c Also  you smell really strongly bad so I \u2019 m go to shut your door \u201d Then she start yell  \u201c He get whatever he want  \u201d And I be out  ", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
