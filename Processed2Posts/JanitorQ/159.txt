go to a vegan restaurant  book store  art museum  Mediterranean restaurant  and then to the event  It be a blast  nice to get out of town  The art museum portion of the day be totally bizarre and surreal  The docent seem surprised we want to pay the full  5 each suggest donation  No one else be in the museum except for her and a very friendly  and bore   security guard  Or so we think  until we head toward the stairway to the bottom floor \u2013 there be loud banging noise and the sound of scream child en masse  I just keep visualize a stampede of schoolaged child horse around and slam into the glass case housing invaluable ceramic  I wasn \u2019 t too far off \u2013 it be indeed a stampede of child  but they be contain within a \u201c play area \u201d priceless ceramic piece  1priceless ceramic piece  2We wander around for a solid 2 hour  and be trail by the guard for much of that time  She make sure to let u know we could take photo of the ceramic  as long a we didn \u2019 t use flash  She point out some specific one to u  comment  \u201c this one fool a lot of people  \u201d etc  She ask u if we \u2019 ve ever hear a player piano before  part of one of the exhibit  and we felt obligate to follow her back into a room we \u2019 d already be in  because the piano be roll out the music  I ask her how many time the piano kick on per day  She say  \u201c three or four \u201d There be an AV exhibit where you could record a 10 second digital video of yourself  while manipulate special effect  So  we go ahead and do that  and playback mode show what you just record  follow by everyone else \u2019 s segments\u2026 Our block be follow by 10 second of the guard  pace the room at a slight distance  all pixelated and swoop  she must have record herself earlier in the day   It be a distorted version of our real life experience  at the art museum  It be a momentThe gallery event be incredible  Very well attend  Lots of snack and drink  I usually make a beeline for the free snack at these kind of thing   Seeing these image  many of which I \u2019 ve see online  on these white wall  in person  felt really powerful  There \u2019 s an Episcopal nun  A fire fighter  An exmilitary person  A cat rescuer  A MMA fighter  A DJ  And so many more  I think Rhys \u2019 s project be go to go far  He \u2019 s already go far  He recognize me right away  and we talk far about my be photograph in the future  We also talk about be introvert and stuff like that  He invite u to an afterparty outing which be super nice  but we politely decline  since my partner and I be such introvert  Haha   me and Rhys  The opening be a joint effort with Gavin Rouille  a conceptual and graphic artist living in Minneapolis  gavinlaurencerouillewordpresscom  If you go to his

stuff be all on his website as well   The text on the card read  \u201c Dear friend  I be a boy  I be sure you do not realize this when you call me  \u2018 lady  girl  miss  she  her  or ma \u2019 am \u2019 In the past I have attempt to alert people of my gender identity in advance  Unfortunately  this cause them to react to me a pushy  or socially inappropriate  Therefore  my policy be to assume people don \u2019 t make these assumption about me  and to distribute this card when they do  I regret any discomfort my presence be cause you just a I be sure you regret the discomfort your assumption be cause me \u201d Edit  I JUST saw this  this article about Rhys \u2019 s photo be publish 2 hour ago in Cosmo       Cosmopolitan article  14 Beautiful Photos That Will Change How You See
