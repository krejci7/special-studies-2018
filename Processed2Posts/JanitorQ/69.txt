my first post on this blog  It be this  lowdose testosterone for the rest of my lifeAt that point  I be feel very unsure of myself  It be more like  \u201c lowdose testosterone for the rest of my life    \u201d Being able to do that be of utmost importance  it be something I be strongly identify with  But  if too many physical change be happen and I didn \u2019 t like it  I felt like that mean I fail  I hadn \u2019 t heard of anyone else try to maintain an inbetweenness through hormone before  The only resource online I could find at the time be this series  through the Original Plumbing blog  I Was a Teenage UnicornI have also meet Micah at the Philly TransHealth Conference  His blog be a goldmine of informationI decide to start my own blog  to add to the conversation  And I really could not have fathom how much it would help me connect with others and gain confidence in my choice  Thanks for connect with me  everyone    There \u2019 s really nothing like it  at least for me  a someone who express myself easy through writing and like to read what be go on in other people \u2019 s headsThree year later  I already haven \u2019 t be on lowdose testosterone for the rest of my life  but that \u2019 s no big deal in the large picture  I can now see  I have be off of it for about 6 month  Actually  a of 5 day ago  I be back on it  on a daybyday basis  just because I feel like itSo  to celebrate 3 year  I think I \u2019 d pick out a few post  and then also talk about some future write goalsAccording to my stats  my top 5 most visited post be these  28 risk of chest binding \u2013 I write this recently  And then I post link to it on a couple of facebook group  first time I \u2019 ve really do that   and it kinda take off  This be probably the close I \u2019 ve get to \u201c go viral  \u201d haha  It have 3 time a many view a my next popular post  which be  Can hormone change my sexual orientation  \u2013 I write this early on  and I \u2019 m glad it continue to get a lot of traffic on a steady basis  A lot of people be curious about if and how hormone could maybe shift sexual orientation  Bathroom anxiety  a genderqueer janitor \u2019 s perspective \u2013 I also write this early on  and I think that if I be to write it over again  there would be lot of edits  But I \u2019 m leave it a be  for now  It \u2019 s a document of a time  I guess  One year on testosterone without physical change \u2013 This get a lot of traffic because it get a boost from Micah  I ask him if he \u2019 d share it on his social medium outlet  Thanks  Micah  A story about what it feel like to be bigender \u2013 I \u2019 m also really glad this get a lot of traffic because I work pretty hard on it  and I think it \u2019 s really illuminate and informative  I don \u2019 t identify a bigender  but a lot of people be curious about what it mean to be bigenderTwo post that I \u2019 m consider deleting  because they pop up in people \u2019 s search too much and be probably offtopic  Ruling with elf wisdom \u2013 People want to know what it mean to \u201c rule with elf wisdom  \u201d and this post isn \u2019 t go to tell them anything about that  It \u2019 s actually about a name I be consider go by  which mean \u201c rule with elf wisdom \u201d But then I nix that name  So it \u2019 s not even relevant any longer\u2026 Office work and transYA fiction \u2013 People search for \u201c office work \u201d pretty frequently  but I \u2019 m not sure why  And this be barely about that \u2013 it \u2019 s about how I volunteer in the office at my local gay alliance for a while  but it \u2019 s more about some YA book I be read while sit there  bore  in the officeOther than that  most of my search result have seem relevant  which be good  A lot of question about take testosterone while on other psychotropic drug  about be trans and use the bathroom  about different term under the \u201c genderqueer \u201d umbrella\u2026 It seem that just a many search be about janitor a they be about be trans  I guess I feel kind of weird about that because even though be a janitor be a big part of my identity and a semibig part of this blog  I don \u2019 t feel like I \u2019 m representational of janitor in general  for when people be search for info about janitors\u2026 Oh wellHere be some of the more bizarre search term that have lead people to my blog  \u201c commercial work schedule disorder \u201d \u2013 I once write about shiftwork disorder  so that \u2019 s probably where they land  \u201c literotica drag king \u201d \u2013 I like that word  I \u2019 m go to start use it  \u201c MTF tree house transgender \u201d \u2013 Once my spouse and I stay in a tree house while on vacation  And I mention that  Haha  \u201c image of scrap book to be make for bf \u201d \u2013 Not sure  I \u2019 ve never mention a scrap book or a boyfriend  \u201c be janitor off on snow day at school \u201d \u2013 YES THEY ARE  PAID DAY OFF  \u201c why would another male janitor pee all over your bathroom \u201d \u2013 Damn  I do not know dude  \u201c queer mullet \u201d \u2013 I be queer and I do have a mullet  More information about this can be find here  QueerTrans visiblity   flannel  mullet  For the future  I would like to continue to take academic paper and study  and distill them into something that be relateable  That \u2019 s probably my favorite thing to work on  If anyone know of any  let me know  I \u2019 ll continue to document my life too  of courseStay tuned\u2026 ", "feedtitle": "Page 7 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
