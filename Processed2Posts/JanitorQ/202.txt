testosterone  During this past year of see him multiple time  in the beginning  it be so many time   our value and expectation be not at all line up  My goal and value include communication  followthrough  trust  and respect  As far a I could gather  his value involve maximize appointment frequency         minimize facetime  be the expert  and use aggression to barrel through mistakesBecause of all these clash  I get myself a new doctor for a couple of month from now  Plus  I have a plan B if that doesn \u2019 t pan out  I feel a huge amount of relief to never have to see my previous doctor again  Here be an anecdote from that last visit  I call on a Friday to ask if I could come in and pick up a prescription the following week   Because testosterone be a controlled substance  I can never get refill or prescription fax to pharmacy  apparently  So even though I only need to see the doctor  get blood work every 6 month  I have to go every 3 month just to get a new script   The receptionist ask when I \u2019 d want to make the appointment  and I have to repeatedly be clear this be not an appt  I be not due for an appointment at this time  I tell her I \u2019 d like to come in Thursday to just pick up a prescription  I ask  \u201c Should I call ahead that morning to make sure  \u201d \u201c Yes  that would be good \u201d I call Thursday morning to ask if the script be ready  She reply that oh  no it \u2019 s still in his message box  She tell me he \u2019 d do it once I arrive at the office  I say OK Once I get there  I wait a while to speak with the receptionist  She and a patient be in the middle of an argument about outstanding billsThe woman ask how have she be able to see the doctor without pay  There have never be a time he have see her unless she pay first  This be why she \u2019 s not able to see him right now \u2013 she hasn \u2019 t pay first  So how could she have a debt if he win \u2019 t ever see her before she pay  She ask the receptionist to ask him  since she can \u2019 t go ask because he win \u2019 t talk to her unless she \u2019 s pay  at any point in time  She can never talk to him  There be a question about the date of these allege appointment  and the receptionist just keep reply that she do not know anything because she \u2019 s not the billing department  This circular backandforth be make me feel dizzy  I be root for her in this standoff  anyway   There be other nonsensical detail  but I can \u2019 t recall everything  I be focus on myself and get out as quickly a possibleThe woman step aside to call the billing department  so I approach the receptionist just to be like  \u201c Hey  remember me  I \u2019 m here now \u201d Haha  I sit back down and wait for a while  The doctor brush past the entrance to the wait room and mumble my name  maybe   and for me to step into room 4  My heart start race  I know I be about to be bully into an appointment  and I be prepping to fight backI stand up and tentatively walk toward the corridor  because I wasn \u2019 t even sure he have be address me   He come back through and direct me to a room  I say  \u201c OK  just to be clear  this be not an appointment  I be just here for the prescription \u201d \u201c I know  but we have to get you a new blood work form  so it be  an appointment   \u201d He essentially yell this a he rush down the hall to his office  I stand in the room to wait for him  but do not sit down or take off my coat  Once he come in  I assert  \u201c I have my blood work do in December  So it be not due  and I do not need an appointment at this time \u201d He reply  \u201c Oh  it be December  I think it be June  OK then  you \u2019 re right  Well  take this form anyway since I already fill it out  What prescription do you need  \u201d \u201c Androgel \u201d \u201c The Androgel rep be here right now  Go ahead and go back to the wait room and tell him how much you like it \u201d \u201c OK \u201d    I go back out to wait for him to get me my prescription  A young man in a suit and black wool pea coat  with a briefcase  sit kiddiecorner to me  I think to myself  Oh  what the hell  I like his product 100X more than I \u2019 ve like anything else I \u2019 ve ever be prescribe  I guess I \u2019 ll tell him\u2026 \u201c Hey  I like your product  \u201d I say  nod my chin his way  \u201c Oh  you like it  Great  It \u2019 s a good product \u201d I sit there feel smug and tough  for some reason  I guess because everything be feel increasingly surreal  and instead of shuttingdown to it  I participate in the absurdityThe doctor finally come out and give me my prescription  He say  \u201c Did you tell him how much you like it  \u201d \u201c I did \u201d And then I finally get to walk out the door  ",
