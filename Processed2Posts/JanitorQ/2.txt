should go about cleaning bathroom  And for the first time  it apply to all cleaner in all bathroom  not just guy cleaner go in woman \u2019 s girl \u2019 s bathroom  or gal go in the men \u2019 s  boy \u2019 s  The timing of it be not lose on me1  First  call out to see if anyone be in there  If they be  wait  2  Next  take a sign that be now velcroed to the back of all bathroom door  and velcroadhere it to the front  This sign read  \u201c Do Not Enter  Cleaning in Progress \u201d 3  Close the door  and then do whatever you \u2019 re do  whether it \u2019 s just load more paper towel or fullon clean the bathroomBefore this  we only have to be conscious if we be in bathroom that be opposite to the one of our gendersexWhen I come out to the principal and assistant principal  one of the first and only question they ask be about bathroom  Which bathrooms do I plan on use  If she  the principal  could make a suggestion  it would be best if I only use the gender neutral bathroom  I be polite in response  even though I have not think this through  and at the time  I use both the woman \u2019 s bathroom and the gender neutral bathroom  All I say be  \u201c A lot of people be worried about bathroom when it come to transpeople \u201d As it be  a year later  I really only do use the genderneutral bathroom because different people within the school have different perception about where I \u2019 m at  and I want to protect myself and also foster the idea that I be neither male nor female  I didn \u2019 t plan on this  I think I \u2019 d be continue to use both woman \u2019 s and genderneutral one  But I \u2019 m notI clean one set of bathroom in the \u201c centrum  \u201d an open plan area where the first grader be taught \u2013 there be 3 regular classroom  2 resource classroom  a big open area  and two bathroom  These bathroom don \u2019 t have door on them  and also therefore  there be no  \u201c Do Not Enter  Cleaning in Progress \u201d sign accompany them  Since I do get a head start while the first grader be get ready to go home  I always yell  \u201c Anyone in here  \u201d even before just dump the trash  clean the sink   Due to placement  there \u2019 s no way I \u2019 d encounter someone use the restroom from the sink area   A few day ago  I be do my routine and call out like always  No one answer  I be put in a new roll of paper towel  Then I hear a toilet flush  Also a bunch of kid be to the immediate right of this bathroom  put on their winter coat and boot  I finish load the paper towel  decide that it would have be a big deal if I have just leave it half load in my paranoia to escape the bathroom  The girl wash her hand and then I rip off a piece for her to dry her handsKids who be right there have a very lively conversation  \u201c There be no boy allow in the girl \u2019 s room \u201d \u201c And also no girl allow in the boy \u2019 s room \u201d \u201c But why be he in there in the bathroom then  \u201d \u201c He have to be in there because that \u2019 s his job \u201d \u201c He \u2019 s put more paper towel in there \u201d \u201c But still be you sure he can be in there  \u201d I just clear out without further fanfare  but I felt kinda fluster  Personally  I still feel like I half belong in the girl \u2019 s  woman \u2019 s bathroom  Indeed  those be the one I use the vast majority of the time when I be out in publicI be intrigue that these first grader gather that I be male  I honestly have no clue whether kid at the school I work at think I \u2019 m male or female  Whenever I \u2019 m ask  this happen so rarely   I do make a point to say  \u201c I \u2019 m neither  I \u2019 m a little bit of both \u201d But short of that  I don \u2019 t have a clue what conclusions they come to  One other thing that be tangentially related  I feel  because it concern personal space  Since I \u2019 ve come out  have top surgery  and be on testosterone for long enough that my physique and how I carry myself have change  I get touch a lot more at work  Some teacher pat or gently tap my shoulder and back  A few day ago  I be throw way off when a kid pat my midsection for no apparent reason  It \u2019 s definitely different  and I don \u2019 t respond likewise with anyone  but I get ta say that I do think it \u2019 s a positive change \u2013 I think people can tell that I be more comfortable in my skin  and some of them act accordinglyI \u2019 ll take it  If you \u2019 d like to see what I originally write about this topic  back in January of 2014  here it be  Bathroom anxiety  a genderqueer janitor \u2019 s perspective I decide to write a Part 2 because this one felt outdated  And I still haven \u2019 t cover everything  not by a lot shot   probably part 3 will appear in the future\u2026
