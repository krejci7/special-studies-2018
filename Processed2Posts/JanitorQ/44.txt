Became MixterFor the sake of clarity  I \u2019 m go to give myself a pseudonym deadname  for this article  Assume that before change my name  my name be \u201c KD Shorts \u201d And my new  legal name be \u201c Kameron \u201d A little over two year ago  I be at a workshop at the Philadelphia TransHealth Conference  and one of the presenter be mention that they go by the honorific  Mx   Mixter  in their professional setting  I have hear of this before  but I think it be just a theoretical pipe dream  Here be someone who be actually use it  in their actual life  I felt soooo jealous  I think to myself  with a good dose of bite envy   \u201c Oooh  look at the progressive academic who get to waltz around in an enlightened and indulgent bubble all day long \u201d I never think I would get there  Furthermore  even though I \u2019 m in my thirty  it be tough to envision a world where I be grownup enough to have an honorific of my ownI \u2019 d do an excellent job at avoid it  No Mr or Ms for me  I be a janitor at an elementary school  a place where there \u2019 s a lot of \u201c Mr   Mrs  Miss  Ms  last name  \u201d around the kid  and then first name amongst ourselves  Except for the custodial staff  It \u2019 s first names all around for u  generally  Everywhere except for our name plat on the custodial office door  There  we be \u201c Mr   last name  \u201d and \u201c Mrs   last name  \u201d I have somehow get away with request that I be simply \u201c KD Shorts \u201d It be awesomeThere be another sticking point though  every year  at school picture time  We get our pic take  and then we get some freebie  as well a a sheet of all the staff pic \u2013 just like a student would get a sheet of their class  And so  we have to give our name  to be record on the sheet  It would vary from year to year  depend on how vocalempowered I be feel  I usually tell the portrait employee  \u201c no Ms or Mr Just KD Shorts \u201d There be a few year though  where I be \u201c Ms  Shorts \u201d a the defaultThese past few week  I \u2019 ve be rid the wave of legally change my name  which have be especially gratify at work  where I be still know a KD Shorts   sheherhers   Everywhere else in my life  I have be go by \u201c Kameron \u201d for about two year  and  hehimhis  for many many year prior to that  So  essentially  I utilize this time of change a a chance to come out at workI talk to the principal and assistant principal on Friday  December 23rd  I state that I be change my name and my pronoun  and that I identify a neither a man nor a woman  The impromptu meeting be less than stellar \u2013 they fixate on bathroom and the fact that the change be go to be hard for people to remember  They do mention that they want me to feel comfortable  but didn \u2019 t offer any concrete way that that could happen  I do not panic though \u2013 I be think  \u201c do not catastrophize this \u201d I remain neutral and open  but I didn \u2019 t use it a a teaching moment  I shouldn \u2019 t have to  I think that thing would work out fine  ultimately  and if not  I could always call in the big gun  my local gay alliance \u2019 s speaker \u2019 s bureau  to do the educating on my behalfWe all take a time out for winter recess  I then come in on Tuesday  January 3rd  and the principal ask me if I \u2019 d come speak to her  Of her own volition  she have consult the head of HR  and she have basically do a 180  We have a much more fruitful discussion  She still be strong in her opinion  but she make it clear that every choice be up to me  and I could take some time to think it over  We end up talk about  \u2013 How to come out  and the timeline \u2013 How my name would appear on my name plate on the custodial office door \u2013 BathroomsComing out  I say that I have already pretty much tell the people I would naturally tell in person  the one I see regularly or semiregularly  And I wasn \u2019 t go to be able to get to everyone  so if she could either make an announcement at the next staff meeting andor send an email  that \u2019 d be great  We agree she would do both  I tell her I \u2019 d get back to her with the content I \u2019 d like her to sayName plate  The biggie  I say I have two idea  but I didn \u2019 t say exactly what they be   I \u2019 ll say it here though  Either 1 just \u201c Kameron \u201d and nothing else  2  Mx   last name    She say that her thought be that my coworker have Mr  and Mrs   so it \u2019 d be great if I conform to that and pick one or the other  I say  \u201c OK  Great  there be another option that I will go with  It \u2019 s Mx  That \u2019 s pronounced \u2018 Mixter   \u201d She write it down in her note  It be a do deal  Bathrooms  I could write an additional article about this  heck  probably more like a dissertation    but to keep it short and sweet  We agree that I get to pick where I go  and I be make no big deal of it  and it do not need to be a part of any announcementAll \u2019 s how it should be  Just one more small way I be join the world of adult  That \u2019 s Mixter  to you  ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
