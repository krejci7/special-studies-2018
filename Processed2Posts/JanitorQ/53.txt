I \u2019 ve think onandoff about it for a while  and I think the idea solidify over the summer  like  once I \u2019 m back to normal after recover from surgery  I \u2019 m go to look into it  Unfortunately I know I couldn \u2019 t just get this from my Primary Care Physician \u2013 she have be OK with maintain my androgel dosage  but not comfortable with change  increase anythingOn September 26  I call the local LGBTQ health clinic and explain what I \u2019 m look for  They say they could get me in on January 25th  I say  OK set the appointment  but in my head  I be think  this be a ridiculous amount of time to wait   And  I know  I know  relatively speak  it \u2019 s not at all  especially look at it from a global perspective  But  if I think I can do good than that  why not try   From there  I look up endocrinologist in my area and what type of care they cover  I find one that hypothetically seem like a good fit  and I post about it on the local transmen Facebook page  I get one comment that yeah  she and her staff be good  and a few more comment agree with the inefficiency of the clinic  In term of vetting  that seem good enoughI call her office on September 27th and be tell I \u2019 ll need a referral from my Primary Care Physician  and then once that \u2019 s in  I should hear back within a week  I call my PCP \u2019 s office  and they say they \u2019 d send that over right away  I then wait 10 day before call  I be tell the referral didn \u2019 t get receive  huh  not sure  can you have them send it again  Got that do  this time with a confirmation plus I get a copy  and wait another few day  I get a call from my PCP \u2019 s office  say that the endo need an additional referral  from a psychiatrist  GATEKEEPING at it fine  I would have be super piss  and probably would have stop try to go this route  if it weren \u2019 t for the fact that I actually do have a psychiatrist right now  So although I hate that I have to do it  it wasn \u2019 t actually much of a hassleI email my psychiatrist  she be already aware that I be pursue this   summarize the nature of the referral from my PCP  and ask her to also write a letter  I say that include pertinent information  like the fact that I \u2019 ve be on a low dose before  that I \u2019 ve have top surgery  andor that I identify a nonbinary would be great  She reply that she could write the date she \u2019 s see my  my diagnosis  mean my mental health diagnosis   medication she prescribe  and mental stability status  \u201c OK  \u201d I reply  \u201c OK that \u2019 d be great  thanks \u201d Guess I didn \u2019 t want to argue or push itI then wait another 8 day  by this point  it be Oct 25th  a whole month later and I still hadn \u2019 t secure an appt   and call the endo \u2019 s office again  I be give a wishywashy answer by the administrative assistant  That the endo be still in the process of find more information  and she be currently book out till January \u2013 they can get me in for January 10th  But at the same time  she can put me on a wait list to get me in sooner  I ask  if I be to call and check my status  would that help me \u201c jump the line \u201d   I didn \u2019 t actually use this phrase   She imply that sure  that could helpAt this point  I take a step back and think about what \u2019 s happen  So far  the endo get a referral from my PCP  and that didn \u2019 t include any history of care  just Female to Male transgender person  F641   chronic  In addition  they get information from a psychiatrist that I be bipolar  that I have be see her for 9 month  and that I \u2019 ve be stable during that time  relatively  this be such a short amount of time  it \u2019 s kind of imply that the rest of my \u201c bipolar disorder \u201d time be a wildcard   I don \u2019 t want to get too paranoid  but this collection of information be not work for me at all  That plus the fact that it \u2019 s straight up inaccurateFeeling like the system be work against me  I decide to pull from my bag of trick and email my therapist  If there \u2019 s anything that could help this stalemate  it \u2019 d be her  I relay this whole series of event and ask her if she could also write a referral  actually fill in the background information  She reply in 10 MINUTES \u2013 such a refreshing change  and say crazy that this be so hard  and sure she \u2019 d write a letter  and be there anything else I \u2019 d want to make sure she include  So she \u2019 s write a letter  My intent be  essentially  that this be not a new diagnosis  come out of nowhere  That I \u2019 ve already be on T in the past  I \u2019 ve have top surgery  I \u2019 m in the process of legally change my name  etc  So  this should be a continuation of ongoing care  timely  please    I \u2019 m not start from square one here  I imagine this endo have access of my medical record    not sure how that work   so if she look into it  she \u2019 d find this stuff  I \u2019 m just have my therapist bring it to the forefront  which will hopefully change something  Because  I feel like if it go the other way \u2013 my doctor send the referral first on my behalf  instead of me go backwards to get this stuff cover  I would have be give an appointment within a more reasonable window  Not sure if that \u2019 d be true or not \u2013 there could be dozen of reason outside of my control \u2013 maybe she \u2019 s just really busy  But  I get ta try\u2026Blah  ", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
