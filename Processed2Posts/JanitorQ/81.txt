principal and my supervisor  Then I would talk to the principal about my plan for come out to everyone else  and make sure that it be fine by her  This plan entail write an email to the school request male pronoun and a name change  And maybe a brief explanation about how I feel about my gender  Then I would try to be alert and correct people in the moment so that the adjustment period would move along quicker  Maybe I \u2019 d actually feel close to certain people during this process  Currently  I be far away from almost everyonePaths often diverge into other direction  or gradually end or loop back around  I make it through quite a few of these step  and each time  I felt an urgency to move ahead  and relief and pride for disclose more about myself  A little over a year ago  I come out to the principal of my school  workplace  Then  about 5 month ago  I cam out to the head of the kitchenFour month ago  I come out to my coworkerMost recently  about 3 month ago  I come out to my supervisorI think my supervisor be the major road block  That once that be take care of  the rest would happen quickly and effortlessly  Because it seem to be what I have be want for year  I want to tell all these people  I think  so that I could move on to the next stage  But now I \u2019 m start to think differently  I \u2019 m wonder if maybe I want to tell these people because I actually want them to know this thing about me  and not just a a mean to get to the next thing  Because as soon a the euphoria of tell my supervisor wear off  the urge to move forward surprisingly die down  Currently I feel no desire to follow the next step  s  in my planI could speculate a to why that be  The rest of the plan be too scary  so I \u2019 m trick myself into believe I don \u2019 t really want it  This seem unlikely because email the rest of the school and then reply in the moment seem totally doable if that \u2019 s what I want  Doing that stuff be so much more handsoff  and low key  a compare to come out to someone facetoface  especially if you don \u2019 t know how they \u2019 ll reactAnother guess  I \u2019 m worry that people win \u2019 t understand  I haven \u2019 t legally change my name yet  and I do not plan on change my gender marker on legal document  I also don \u2019 t plan on use the men \u2019 s room   Luckily there be 3 \u201c staff \u201d restroom within the school   Will people be confuse by my \u201c partial \u201d or \u201c selective \u201d transition  I \u2019 ve talk a lot about this in therapy over time  and I keep get assure that people will take what I say at face value  and I don \u2019 t need to overexplain  I always think about use a quip about bathroom in my mass email  \u201c Although I use the woman \u2019 s restroom  don \u2019 t worry \u2013 I will continue to clean them all \u201d Or something like that  If people don \u2019 t understand that I be not transition into manhood  then so be it  right  Another guess  Maybe I \u2019 ve actually reach the balance I \u2019 m look for  Maybe I don \u2019 t actually want to be call by my new name  and male pronoun in all area of my life because my gender be not that binary \u2013 maybe I actually need a little bit of both  This seem possible\u2026 I guess that time will tellOr  I be focus on my upcoming top surgery right now  that other genderrelated issue be on the back burner  This might be the case  Again  time will tellAbove all  when follow any transition path  whether it \u2019 s lay out in story in mass medium  or the WPATHSOC  or a therapist  or within each of u  it \u2019 s essential to listen to that heartgut combination voice  Not the voice inside your head  Not the voice of peer transition  Not the voice of medical professionalsSometimes it \u2019 s like there be one roadblock in otherwise wideopen terrainother time it \u2019 s like find yourself suddenly where you \u2019 ve never beensometimes it \u2019 s come across something completely unexpectedThat voice that say  \u201c this feel right  \u201d or \u201c this do not feel right  \u201d or \u201c I \u2019 m not sure about this yet so I \u2019 m go to slow down andor try a different path for a while \u201d This voice always have a simple message  and it \u2019 s always there  even if it seem bury by other  less important voice  Sometimes it \u2019 s a complex process to try and figure out what you want to do with that voice \u2019 s message  but the message itself be always simple and straightforwardMy voice unexpectedly tell me that it \u2019 s not time to come out to everyone at work right now  if ever  At a time when I be sure my voice be go to say  \u201c full speed ahead  You \u2019 re almost there  \u201d it actually do a 180  And  although a part of me want to just complete a task that have be on my mind for year  it be much more satisfying to listen to this voice than to check off one more thing on my transition todo listSpeaking of todo list  here \u2019 s one version of my transition todo list  from almost 2 year ago  Gender identity relate \u201c todo list \u201d There have be many  many version of this  with lot of revision  That \u2019 s part of what it mean to be on a path\u2026 ", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
