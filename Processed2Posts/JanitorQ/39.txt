 spoiler alert for this super obscure film that be probably hard to find  but totally worth it  My spouse and I just saw The Lure  a Polish film reenvisioning The Little Mermaid  mean Hans Christian Andersen much more so than Disney  although there be element from both   It take place in the 1980s  and these particular mermaid sister be vampiric vamp who come ashore in order to perform a singersdancersstrippers  One of them also join Triton \u2019 s punk rock band  There be no sea witch in this version  instead  they be exploit by the human around them  for their talent  The director liken them to \u201c immigrant  abuse by the local  use in the sex industry  on their way to their real goal\u2014America \u201d I didn \u2019 t quite catch that hidden meaning  although that \u2019 s super interesting  I guess I be look at it through a transspecific lens  and I saw a bunch of parallel that resonatedThe two sister have two very different focusesgoals  \u201c Golden \u201d want to perform and find her way to America  \u201c Silver \u201d fall instantly in love with the young bass player at the nightclub  Golden  very early on  warn her sister  something along the line of  \u201c would you be willing to eat him if need be  \u201d While on land with leg  the mermaid have no sexual or excretory organ  They \u2019 re parade around  and it \u2019 s say that they \u2019 re \u201c as smooth a Barbies \u201d When water be splash on them  Think  80 movie  Splash    and their tail reemerge  they do have a \u201c vagina \u201d of sort \u2013 it \u2019 s just super unconventional  Also  they have a strong fishy smell  d \u2019 uh    and another quote from the director  \u201c they represent innocence  yet their odour and slime recall girl mature  they menstruate  they ovulate  their body start smell and feel different \u201d The reason I \u2019 m focusing in on this in particular be because it be Silver \u2019 s motivation for what she do throughout the rest of the story  She do want to marry the bassist  but even more clearly  she want them to have sex  and he win \u2019 t  the way that she be  There be a really graphic surgery scene where she lose her tail and get new  permanent leg  fully form with vagina and everything else  She give up her singing voice  a a trade off  There then be a sex scene  which do not go a plan  And then  OK I \u2019 m go to leave it at that  to not give away anything more  I relate to this sexual conundrum  a a transperson  Not literally  of course  but  in a way  Just to cover the baseline  in general  transpeople feel all sort of way about sex and sexuality and their own anatomy  It really be all over the map  from person to person  And  as well  I \u2019 m sure  there be cispeople who feel a total disconnect  for a variety of reason  So it \u2019 s not really a \u201c transspecific issue  \u201d but  overall  it be surely more common among transpeople  Following that disclaimer  I \u2019 m actually only speak about my personal experience in the next couple sentence  I do not relate to what I have  And I never do  I \u2019 ve create some workarounds  in my head  over time  that have help  And I \u2019 ve be able to become more present  which be nice  But I still get hungup  And upset that there \u2019 s not a whole lot I can do about itI \u2019 m not the only one  by far  who be make this connection between transpeople and mermaid  If you be familiar with Jazz Jennings  16 year old transactivist  author  spokesmodel  youtube celeb  etc  she have link the two in some very strong way  She even have a company call Purple Rainbow Tails  through which she sell mermaid tail she \u2019 s make herself raise money for transkids  I find a really interesting article that touch on Jazz and mermaid call  Transgender Mermaids  Here \u2019 s a quote from it  Of course  the question that most people ask be \u201c Why mermaid \u2014 why not some other animal or creature  \u201d The reason may be vary and complex  and they may vary with each girl  However  a common theme be that mermaid may hold a special appeal because they have a high level of human feminine facial feature and upper body feature while have a low body that isn \u2019 t that of a traditional human female  Many transgender girl may relate to this because they know that they be truly female no matter what their genitalia may beAlso  Mermaids UK be a support resource and advocacy group that have be around since 1995      focus on help transgender kid and adolescent  and their familiesI be once in a really obscure play  a reworking and twisting of the child \u2019 s play  If Boys Wore the Skirts  The original be \u201c a satire on what may happen if woman continue to copy the clothes that men wear  According to this play  in selfdefense the men may take to wear feminine thing  Here we see a bunch of rugged male force into skirt  The setting be a schoolroom in the present \u201d  Present  meaning 1958   The version that I be in be a mature audience  trippedout dreamlike version  As one of the \u201c schoolboy  \u201d I get to imagine and create my own genitalthemed skirt  call a \u201c groinment \u201d I have such a blast with this  probably much more than anyone around me could have know  I \u2019 ll leave you with two image of what I come up with  I pull out the ol \u2019 skirt and waterballoons this weekend  to get a photo of this creation  When I look back at the picture from the actual show  however  I realize I \u2019 d do a different water balloon configuration  haha  Either way works\u2026This be from the fashion show scene  I \u2019 m gon na spell out what I get go on here  There \u2019 s a highly delicate water balloon configuration at the top of the water slide  These pointy party hat be there to protect it  And in my right hand be a needle  I \u2019 m the only one who get to \u201c pop \u201d it   And I do  and the water actually do follow along the slide
