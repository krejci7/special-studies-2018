this blogging milestone  It \u2019 s be 3 year and 6 month now  Which be 42 month  mean I \u2019 ve average close to 5 post per month  And that \u2019 s be fairly consistent  I haven \u2019 t have time of be prolific follow by time of not write anything and backandforth  Same with wordcount \u2013 post have be no more than 1000 word  no less than 600 wordsAlthough it \u2019 s be moderate and steady  the way I feel about the writing and the blog change fairly drastically and frequently  Sometimes I feel like I \u2019 m an objective observer  record down what have transpire  Other time  I have put so much of myself into what I write  that the process  and the feedback I get have help boost me up through some really difficult time  So  thank you  for all that feedback  Sometimes I \u2019 ve felt like there isn \u2019 t much point to continue  I have nothing to say  Other time  I feel super good about this ongoing personal account of experience that be valuable for others  and myself  to look into  look back onI \u2019 d say  currently  it \u2019 s mostly the first thing  I \u2019 m an objective observer  write down what be happen and feel kind of distance from it  And that \u2019 s OK \u2013 it \u2019 s not go to always feel this way  I have learnedSo  in that vein  here \u2019 s that account I say I would write  of my first month be out  at work  A quick recap \u2013 I have talk to my supervisor  coworker  4 teacher  the principal  and the assistant principal  I have also get thing move in the HR department  and we be just go into Xmas recess  During that week when kid and teacher be out  I though it \u2019 d be a great time for my coworker to start  while it be just u  I write  \u201d I have a feeling my coworker  ally will step up and lead it  follow by me correct everyone every single time \u201d The first day  my supervisor call me through the walkie talkie  \u201c  old name   can you get a 20\u2033 red pad  \u201d Me  \u201c It \u2019 s go to be Kameron now \u201d Long pause  Her  \u201c Kameron  can you get the 20\u2033 red pad  \u201d Then when she saw me  she say  \u201c You \u2019 re go to make me practice now  \u201d \u201c Yeah  \u201d And we be off  With  a I hop  my coworker leading  But the thing be  I didn \u2019 t actually have to correct anyoneWhen break be over and everyone be back  I tell 8 more people in person  and also have a 2nd  much more productive  conversation with the principal  More detail be in the post  How I become \u201c Mixter \u201d  We talk about how to come out and the timeline  how my name would appear on my name plate on the custodial office door  and bathroom  She tell me I could think about these thing and get back to her tomorrow  That all sound fine  but a I go about my cleaning routine that night  I think about how tough it be to just catch her  and what if it \u2019 s a while before I be able to get back to her  Plus the monthly faculty meeting be the following morning     And even though I don \u2019 t attend these  that \u2019 s a great place for school announcement   So  I leave a note on her table that night  so that action could start roll ASAP  The note read1316 Hey  Principal   Here \u2019 s what I \u201d m thinking  Fac Meeting \u2013 a head up about a forthcoming email Email \u2013 That I \u2019 m change my name and that I \u2019 m now use male pronoun  hehimhis  Sign on Custodial Door \u2013 Mx   last name   pronounced Mixter   I \u2019 m comfortable answer any question about thisalso a recommendation if you one day have a transgender student  A podcast call \u201c How to be a Girl  \u201d tell from the pointofview of a parent \u2013 with lot of input from her 8yearold daughter  male to female   They talk about school  friend  privacy  etc  The parent be a great advocateThank you  KameronThere be some slight confusion in which the principal include all this information in the schoolwide email  where  for example  I have only intend the podcast recommendation to be for her  But  I realize  the fact everyone receive all of the above be actually way well  It give people more context  which  I really really really think help the information lodge into their brain well  Like  I have not have to correct anyone  once  Which be just completely blow my mind  People seem more into address me by my name than before  Some people have decide to call me \u201c Kam  \u201d instead  of their own volition  which I \u2019 m OK with \u2013 it \u2019 s just plain fascinating   My one coworker  ally have be call me  \u201c Killa Kam \u201d for a while now  Haha   A barrier between me and other people have definitely start to lift  just within this past month  I have have more conversation with more people about a wide variety of thing than ever before  This be what be a person within a work environment be mostly about  The connection be what make it something more than just a random assortment of people that you  seemingly  have nothing in common withI wan na just keep run with this  PS  This post have 882 word  Haha  PPS  Posts come soon about this amazing podcast  \u201c How to be a Girl  \u201d ", "feedtitle": "Page 5
