chance to kind of look back and take stock  And to see where I be at  here \u2019 s what I write last year  World mental health day  Nat \u2019 l come out day 2016Before talk about this year  I just want to note that last year I say  \u201c I \u2019 d say within the next 6 month I \u2019 ll be out at work and everywhere else  I look forward to the day that my driver \u2019 s license  signature  little plastic rectangle on the custodial office  Facebook page  the word out of teacher \u2019 and coworker \u2019 mouth  and everything else  all say the same thing  \u201d I \u2019 ve reach that point    Well  everything except that little plastic rectangle  but that be inprocess  see below   This past year in my mental health landscape  I think I be stable in a way that couldn \u2019 t be rock  but actually I end up back in the hospital again with another manic  psychotic episode  I know my loved one go through a lot of stress and strife  but  in comparison to past episode  this felt like a breeze  and it even felt heal in many way  I do want to try to write about this  but I \u2019 m not quite there yet  Hopefully soon  I spend two month out of work  I get raise to triple my prior dose of Seroquel  a drug I continue to like a lot \u2013 a first for me   and now I \u2019 m down to double my prior dose  I \u2019 m off of any antidepressant right now  I \u2019 m worry I will lapse into another depression  but so far  so good  I \u2019 m start to finally address the issue I \u2019 m have with oversleep  But  to be honest  if oversleeping be the bad thing to come out of be in a really good place mentally otherwise  then so be it  I guess\u2026 For now at leastIn term of National Coming Out Day  come out be happen all the time  and I \u2019 m glad to be in a place where I \u2019 m neither invisible nor fearful of have to come out again and again and again  I love every opportunity  Take yesterday for example  I didn \u2019 t realize it be National Coming Out Day until that night when I go on facebook after work  And during that day  I have two instance of come out  While I be work in the cafeteria during lunch  a kid ask me  \u201c Are you a boy  \u201d I reply  \u201c I \u2019 m neither  I \u2019 m a little bit of both \u201d He reply  \u201c Really   \u201d And I say  \u201c Yeah  \u201d I have a big smile on my face  Then later in the afternoon  I realize that my new bos    get his plastic rectangle with his name \u201c engrave \u201d and it be now on the custodial door  and I \u2019 ve be wait for mine since January  when I change my name  So instead of get work up about that  I just write down on a piece of paper what I want  so there \u2019 d be no confusion  and explain to the administrative assistant that Mr  last name  have his on the door and I \u2019 ve be wait for mine  She apologize for forget to include mine in the order  and say she would go ahead and order mine  I give her the paper  It say  \u201c Mx   last name   \u201d She verbalize that back to me to make sure it be right  and I say  \u201c Yep \u201d I should have that up hopefully within a couple of week  finally  This feel like such a victory  There \u2019 s one other thing I want to mention regard mental health  I start listen exclusively to a newtome podcast  By this  I mean  I listen to podcasts every day while at work  And previously  that would be somewhere between 58 different one at any give time  Right now  for whatever reason  I \u2019 m just listen to one  all day every day  I \u2019 m sure I \u2019 ll get tire of it and get back to some of my other one  but for now  it \u2019 s pretty mesmerize  If you \u2019 re interested in check it out  it \u2019 s call the Mental Illness Happy Hour  It be definitely not for the faint of heart  The host joke that he do not give advanced notice for trigger because he would have to stop every couple of minute to announce another Trigger Warning  And it be absolutely true  There be a lot of stuff about abuse of all kind  dark secret and shame  both sexual in nature and just like  the kind of stuff that randomly pop in your head and you hate yourself for think it  The host lighten thing up by be in turn uplift and darkly humorous  Each show be somewhere between 23 hour       and he \u2019 d read people \u2019 s survey they \u2019 ve sent in anonymously  and he will also interview one person per show  He \u2019 s do all this seemingly on his own  and he \u2019 s make a living off of it  I \u2019 m kinda obsess right now  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
