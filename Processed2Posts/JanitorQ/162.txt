"text": "Happy almost Halloween  I think I \u2019 d celebrate by dig deep into my write archive to see if I could find something festive  It may not be all that festive  but it do seem apt \u2013 I find something I write 12 year ago  on Halloween day  that touch on gender identity  costume  and anxietyA little back story for what be to follow  I be a Junior in college  and I be take an awesome class call Imagining Herself  a crossclass between Women \u2019 s Studies and English Literature  The book list be from some Gender Studies Dream Team  for 2002  at least   Leslie Feinberg \u2013 Stone Butch Blues Riki Anne Wilchins \u2013 Read My Lips Zora Neale Hurston \u2013 Dust Tracks on a Road Kate Bornstein \u2013 Gender Outlaw Audre Lorde \u2013 Zami  A New Spelling of My NameAnd others that I can \u2019 t remember anymore  Unfortunately  I didn \u2019 t read these book  well  I \u2019 d already read Stone Butch Blues on my own   I couldn \u2019 t  I be have some major depressive issue  which really put a damper on what I be capable of do  I hadn \u2019 t tell any professor I need help yet  but I would be do so in the very near future  The professor \u2019 s name be Katrina  not her real name   I sort of have a girlfriend at the time  whom I \u2019 ll refer to a \u201c girlfriend  \u201d Question mark  because I be never clear on whether we be actually together  Girlfriend  have be in this class the semester before me  so the professor have a clear memory of herHere \u2019 s what I write on Halloween  12 year ago   More than ever  I become terribly anxious in Imagining Herself today  I think because we be discuss Stone Butch Blues  and I felt like I be suppose to be add to the discussion  yet I couldn \u2019 t say anything  I \u2019 m one of five people in class who be potentially VERY focus on issue raise in that book  These other classmate all contribute a lot  I contribute nothing  I just couldn \u2019 t  Katrina even bring attention to me because of the zines I \u2019 ve be hand in for my project  She want me to talk about some of the stuff \u201c  Janitorqueer \u2019 s  be do these amazing zines  \u201d she tell the class  I felt like I be in elementary school again  simultaneously hop for and fear any kind of attention  \u201c Can you share with u your thought about what you \u2019 ve be write about  after read through Stone Butch Blues again  \u201d I hadn \u2019 t read through Stone Butch Blues again  I hadn \u2019 t yet read ANY of the book for class  I feel guilty and like a fraud  I star straight ahead  Said  \u201d \u2026 um \u2026 \u201d in almost a whisper  My mind be totally blank  Why do this happen  She acknowledge my discomfort by ask me if we should just move on  I say  \u201c yeah \u201d I think I might cry  How awful would that have be  I tune out completely to avoid that scene  and that work really well  I come back to reality within a few minute  But for the rest of class  all I want to do be grab all of my stuff and run out of the room \u2026 go and hide  I have this urge often in class  but it \u2019 s never be THIS intense  Sometimes I want to slip through the edge of the floor  but not today  I just want to explode out  to escapeGirlfriend  be bring up during the discussion  We be talk about clothing and performance  and Katrina ask me  \u201c You know  your girlfriend    right  \u201d I nod  Because I refer to girlfriend  a few time in my zines  she must have make the connection  Then she address the class  \u201c Girlfriend  use clothes a a performance all the time  She be always play \u2026 she \u2019 ll wear goth  hello kitty  Ragedy Ann  girlfriend  prefers to call this one \u201c Bag Lady \u201d  \u2026 and when she come into class the day people be instruct to wear particularly masculine or feminine clothing  something different than normal  she say that this isn \u2019 t any different for her than any other day because she \u2019 s always play  She feel comfortable dress extremely masculine andor feminine \u201d A classmate ask  \u201c Did she have pink hair for a while last year  \u201d and I nod  yes  \u201c Oh  ok  I have a class with her  She be really interesting \u201d Katrina  \u201c Yeah  she \u2019 s very bright \u201d Classmate  \u201c Political Science major  \u201d I nod againI don \u2019 t think I \u2019 ve ever think of girlfriend  \u2019 s incredible attention to clothing a \u201c playing \u201d I think of it a this valley girl thing she do  This thing which be sometimes tedious and sometimes fun and goofy   She be really excited about create me a a goth girl for Halloween   To look at it a a carefully plan out form of play make me respect it much more  I feel proud that I \u201c know \u201d her  I feel especially tender toward her  or something  ah  I don \u2019 t know  Anyway \u2026 \u201d I remember that Halloween  She dress me up in her clothing and do my hair and makeup  I like it  She be dress a a schoolgirl go wrong  or something to that effect  It be a really warm night  and we kind of just walk around a lot  stop in at this party and that party  maybe acquaintance of hers   I have no idea  As per usual  I be out of it  dissociate   It make me think about all the thing we can be express with our clothing choice  genderwise and otherwise  And although Halloween costume be extremes  all sort of outfit can be see a \u201c costumes \u201d Getting dress up in formal wear  Costume  Even business casual  Still  costume  Work out clothes  Total costume  If it \u2019 s not a tshirt  hoodie  buttonup shirt  mostly flannel   jean  corduroy  or gym short  sweat pant for lounge around   hike boot  or skater shoe  to me  it feel like a costume  Which isn \u2019 t a bad thing at all  Costumes have their time and place \u2013 I love costumes  But I will not compromise and wear clothing that do not allow me to feel like myself  when that \u2019 s all I wan na beAnother blog writer cover some similar concept  here \u2013 Becoming Hope  MasksOh  and completely coincidentally  this year I \u2019 m go a a goth boy for Halloween  What \u2019 s your take on costume  ", "feedtitle": "Page 17
