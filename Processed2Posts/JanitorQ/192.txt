doctor at a woman \u2019 s health group  unintentional   This have be an ongoing saga  and although it \u2019 s not a perfect fit  it \u2019 s good enough  at least for now  Looking for more backstory  Back in January  I decide I be feed up with my doctor  and that I could do good  By the end of February  I \u2019 d find a promising candidate  only to realize she \u2019 s part of a woman \u2019 s health group  My last appointment with my doctor  at the end of March  be an absurdist performance pieceIt have be challenge to find appropriate health care where I live  but I \u2019 ve plow ahead anyway because  1  I know what I be try to get  and 2  I don \u2019 t see any reason why I should not get it  This new doctor have no expertise in trans identity  and I know that go in  But I do find her through the local gay alliance \u2019 s resource page  so that be a start  When I tell her that this be how I come to be here  she reply  \u201c Well\u2026 yes  I be LGBT friendly  but I don \u2019 t know how I get on that list \u201d What do that mean    When I tell her the reason I \u2019 m here be to get more Androgel  she reply that she do not feel qualified to prescribe hormone  That be the start of the discussion  but by the end  she be give me a prescription for exactly what I say I \u2019 ve be on for over a year already  and she be change her tune to  \u201c I suppose I could for the time be  but the longterm health risk be too great  and it \u2019 s not my area of expertise \u201d I tell her I \u2019 ve be go to the one trans specific doctor in the area who treat adult  that I know about   and I want to switch because I do not like him  She use her laptop to confirm she know of no local doctor  aside from the clinic that treat adolescent and young adult  She suggest I could use her a my PCP and still go to my other doctor for the hormone  I tell her I be not go to do this  She then suggest she might be able to get me in at the adolescent clinic for a onetime visit  so that she can then be advise by them about my care  I tell her that would be amaze  She will be follow up with me on this  and I would be happy to goI tell her how I perceive my gender identity  why I \u2019 m take testosterone  and that it do not involve much health risk for me personally  She say  even so  she do not know enough about it  I ask her  \u201c What if a woman want to take testosterone to address issue with a low sexdrive  \u201d  Women do this   She say that she would not use testosterone a a treatment  It \u2019 s not be prove to be effective  She continue on to say that she do have some male patient  husband  son  etc  of patient  who want to come here   and some have low testosterone level  and she \u2019 s not the one to prescribe them testosterone  I find this difficult to believeI show her a copy of my late blood test  and this be when the table start to turn  I saw her open up  I illustrate what I know by tell her what \u201c normal \u201d female and male range be  and where I fall within that  I tell her that risk such a increased blood pressure  redblood cell count  cholesterol  etc  be real concern that can be monitor through blood work  but I believe I counteract those risk anyway with my lifestyle  vegetarian diet  active profession  don \u2019 t smoke  drink only moderately   I tell her  bluntly  \u201c It \u2019 s not that complicated \u201d And  in the end  she seem OK with it  She be ask me what diagnosis I would like her to put for insurance purpose  I tell her that Gender Identity Disorder be in the DSM \u2013 \u201c I don \u2019 t like it  but it \u2019 s there \u201d She respond with  \u201c What about \u2018 hormone treatment for transgender patient  \u2019 Well  you don \u2019 t identify a transgender\u2026 \u201d I tell her that I do  that \u201c transgender \u201d be an umbrella term  and that diagnosis work OKI go by this new name I \u2019 m try out  at the doctor \u2019 s office  I figure this be a compartmentalized atmosphere  and a good place to see what it feel like  I get ta say  it didn \u2019 t feel great  I \u2019 m not sure what that \u2019 s about yet  If that mean this just isn \u2019 t the name for me  or if I \u2019 d actually feel this way about any new name  because any and all would feel foreign at first  I \u2019 m sure my gut will tell me  And time  Time will tell me  I also tell her I \u2019 d like to go by male pronoun  She say  \u201c We can do our best with this  You \u2019 ll probably have to remind u  but we \u2019 ll try \u201d Her body language while she say this conveyed  \u201c I don \u2019 t get it  I \u2019 m not really go to try  but feel free to try to get u to try \u201d And this be where thing be  ", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
