be the last part of a 3part series explore some issue that be on the mind of a lot of nonbinary people  include myself  Part one be about pronoun  Part two be about bathroom  This post be about legal designation  fill out formsGreat time on this one  A few month ago  I sign an online petition request that the executive branch legally recognize gender outside of the malefemale binary and provide an option for these gender on all legal document and record  Just yesterday  I get a response from The White House  in my inbox  Er  I mean  you know  it \u2019 s a mass email  a form reply for all petition signer  but really  how cool be that when I be prepare to write about this topic anyway    Here be an excerpt  We know how important this issue be  and we understand the profound impact  both symbolic and otherwise  of have official document that accurately reflect an individual \u2019 s identity  These document play an essential  functional role  but also demonstrate the measure of dignity and respect afford to our nation \u2019 s citizen  We can not overstate the care and seriousness that should be bring to bear on the issueWe recognize the importance of gender identification in particular and the Obama Administration be work to modernize federal policy in this area  For example  in 2010  the US Department of State make it easy for individual to update the gender marker in their passport  And last year  the Social Security Administration follow suit by simplify the process for individual to change the gender marker on their social security card to reflect their identity accuratelyAs you can imagine  there be considerable variance across agency and level of government  And so while the Obama Administration want to make sure that official document reflect the identity of the Americans who hold them  we believe proposal to change when and how gender be list on official document should be consider on a casebycase basis by the affected federal and state agency  However  that consideration must be inform by best practice and a commitment to honor individuality and ensure fairnessSo  it sound like a polite  \u201c No \u201d If you want to read the entirety  it be here  We the People Petition on NonBinary Genders  In this world of constant feedback loop  you can also let the government know what you think of their response  share on Facebook and Twitter  etcPersonally  this be the thing I want the most  In my two previous post  I explain that although I identify strongly with be nonbinary  I actually be not strongly bother by gendered pronoun  I prefer male pronoun  or gendered bathroom  I use the woman \u2019 s bathroom   In general  I attempt to mix and match gendered option to optimize my comfort level  and that have usually work for me  But when it come to declare  \u201c I be male \u201d or \u201c I be female  \u201d I simply can not do it  Legally  I be female  simply because it be the default in this case  I would not seriously consider legally change my gender unless I can change it to a genderneutral option  and if I could  I would do it ASAP   Legal stuff feel like a more black and white  eitheror arena than bathroom  pronoun  and anything else in the real world which be comparatively flexible and fluid  What I mean by this be  for example  I like when people say  \u201d sir  \u201d \u201c man  \u201d and use male pronoun because they \u2019 re see me  we \u2019 re interacting  and that interaction have the potential of be nuanced  fluid  change  I could walk in the woman \u2019 s bathroom today  and tomorrow decide to go in the men \u2019 s  without too much consequence  hopefully  if I want or need toThe legality of be one gender or another seem so much more finite  setinstone  weighty  And I want another option      People in Australia  a of a few month ago  be able to pursue a \u201c nonspecific \u201d designation  I want to be able to as well   Although  I didn \u2019 t realize this until look into it just now  but Australian citizen pursue this must present medical proof of gender confirmation surgery  It would be important  ultimately  for medical transition status to not play any part in this designation \u2013 just my very very strong opinion   Until I have this option  I will continue to evade declare my gender as often a I can  I will continue to leave it blank on form whenever possible  and to explain the nuance if the opportunity arise  As of now  if my gender be not list on a form  my  very feminine  legal name will immediately give me away anyway  So although I have no plan to legally become male  I do plan to legally change my name to something ambiguous  And as soon a I start hear about small instance where a \u201c nonspecific  \u201d \u201c nonbinary  \u201d \u201c X  \u201d or whatever the term may be  be a possible option  I will start pursue it  Even if that mean I \u2019 m list a \u201c F  \u201d on some thing and \u201c X \u201d or whatever on others  It \u2019 s go to start on a small scale  like doctor office form  maybe thing like library card application  etc   It \u2019 s already start  And just build and build from there  All the way up to driver \u2019 s license  passport  and birth certificate  One day  I hope\u2026 ", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
