 Or more accurately  girl \u2019 and boys \u2019 restroom \u2013 I clean toilet  and I work at an elementary school  There be also a few gender neutral bathroom  for staff  which be pretty great  For a tally  there be 3 girl \u2019 gang bathroom and 3 boy \u2019 gang  That \u2019 s really how they be refer to  which totally conjure image of ruffian scribble graffiti all over the wall and pull all the toilet paper off the roll  Oh  and smoking and fighting and stuff    3 gender neutral bathroom for staff  one woman \u2019 s room  one men \u2019 s room  and 7 bathroom within classroom  also gender neutral  For my first halfhour of work  kid be still in school  I like to get a head start on some area I can access before they leave for the day  and gang bathroom be one of the place I can start  But only if I \u2019 m sure no kid be in there  and they \u2019 re not likely to come in  Especially for the boy \u2019  because technically I be female  This be very seriousBefore I labor over that point  here \u2019 s a little back story about my take on which bathroom I personally should be in  Over the holiday  I get to hang out with two outoftown friend who be both trans  They be both describe dream they \u2019 ve have where they go into an unaccommodating bathroom  like stall be miss or it be more of an open lockerroom vibe  And they ask my partner and me if we \u2019 ve have public restroom anxiety  and we both reply  \u201c No \u201d And in that sense  it \u2019 s true  I strongly feel myself to be nonbinary and genderqueer  and my sense of self be closer to male than female   yet I really have no question or reservation about which public restroom to use  If a genderneutral or family one be available  I will use that  Otherwise  I will use the woman \u2019 s room  And if people be do a double take or wonder if I should be there  that \u2019 s kinda their problem  Because it \u2019 s the bathroom I feel more comfortable in  I didn \u2019 t always feel this way  I use to always feel very anxious about the whole endeavor of go into the woman \u2019 s room  Honestly  I \u2019 m not sure what change  other than the fact that I \u2019 d rather be in there than in the men \u2019 s room  and I \u2019 d rather feel calm than anxious  What if  though  I be just a few degree closer to feel male and present masculine  Andor I felt more comfortable go to the men \u2019 s room  but look the way I look now  What would that mean for me at work  The whole system of safety accord to separation of gender would be break down  Like  what if I be out at work  and ask for male pronoun and use the men \u2019 s  boy \u2019 s room  Would there be a lot of upheaval and confusion  Or would everyone be accept and cool with it  I really can \u2019 t make that call in advance  but it \u2019 s interest to think about  even on this basic level of which bathroom be it \u201c safe \u201d for me to be in at the same time with child  Daily  I have to be in and out of both bathroom  And a of now  f I get a call that there \u2019 s a problem in a boys \u2019 room  I get ta get out wet floor sign and yell into the doorway  \u201c Anyone in here  \u201d  I do this for the girl \u2019 room too  even though I don \u2019 t technically have to   If I \u2019 m already in there and a boy walk in  I have to make a huge deal out of the fact that we be both in there  And I have to walk out immediately  This happen just yesterday in fact  I know I be take a chance  start to clean the bathroom before school be out  A firstgrader come in  and I have to be all  \u201c Wait one second  Let me leave and then you can go in \u201d He be really fluster and turn right around and be really hesitant about go in at all after I walk out  I have to repeat a couple of time  \u201c You can go ahead now \u201d Why all the paranoia      I follow this protocol because people can loose their job over shit like this  And a part of me understand it  from a safety standpoint  But at the same time  we be instill and reinforce really irrational fear and gender rigidity into kid  The situation be anxiety provoking  all around  During the majority of my shift though  I walk in and out of bathroom without any hesitation because my coworker and I be the only one in the school   There be even activity most day  but everyone need to go to designate bathroom at those time  They can \u2019 t just wander around the school   This may sound kinda weird  but bathroom be a good place to kill some extra time  I like to practice pee stand up  without an STP device   Basically because I don \u2019 t have one  I \u2019 m think about get one   Interestingly  I do this still in the girl \u2019 room  I never actually use the boy \u2019 bathroom  it \u2019 s be ingrain in me too   Also  bathroom have mirror  which use to come in handy when I be just start to get into do drag  I \u2019 ve spent countless work hour listen to my mp3 player and practice lip synching and dancing  in front of mirror in the public restroom  I like to use the mop handle a a microphone stand  It \u2019 s pretty funBathrooms end up be a microcosm for people \u2019 s anxiety surround gender  And I don \u2019 t totally get it  But I can attest to the fact that it be indeed taught and reinforce at a very young age  I can also attest to some difference between gender  base on the different state I find the bathroom in or just trend and difference between the two  but that \u2019 s sort of a different topic all together  And some of it be just plain gross  ", "feedtitle": "Page 22 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
