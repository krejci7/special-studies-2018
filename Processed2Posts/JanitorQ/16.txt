the vast majority of my time there  I \u2019 ve always clean the downstairs  The water fountain be well  It be cooler in hot weather  There be more people to interact with  The room be clean  for the most part   I be closer to thing that I need to access  receiving room with supply  dumpster  the custodial officeAbout 2 year ago  I clean the upstairs for roughly 6 month  It be not my choice \u2013 thing be rough in a lot of different way  and this be just one more thing  One more really big thing though  in my head  I be in and out of work a few time  due to a serious depression  When I be up there  it felt a if I could barely do the task  and the fact that they be recur forever and ever be intolerable  I be rush myself  always feel like I didn \u2019 t have enough time to do everything  I be at a loss a to what to do about all the recycling  which for me be a \u201c must do \u201d I just felt like I do not belong up there  I be try to pop in and out of area before kid be out of school  and then backtracking  which felt totally inefficient but seem to be the only way to keep busy  Just be felt painful  And the fact that the be be on the second floor make the pain feel compound so tightly within itself that I be struggle beyond beliefBy about midOctober of 2015  I be tell I be switch back to the first floor  Apparently my coworker wasn \u2019 t do a great job  there be complaint  it be more important to be clean on the first floor than the second floor    Anyway  at that time  I be sooooooo relieve  It be a visceral feeling  All the negativity be leave up on the second floor  and although I be still struggle  I fit right back into the first floor  A few month later  I get on a medication that really start work for me  and the next two year go really well for the most partSometimes a little too well  As I \u2019 ve mention before  I go through a manic episode in May  and I be out for two month  recover from that  In a good way though \u2013 so far so good on the avoidance of a rebound depression  However  I lose my status at work  When I get back  it be clear that the new guy be now the new secondincommandIn the past  this would have felt devastating  and I would have cling onto whatever control I do have  to the detriment of myself  only  really  I know because I \u2019 d already put myself through all that  big time  This time around  I decide to take it all in stride  a best I could  Instead of argue about how I couldn \u2019 t do the second floor or anything like that  I spend time \u201c stake it out  \u201d I guess you could say  Just  spending time up there visualize this or that and get accustom to the idea  before kid come backNow that school be back in session  I be IN IT  And it \u2019 s not actually bad  So far it have felt preferable  in fact  I \u2019 ve make some change to my routine that really feel like they \u2019 re make a difference  Instead of bring my cart plus mop bucket plus garbage barrel to each and every classroom  I be \u201c sweeping through  \u201d first with the garbage and rag to wipe everything down  then with the vacuum for all the area rug  and then with the dust mop  I be take WAY more step go through multiple time instead of go roombyroom  but it \u2019 s feel good  Feeling faster  evenAnd the weather have not be too hot  And there \u2019 s a new drinking fountain up there a of a couple month ago \u2013 the kind where you can easily fill up a water bottle from  and it say how many plastic bottle you be save by do so  I love it  And I like the fact that the teacher clear out early up there  for the most part  And the room have be clean thusfarBest of all  I have my own \u201c room \u201d to store stuff  up there  That \u2019 s new  So while thing be kinda turbulent with coworker dynamic  I be so glad to have all my stuff and activity separate from theirs  moreso than ever beforeAll the negative association I \u2019 ve hold about the second floor have pretty much melt away  A lot of that have to do with mental health and come out at work  I don \u2019 t feel like I \u2019 m try so hard to get in and out of place  I actually feel like I belong  When I talk with people  I like my voice  When I walk and do all this physical work  more muscle mass be make it feel much more effortlessThe only thing I \u2019 m dreading now be \u201c gym use \u201d Coming soon will be scream child use the gym for their cheerleading practice  from 6830pm  And once that \u2019 s over  it \u2019 ll be basketball all winterlong  We \u2019 ll see how well I can adjust\u2026 ",
