\u2019 s only now hit large news outlet because there be now three statelevel civil right complaint  try to get her reinstated  I read about it in the newspaper while at work  yesterdayShe be treat transgender student who come to her with a previous diagnosis  She be definitely qualify to do so  have go through many hour of training in transhealth care  attend a conference sponsor by WPATH  World Professional Association for Transgender Health   etc  She be do this at the college \u2019 s expense  which just make it seem like it be condone by the college  right    WPATH \u2019 s stance be  \u201c With appropriate training  \u2026hormone therapy can be manage by a variety of provider  include nurse practitioner  physician assistant  and primary care physicians \u201d Apparently  this be outside the scope of what the Student Health Center do  but this be never communicate to her  The termination come from out of the blueHormones be prescribe for other reason at the health center  with no problem  Birth control  ovarian disease  and low testosterone be all treated regularlyInterestingly  the information on the Student Health Center \u2019 s website change two month after her firing  While it have say  \u201c comprehensive primary care  \u201d and \u201c continuity of care  \u201d it now say  \u201c basic primary care \u201d and have no mention of continuous care  At least they \u2019 re be accurate about the downgrade    This just anger me to no end because this doctor take it upon herself to step it up and become well verse in an area that  for whatever reason  make so many medical professional so squeamish and standoffish  And if this be something she do of her own volition  and it be well within the standard of care  then back it up  What be the university afraid of  There be standard in this field  despite the fact that the medical profession be grotesquely behind the curve with this  in general  A bunch of transgender student be leave in the lurchThe college \u2019 s associate vice president of student wellness be quote a say  \u201c We be fortunate to be situate in  city   where there be a strong medical community rich with resources \u201d As if to say that student can just go elsewhere  I \u2019 ve tried \u201c elsewhere \u201d around here  a an adult  and it be a superfrustrating process  If I think back to who I be at age 18 or 19  disrupt care at the oncampus center in this regard would have definitely send me into a tailspin andor mental health crisis  I would have felt like I didn \u2019 t have the mean or psychic energy to find out another path  I would have felt deeply cut  in a personal way  by my institution \u2019 s sudden change in policyIt just seem like this college be at the forefront \u2013 it could have lay the groundwork for other area place of high education to follow  And then it just take a huge leap back into the wrong direction  One step forward  two step back sometimes I guess  right  I have a bunch of problem with get continuous care  I be first get hormone from a sketchyass doctor  I finally felt so disgust with his practice that I seek out another path  I go to one specifically because she be list a be LGBT friendly and knowledgeable  That end up be wrong basically \u2013 she tell me she didn \u2019 t know how she have get on that resource list  I have to have a pretty heat conversation with her \u2013 her stance first be that I could come to her for primary care  but I should continue to get my hormone prescription through that other doctor  I tell her I wasn \u2019 t go to do that  She tell me this be beyond her scope and if she have a male patient with lowtestosterone  she would not even monitor him for that reasonWe finally land on a compromise  She would continue to prescribe what I be already at  and she would monitor that  If I want to make any change though  I would have to do that through other meansWhen I do want to make other change  I first get on a long waiting list for an LGBTspecific clinic  I keep hear negative story about the quality of care there  so I decide to also try another approach  an endocrinologist  I have to get on a long waiting list for that  as well  I \u2019 ve be go there since January  and so far  I \u2019 m happy because I don \u2019 t have to deal with the PCP anymore  Getting an endo be not like add yet another medical professional and another series of appointment  It be more like  instead  Unless I get like  a rash or something  then I \u2019 d go back to my PCPAll of this be hard enough  and I be an adult who have work really hard at advocate for myself  Thinking back to who I be a a student I would have wither under this kind of stress  Students need to be able to access transspecific care on their campus  PeriodA note about the lack of specific in this post  I leave out the doctor \u2019 s name and the name of the college  city  etc  because that \u2019 s be the way I \u2019 ve always operate with this blog  in order to keep some anonymity  I \u2019 m not sure anymore whether it \u2019 s all necessary  but I \u2019 m not about to try to figure that out hereandnow  If you \u2019 d like specific and the name of the source I get a lot of this information from  just leave a comment  and I \u2019 ll get back to you  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
