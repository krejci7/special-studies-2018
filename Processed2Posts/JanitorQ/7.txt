up against very much resistance or ugliness a I \u2019 ve come out  in stage  in different way  over the span of like 18 year  I \u2019 ve be call rude thing out car window  I \u2019 ve have uncomfortable and disconcert medical appointment  I \u2019 ve face silenceasacceptance    from certain family member  I \u2019 m still deal with people not grasp the right pronoun  or refer to my spouse a my \u201c friend \u201d But these thing have be few and far between  and although they do add up  they don \u2019 t feel terribly crush  Most of the hard feeling have come from within  and not outside forcesTwo week ago though  something come up that be deliberate  that would affect me long term  and that I can \u2019 t just let go  It \u2019 s my name plate at workI \u2019 ve work at this school for over 10 year  and I \u2019 ve struggle to find my place within the rest of the staff  As a default  I \u2019 ve be distant and outoftheloop for the most part  It take me 6 year to get a name on the custodial door at all  and that only happen when a new person start and he get his name on the door  Then it be suddenly  hey  wait a minute  I have be fine without one  or so I tell myself  because I \u2019 d rather not have one at all than be a \u201c Miss \u201d or a \u201c Ms \u201d or later a \u201c Mrs \u201d or even a \u201c Mr \u201d All of those feel cringeworthy and totally wrong for me  So when I be actually ask  and I say  \u201c KT  last name  \u201d and that be accept  I be thrill  That be the name I go by  It felt right  At the timeAnd then it didn \u2019 t  I come out at work last December  Holy what  that be a year ago  Part of this included talk to the principal about my name and pronoun change  I also make it clear that I be not transition to male  exactly  and I \u2019 d like it to be know I identify a in the middle or a a little bit of both gender  She reply that that distinction be not necessary  and that be more of a private thing  PS It isn \u2019 t  It \u2019 s my identity  Instead of decide I need to clarify in that moment though  I attempt to grasp onto other compromise and specific  So that  when she ask me about my name on the custodial door  it be immediately a nobrainer  \u201c Mx   last name   \u201d It \u2019 s another option  I say  It be in use  It \u2019 s a thing  I try to assure her  I say  \u201c If this be represent my name  then I don \u2019 t feel compel to spell out  in a come out email she be go to be send on my behalf  how I be neither gender  The title will speak for itself  and people can ask me if they want \u201d The principal nod  It felt very much like we have agree on this  She have tell me that it could say whatever I want although she would like there to be some uniformity with everyone else \u2019 s  Mx  seem perfect  I assume there be followthrough on thisAs the month go by and I still didn \u2019 t have a name on the door  my supervisor have rip off my old one   I wonder what be a reasonable amount of time to wait before ask what \u2019 s go on  But then I be out of work in May for mental health reason  And then it be summer  and stuff like that doesn \u2019 t get do over the summer  I again have a new coworker  I decide I would just ride in on his coattails  It would be easy  and that be the route I prefer to take at that time  And sure enough  within the first couple of week of school start back up in September  he get his name on the custodial door  And I still didn \u2019 t  It be Mr  last name   I go to the administrative assistant that day and ask about my name  She apologize for not add mine to the order  and she say she \u2019 d order it right then and there  I give her a piece of paper where I have write it out  so there \u2019 d be no confusion  Mx   last name  It take 2 month  but it finally come in 2 week ago  but it be all wrong  I check the custodial mail slot like I do most day  and I be appal to see two new name plate  one for me and one for my coworker \u2013 both of them be our first and last name  No title at all  My ear turn red  my pulse quicken  I pace around a little  try to move forward with my work while process this  The principal be still in her office  adjacent to the hall where these mail slot be  I start to gear up to approach her  but then I hesitate  think I should wait until I \u2019 m more levelheaded  I didn \u2019 t get a chance to decide because right in that moment  she leftMy first  more general thought be that this be disrespectful in a classist sense  Why should ours be the only name that don \u2019 t have a title with them  Other thought spiral out from there  most prominently  \u201c I don \u2019 t want to have to deal with this  \u201d When the name get put on the door  I tell my coworker that \u2019 s not what I want   He fail to change out his name plate  so mine be the only one with a first name   I then tell the administrative assistant  and she say this be the principal \u2019 s decision  Which I already figure  I just didn \u2019 t want to talk to her  For 5 day in a row  I gather myself to go talk to her  only to be meet with her on her way out the door right in that moment  So finally when pass her in the hall on the 6th day  I ask  \u201c Can I talk to you before you leave today  \u201d That work  I talk to her and it be no big deal on her end  I write out what I want  for a third time  and she say it \u2019 d be order the following day  Which be yesterday  We \u2019 ll see how long it take this time around  at this point it \u2019 s be over a year  ", "feedtitle":
