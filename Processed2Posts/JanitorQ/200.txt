shift work disorder \u201d come on  A rugged old gentleman in a flannel shirt be explain about how he hadn \u2019 t realize how his job might be affect his sleep pattern and quality of life  until his doctor ask him what hour he work  I laugh out loud  Then the commercial  which be for Nuvigil \u2013 use to improve wakefulness  go on to tell you to talk to your doctor  and then it go through the lengthy list of side effect  you know \u2013 the usual drillI think it be awesome to have dialogue about what \u2019 s go on in people \u2019 s life and what might be improve  whether it \u2019 s with a prescription or other change in lifestyle  And if have an official diagnosis help more people figure out what \u2019 s go on and what they can do about it  more power to them  Just\u2026 personally  I find it absurd that this wouldn \u2019 t be a natural line of thinking  I think about this kind of stuff all the timeI don \u2019 t work overnights  and be so glad for that   but I do have an \u201c off \u201d shift  Otherwise know a the \u201c Bshift \u201d  My coworker pronounces \u201c shift \u201d a \u201c trick  \u201d so I might interchange the two word from here on out \u2013 just a head up   I work 3pm1130pm  It be currently 1250AM a I write this  I \u2019 ll probably go to bed by 2AM  This be what I do  Monday through Friday  It mean that I never see my partner during the work week  We have to catch up via telephone  note  and email  which be sometimes extremely frustrating  It mean that I don \u2019 t see much of anyone during the work week  Like  some friend be go out to dinner for someone \u2019 s birthday  Sorry  can \u2019 t make it  You \u2019 re go to the movie  Sounds like fun  I stop be jealous over the stuff I be miss out on a long time ago  Better to just accept it  And  on special occasion  I can always just call in sick or work a half day or somethingI \u2019 ve find that there be often a natural camaraderie amongst people who work strange hour  For example  I \u2019 ll sometimes go to the grocery store  still in uniform  around midnight  and the cashier always want to tell me what time she get off work  And if I haven \u2019 t be in a while  she \u2019 ll ask  \u201c Where you be  \u201d Maybe the summer have pass by  I work like normal people during the summer   so I \u2019 ll say  \u201c Oh  I be on a different trick \u201d And she \u2019 ll say  \u201c That \u2019 s always the reason  Whenever I haven \u2019 t see someone in a while  it \u2019 s because their trick changed \u201d So  essentially  shift work disorder be a medical condition that can be diagnose and treat by a doctor   Phew   It occur when your job call you to duty and you end up fight against your natural circadian rhythm  It \u2019 ll cause insomnia when you \u2019 re try to sleep  and ES  excessive sleepiness \u2013 so relieve that there \u2019 s a medically cod shorten version for this term   while you need to work  Shift work disorder be invent in 2011 to help people figure out why they feel tiredWhoa  Ok  lem me try to go back to the point where I do think this be all positive if it help people improve their life  I just worry people will see an ad on TV  or their physician will bring it up with them first  and they \u2019 ll just mindlessly pile on more pill to the overmedicated massesLike I mention  I don \u2019 t work overnights  so my experience be not nearly as extreme a many people \u2019 s  But I do want to point out that I feel like my work  sleep schedule have actually create MORE room for circadian rhythm to do their thing  accord to the season  It seem only natural that people would feel the need to sleep more during the winter month  if they could  But I \u2019 d imagine most people \u2019 s schedule don \u2019 t allow for extra sleep  They have to get up with their alarm and get to work  Me  I can sleep as much a I want  apparently  I don \u2019 t generally have much go on in the morning or early afternoon before work  so  often I \u2019 d let myself sleep 910 hour a night when it really seem like I naturally tend toward this  roughly NovemberFebruary   A luxury  I know   I be actually start to feel concerned about all the oversleeping  I be waste so much time    but it abruptly right itself  in February  I could no longer sleep in  As if  my body know that spring be on the way and I good start get ready  Brand new diagnosis come soon  \u2013 sittingonthecouch disorder \u2013 textingwhiledriving disorder \u2013 junkfoodforlunch disorder \u2013 gender identity disorder Oh  wait\u2026 ", "feedtitle": "Page 20
