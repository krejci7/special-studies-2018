Transgender Health Standards of Care   7th edition  p 19  When I be 17 year old  I admit myself voluntarily to a psychiatric hospital  I think I be go to go there for a day or two  be able to finally catch my breath  and then work with those around me to make a plan for what I need  This be not what end up happen  I still want to leave after a day or two \u2013 that didn \u2019 t change \u2013 but suddenly  thing be get really confuse really fast  and lot of people have other plan for me  Since I be still a minor  I really have no say in what happen  I be there for 19 day  I be put on 3 different medication  I be tell I suffer a psychotic break  I be diagnose with bipolar disorder  base on how I be behave \u2013 shortterm \u2013 and thing I tell them  such a  \u201c I think I be bipolar \u201d   When I leave  I spiral into a major depressive episode that last about 4 month  and I felt highly unstable for year to come   This help confirm for me that I be  in fact  bipolar  Something I believe for about 6 more yearsI be most definitely not bipolar  I do go through a psychotic break  but in retrospect  I believe this could have be prevent have I not be hospitalize  I think  ultimately  I just have an extend panic attack  And have no idea what that be or felt like  I think go to the hospital be the only thing I could do to help myself in the momentFor the next 6 or so year  I comply with my mental health care  I take all my medication every day  a they be prescribe  and those med and dosage change a lot over the year   I go to all my appointment I be suppose to go to  I talk to therapist  psychiatric nurse practitioner  psychiatrist  I didn \u2019 t seem to be improve  In a lot of way  my mental state be get bad  I just follow along with the treatment plan because I didn \u2019 t know what else I could do  In fact though  I couldn \u2019 t really tell you what the treatment plan be  Was there a plan  I don \u2019 t recall that be a conversationAll of these experience have greatly shape who I be  and also my attitude toward health care provider  I \u2019 ll say right now  I be definitely bias and wary  Once I decide I wasn \u2019 t go to take medication that didn \u2019 t seem to help  and I wasn \u2019 t go to listen to idea that didn \u2019 t seem to make sense for me  there really be no go back  Pretty much drop out completely  except for go to a dentist and a chiropractor  haha  for a very long timeUntil I decide I want to access testosterone  I think I be go to need \u201c The Letter \u201d from a therapist  but in the end  the doctor I go to didn \u2019 t care about formality like that   He \u2019 s also a sketchy doctor though   I feel very adamant that I should be able to easily access testosterone for the rest of my life  Testosterone be do for me what antidepressants  mood stabilizer  and antipsychotic never quite do  And more  I don \u2019 t want to go through hassle to be able to get it  I \u2019 d go as far a to say that be challenge about it by a health care professional be highly trigger for me  Because when I be young  I be tell what would be best for me for so long  and I follow  And it be shitty  So now the dynamic be go to be the other way around  I know that \u2019 s extreme and reactionary  but I do feel that strongly at this point in time  I hope that a I age  I will mellow out about it  I \u2019 m sure there will be time that I \u2019 ll need help and I win \u2019 t know what be go on with my body  and I will be grateful for doctor \u2019 and specialist \u2019 expertise  As for now though  I \u2019 m not there yetAlthough my experience with mental health professional have be shaky at best  I believe strongly in the therapeutic effect of\u2026 well  therapy  haha   Without have be in therapy through those tough year  I would not be where I be today  no question  I learn how to talk and communicate from therapist  I learn how to stop be so hard on myself  I learn to let go of my past  I learn that I can not save others from their pain  I learn what thing really matter in life  and what thing I be spend waste energy on  It be the slow imaginable process  None of these gem felt like they be work for me at the time  but in return to therapy over these past 2 year  it all start to suddenly sink in  and I \u2019 ve make some real leap and bound  I feel grateful for that groundwork I start in my late teen and early twenty  through therapy  even though I could not feel the benefit whatsoever at the timeTwo year ago  I attend a workshop at the Philadelphia TransHealth Conference call  Who Needs Therapy  Some Thoughts on Mental Health and Gender Variance  It be largely an open discussion format  with a mix of mental health professional  people with experience be in therapy  mental health survivor  and others  Toward the end I have work up the courage to ask the group  \u201c What if I really connect with my therapist  but it be clear she be not knowledgeable about trans issue  Is it worth it to continue work with her if I want to explore this  Is it up to me to attempt to point her to resource if I want to keep work with her  \u201d Everyone who respond to me be very adamant that it be not up to me  and if she do not do the work on her own  I should find someone who be knowledgeable or who be immediately and clearly willing to do the work  It turn into a very impassioned discussion with a lot of people say the same thing  I leave feel really confusedIt have be very hard for me to find a therapist I click with  I \u2019 d go to a few in my midlatetwenties  and felt really dispirit  A couple of them be specifically gender therapist  In the end  I return to the main therapist I saw through some of my tough year  It be amaze to me she be still around and I could find her  Reconnecting with her again after 8 year be mindboggling in the best way possible  Despite the feedback I get at that workshop  I wasn \u2019 t about to let go of her so easily  Nor do I feel like educate her myself  or even ask directly what she do know and what she do not know  I just continue to tell her how I feel  and I didn \u2019 t ever get the impression that she didn \u2019 t understand or wasn \u2019 t go to work with me on that  However  when I ask her if she \u2019 d write me a letter for HRT if need be  she say  \u201c No  I don \u2019 t feel like I have that expertise \u201d And I appreciate that  It be all work incredibly wellWhen go to my new doctor  I could have possibly have an easy time if I be forthcoming with the fact that I \u2019 m in therapy for gender issue  although I \u2019 m not in therapy with a gender therapist   But I didn \u2019 t feel like I should have to  So I didn \u2019 t mention it  When the doctor ask me who be in my support network  I say my partner and my parent and friend  I leave out my therapist  When she tell me she would like to collaborate with the gender identity youth clinic in make a plan for me  I could have save some time and hassle by say  \u201c My therapist already talk with them  and they win \u2019 t see me because of my age  So the plan B be this \u201d But I didn \u2019 t  I just say  that \u2019 d be great and let my doctor make the phone call and come to that same conclusion on her ownWhy  Because I think that therapy be an important part of my wellbeing  And I think that get the best medical care possible  for what I need  will also be an important part of my wellbeing  And I don \u2019 t feel like the two necessarily need to have much to do with each other  Specifically  I don \u2019 t want to suddenly be take more seriously and be give what I need  genderwise  because I be in therapy  I want what I say to be enough  I want to access hormone without it be know I \u2019 m in therapy  if I canI be deliberately attempt to lay some of the groundwork  say that this be perfectly acceptable  Not all of u live within access to clinic or doctor who offer the Informed Consent model  But I feel like I be in a position where I can work to change that  ", "feedtitle": "Page 19 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
