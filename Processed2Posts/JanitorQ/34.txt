He say  \u201c Thanks for share your blog with the world  \u201d and he direct me to his website where you can stream his music  He recently put out a new EP  call \u201c Gay Pirates \u201d He say  \u201c I be hear a lot of love song  but none of those love song have any queer representation  I want a narrative that speak to my identity a a gay man  So that be how gay pirate come to be  I describe the EP a a series of lamentation and exaltation of a very gay love \u201d You can check it out here  Evan WestfalThe music be fun and catchy  the lyric be full of stuff like coy promise and sweet deceit  treasure chest and booty  tight shirt  resiliency  and a \u201c rag sea of hormones \u201d My favorite be probably the title trackI ask him a couple of question  because he \u2019 s get a lot go on behind the scene  and because I be really curious what it \u2019 s like to live in Edmonton  He say  If I have to explain Alberta to an American  I would say that  culturally  it \u2019 s the Texas of Canada  Politically Alberta be fairly conservative  and it \u2019 s also a Province that be rich in oil  A lot of our citizen be tradespeople that work on oil rig  As for my city  Edmonton itself be a really cool city  A river valley run through the centre of the city  it \u2019 s rich in wildlife and flora  The city have a fantastic pride centre  and lot of other queer organization  To answer your question regard weather and topography  Edmonton be really cold in the winter  and really hot in the summer  You be correct  the surround area be prairiesThe pride festival be really cool  Edmonton have it \u2019 s first parade in the 1990 \u2019 s  and it be very small  and most of the participant wear bag over their head to hide their identity  Flash forward to the millennium  and thing have change quite a bit  In the last few year our city hall have raise a pride flag  the Edmonton public school board be a marshall for the parade  and the Canadian Forces Base in Edmonton raise the pride flag  Each year over 30 \u2019 000 people attend the parade  This year the pride festival \u2019 s theme be \u201c one pride many voices \u201d The festival say they \u2019 re take stride to become more inclusive  I think this be a great approach  a pride could definitely stand to be more intersectional and welcomingI ask what his musical background be  and also what instrument he play  do he collaborate  He say  My background with music begin with my schooling  I be a graduate of the Canadian College of Performing Arts  it \u2019 s a musical theatre program in Victoria  British Columbia  I think you \u2019 ll notice some heavy influence of musical theatre in my songwriting  I then decide to focus on commercial contemporary music  I achieve that through matriculating at MacEwan University  As a musician I \u2019 ve have the opportunity to sing backing vocal for Josh Groban  to play for the opening ceremony for the Edmonton Pride Festival  I \u2019 ve perform with Opera Nuova  an Edmonton base opera company   and I \u2019 ve produce and perform in many cabaret  Right now I \u2019 m work on a music video for my song \u201c Gay Pirates  \u201d it should be out in a month or two  As for instrumentation  I play the piano and sing  On my track Gay Pirates  I write all the song  but I have some great musician \u2019 s record with me  I have to send a thank you to my drummer Julissa Bayer  guitar player Andrew Brostrom  and Bassist David PollockHe also mention that he volunteer with an outreach program call fYerfly  so I ask him to elaborate on that too  fYrefly be a great program  The name be an initialism that stand for  fostering Youth resilience energy leadership fun leadership yeah  You might notice the Y be capitalize  that \u2019 s because youth be the most important part  fYrefly originate a a summer leadership camp for LGBTTQ2SIA youth between the age of 1424  I attend the program a a teen  and it change my life  For the first time in my life I get to be surround by people like me  I get to share a sense of camaraderie  and I get to feel pure acceptance  I love the experience so much that I spend over a decade volunteer for fYrefly  Every year it \u2019 s a treat to see the difference the camp make for youthI \u2019 m just go to repeat that acronym  \u201c foster Youth resilience energy leadership fun leadership yeah
