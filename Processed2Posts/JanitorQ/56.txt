the past  I haven \u2019 t observe either through writing here  but I currently have a lot to say about both  this \u2019 ll probably end up be one of my more personal post  at least a of latelyFirst just real quick \u2013 a little bit of background  information about both  World Mental Health Day  Oct 10th  be first celebrate in 1992 at the initiative of the World Federation for Mental Health  a global mental health organization with member and contact in more than 150 country  This year \u2019 s theme be \u201c psychological first aid \u201d My first think be that it refer to how to handle someone who be in a mental health crisis  but it actually refer to be a support to someone who just witness or experience a terrible tragedy  There be a world of difference between the two  even though there \u2019 s also overlap  of course  learn about both type of situation be go to be importantNat \u2019 l Coming Out Day  Oct 11th  be found in 1988 by Robert Eichberg and Jean O \u2019 Leary  Oct 11th be choose to commemorate the anniversary of the 1987 Nat \u2019 l March on Washington for Gay and Lesbian Rights  It be observe in the spirit of the personal be political and the idea that homophobia can not thrive once people know someone personally who be LGBT   Information be come from the World Health Organization website and wikipedia   Last night  I saw an amazing documentary call Strike A Pose  which just come out last year  It \u2019 s about the seven young male dancer from the NYC underground  the origin of voguing  who be personally select by Madonna for her tour  They also end up star in a behindthescenes documentary at the time  call Truth or Dare  Madonna be very outspoken about AIDS  gay right  safe sex  and of course  Expressing Yourself   Spoiler Alert   What be most interesting though  be that at the same time these young men be embody those message on her behalf  they be not all on board or comfortable with it  Three of the men have be diagnose with HIV prior to the start of the tour  and they all be silent about it to the extreme  not even tell friend or love one  Also  one of the men sue Madonna after the tour  for force outing  partially spur by a coerced kiss with one of the other dancer in the Truth or Dare doc  He be not ready or willing to be that person  to be make that statementSo  I guess what I \u2019 m say with all that be that Nat \u2019 l Coming Out Day be great and celebratory and everything  but in order to actually be empower  it have to be on each individual \u2019 own term  Once I out a friend  about something totally unrelated to be LGBT  a part of a joke  and then I felt really crummy about it  I just let time wash over that one  but it \u2019 s still a prominent memorySo where be I at  I still have a fair share of come out to do  I \u2019 m not do any of it today  It do feel imminent though \u2013 I \u2019 d say within the next 6 month  I look forward to the day that my driver \u2019 s license  signature  little plastic rectangle on the custodial office  Facebook page  the word out of teacher \u2019 and coworker \u2019 mouth  and everything else  all say the same thing  As of now  I have 5 different name go on in different place  and none of them be the full name I actually want to go by  Here \u2019 s something I write that really capture this feeling  I write it almost exactly 2 year ago  Dang  that be a long time    Fractured identity and fragment feelingsMoving on to mental health  My mental health have improve by leap and bound within the past 9 month  and I have not write about it  Actually  the most recent thing I do write be 9 month ago  here  A full year later  Making major change  I be hopeful but tentative  I have have 23 good day in a row  an anomaly   due to start yet another drug  I be still on that drug  and I be still have good day after good day after good day  other than not so great day due to a cold  a handful of really bad day during the stress of surgery  Overall  I be more stable and happy than I ever have be before  BY FAR  And I feel certain that I can attribute that to a drug  something I never would have think possible before  I \u2019 ve be on lot of drug over a span of many year  and do not have a good experience with any of them  I have go off medication completely for 10 year because I think it be hopeless  I always downplay the usefulness of psychotropic drug  When I be young  I think I be the only one who have this reaction  now I know it \u2019 s fairly common to have to go through a trial and error period  search for something that will actually be a good matchDuring those 10 year I be not take medication  I focus on other thing to improve my wellbeing  Most of that be social in nature \u2013 focus on not isolate  focus on positive connection with people  focus on emotional intimacy  It work  To an extent  I start to think that get back into therapy would probably help  That work too  It felt miraculous for a while at first  actually  But a the year go by  kinda only to an extent  I find myself in a situation where I HAD to get back on medication  and I be not happy about that at all  In fact  I recall think a lot about when I \u2019 d be able to get off of them  maybe 6 month  I be thinking\u2026  In the end  it have work out well than I ever could have imagine  I be neither promed nor antimed  It \u2019 s way too personal  and different for each individual  to have a general feeling about it  But I can say that I use to be antimed  and now I feel that  for some people  it can be that one game changer that make all the difference  ", "feedtitle": "Page 6 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
