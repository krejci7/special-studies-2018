s Make Friends \u2013 This be an informal space for people to share their experience and connect by raise their hand and take turn  The room be pack  It be really hard to hear a lot of what people say  and unfortunately no one suggest use the microphone on hand  Someone near me say something I \u2019 d never hear before \u2013 they say they identify a demigender  mean their gender expression match their gender assign at birth  they just don \u2019 t totally feel that way internallyBelow the Belt  A Frank Discussion of Trans Male Genitalia \u2013 This workshop be lead by Trystan Cotten  the founder of Transgress Press  He lead the room in generate a long list of topic and concern  and then we pick a few to discuss far  There be a huge range in what be bring up \u2013 it be only minimally about genital surgery  We talk about hysterectomy and the option within that  reproductive issue  how transmen relate to or don \u2019 t relate to their junk  menstruation  etc  It be really well organize and facilitatedResults from the TransYouth Family Allies Research  TYFA  Study \u2013 This be a groundbreaking collection of data that illuminate what \u2019 s go on for transyouth and their family  Unfortunately  I walk in late and miss the segment talk about the result  but another blog writer sum it up here  Results from TYFA study  I do learn that another survey be in the work to glean more information  The first online survey be 117 parent  mostly white mom  only 6 dad   They be plan both a longitudinal followup from the first study  and also a 2nd cohort to touch on gender fluidity and nonbinary identity  delve far into selfharm and suicidality  and harassment and discriminationThe Rebirth of Paris Documentary \u2013 A very well do update of where the ballroom scene have be and be currently  since Paris be Burning  Directed by Seven KingThe Future of Gender Queer \u2013 This be the first of two nonbinaryrelated workshop that I go to  one right after the other  They be very different  This one be moderate by Ignacio Rivera  who I look up to a someone do amazing research in the field of nonbinary identity  Last year  I be blow away by their presentation of \u201c A Gender Not Listed Here \u201d They be currently work on a 2nd  followup survey at the National Center for Transgender Equality  It be go to be available mid August at http  wwwustranssurveyorg We should all take this survey  They lead a panel with two other people  but also make sure to get lot of audience participation  We start by map out our individual gender journey over the year  divide by how we felt vs how we be perceive by the world  We then meander through how we felt a genderqueer people  navigate the world  by raise our hand and speak a one big group  with the help of a microphone this time   Feels like we only touch on what could be talk aboutNonBinary  In  visibility  Empowerment and SelfDetermination  \u2013 This be facilitate very differently and be more of a selfexploration and smallgroup sharing workshop  These can sometimes feel intimidate  talk to stranger in small group   but I felt fine and liked my group  We first write down three way we celebrate and share our nonbinary identity in the world  and we also write 10 different answer to \u201c Who be I  \u201d We be then prompt to cross out 3 of them  then another 3  then another 3  At this point we get into small group and talk about how we determine which one to cross out and which one be leave  We also do \u201c 2 truth and a lie \u201d base on how we present ourselves or would like to present ourselves if we could  We wrap up with discuss way we can sustain support in our own community after leave the conference  Some of this felt a little selfindulgent and 101ish  but the small group discussion really make it worthwhileI be the T  an FTM Documentary \u2013 This be an ongoing project to film 10 FTM people in 10 different country  The film crew present a rough cut of the first segment  Isak from Norway  It be really well do and I can \u2019 t wait to see more from this project  After the first film be complete  they have plan to continue with transfeminine experience
