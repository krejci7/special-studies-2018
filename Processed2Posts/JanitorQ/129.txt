What be 23 question  or as many a you like  that one should NOT be ask a transgender person  What be 23 question  or as many a you like  that one SHOULD be ask a transgender person  This reader happen to be the marketing coordinator of Simmons College  the third US woman \u2019 s college to accept student who identify a transgender  She be wonder if I \u2019 d like to add to the conversation in the form of a blog post  Sure  So  officially  I be participate in Transforming the Dialogue  Simmons College \u2019 s online MSW program \u2018 s campaign to promote an educational conversation about the transgender community  By participate in this campaign  I will be offer my perspective on what TO ask and what to NOT ask transpeopleThe first thing to think about  it totally depend on how well you know the person  So  let \u2019 s break it down  If this be someone who be a stranger  and they just introduce themselves to you  say their name back to them be a great way to start out affirm who they be  Also ask  \u201c What be your preferred pronoun  \u201d be important so that you can address them to other people in the way they wantneed  This be a little tricky because we \u2019 re specifically talk about visibly transpeople here  You could be meet many transpeople throughout your life and not even know it  Then  personally  I would steer the conversation away from transrelated topic  unless they bring it up  Oftentimes  transpeople don \u2019 t want to talk about more personal aspect upon meet someone new  So any other great question fall into the general gettingtoknowyou category  \u201c What bring you here  \u201d Or  \u201c How do you know soandso  \u201d Or  \u201c How \u2019 s your day be so far  \u201d If you be talk to an acquaintance and want to get to know them good  instead of ask direct question about their experience  you could share some of your own \u2013 what be your childhood like  what be puberty like  Chances be your new acquaintance have a lot to say about grow up and will feel more comfortable share if you share first  Do NOT ask  \u201c do you feel like you be trap in the wrong body  \u201d This be a trope perpetuate by the medium that not all transpeople relate to  It \u2019 s kind of a sensationalized way of put it  It be a sound bite  Asking about their experience be a great way to get a good understand about how broad and different \u201c transnarratives \u201d really areIf you be a friend  ally of a transperson  there be a lot you can do and ask  You can specifically ask  \u201c What can I do to support you  \u201d It might mean correct pronoun in the moment in social situation for your transfriend   I know I have a hard time with this  and if someone do it for me  it feel affirm   It might mean explore gender expression together \u2013 maybe go out and try on different clothes or try out makeup together  If you be a trusted friend  more personal question to help you understand would probably be appropriate  \u201c What do gender dysphoria feel like  \u201d \u201c How would you define your gender  \u201d \u201c Where be you in your comingout process  \u201d These question can spark great conversation that let your transfriend know you be engage and interested and want to help if possibleIf you be in an intimate relationship with a transperson  ask a lot of question be essential  Transition related decision will affect both of you  emotionally  financially  and energywise  It \u2019 s important not to press for a timeline or throw in your two cent about what your partner should be do  You will need to adjust to the natural pace  it be a long process  and understand that there be go to be a lot of uncertainty  \u201c What can I do to support you  \u201d work well  but your partner might not really know in the moment  There will probably be time when gender dysphoria and frustration be acute \u2013 during those time  just be physically present and not ask any question might be best  In the bedroom  ask what be OK be a must  The way transpeople feel about their body and about sex can be wildly in flux and change from day to day  Asking  \u201c Is this OK  \u201d or \u201c what if I do this  \u201d or \u201c What feel good right now  \u201d be go to be good than phrase thing in the negative  such a  \u201c What be off limit right now  \u201d or \u201c Where can I touch you  \u201d These kind of question might lead to shutdown modeQuestions that be never appropriate be  \u201c Have you have any surgery yet  \u201d \u201c What be you go to do about your beard  \u201d \u201c Do you think you will be able to pass  \u201d Or anything else relate to their body and their appearance  This be personal and could be trigger  Not all transpeople have the same goal or timeline  Also  some people be nonbinary  and their transition goal might look very differentIf you don \u2019 t know the transperson very well yet  and you be not sure what be OK and what be not OK to ask  just use this rule of thumb  Is this something you would ask a cisgender person  Other than the preferred pronoun question  important question you might not ask a cisgender person  this will get you far in a social situation  ", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 janitorqueer"}
