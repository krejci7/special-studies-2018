where they be at  transitionwise and otherwise  We correspond for a bit  and they send this update  Hi  My name be Kale and I write a guest blog post for Kameron over a year ago when I first start take testosterone  I live  mostly  in Newfoundland  where it \u2019 s cold and grey a lot of the year  I suppose it go without say that a lot have change for me in the past year  I \u2019 m write this today after make a monumental change to my appearance and expression of self this very morning  After five year of have them I decide to cut off my dreadlock  I know some of you might be think \u201c what do that have to do with take testosterone or be transmasculine  \u201d Well  I believe that all the choice we make about our body  not just the big one like take hormone or have surgery  impact our experience of self enormously  And though I hate to think on my dread in a negative way I know they be a kind of crutch for me for a long time  If you think about it dread be very gender neutral  Whether a man or a woman have dread it doesn \u2019 t matter  the dread will more or less look the same  And certainly once my dread be long enough they obscure my neck  my slender feminine neckWell after a year it seem my neck isn \u2019 t as slender a it once be  In fact a lot of thing about my body be very different  It amaze me how I can feel so much the same and so very different all at the same time  On the one hand the difference feel right to me  feel like the me I always expect to be  and I know that make a huge difference  On the other hand I know there be so much about me that be the same  the integral part of me that will never change  no matter what  I think a lot of folk  myself include  fear change that will alter who they perceive themselves to be  It \u2019 s a legitimate fear but I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s ground in any reality  I know that I be the same person I \u2019 ve always be except now I feel closer to that person and so much happy  I should say that I identify with be transmasculine but do not feel comfortable with many label  Every label I \u2019 ve ever try on do not fit well enough to make me feel comfortable with it  Right now I like to say that I do not feel like a man or a woman  I feel like myself and that person have masculine and feminine traitsGenerally I feel more attuned to my masculine side and that be a huge factor in my choosing HRT  Being read a female  therefore feminine only  make me feel very unlike myself  I could not live that way feel like no one saw me for who I be  A year later my voice be pretty low and I have the faint line of hair over my upper lip  My vein pop out of my forearm and my pecs and shoulder have muscle they never have before  Strangers almost always think I \u2019 m a man  This be my new reality  It generally feel good to me but it \u2019 s not perfect  I \u2019 m not a man  I don \u2019 t really want to consistently be think of a one  I take what I can get though because in this society be see a neither a man nor a woman be a pretty unrealistic goal  I feel closer to my masculine side so be read a a man be less difficult than be read a a womanThe other huge reason I choose HRT be my association with my genitals and my experience of sex  For whatever reason I be curse with the desire to have male genitalia  It fuck suck  I can not imagine have bottom surgery despite the fact that I really would rather male genitalia  I \u2019 m so not ready to even entertain that idea and I don \u2019 t know if that will ever change  I wasn \u2019 t entirely sure what testosterone would do for my relationship with my genitals but it certainly seem worth try  This be hand down the best choice of my life  I can \u2019 t express how thankful I be that I have the ability to make this choice  Before HRT I often could not derive sexual pleasure from my junk  it just didn \u2019 t feel like it be a part of me  That feeling be exasperate  I felt incredible guilt because I love my partner but I could not enjoy sex with them  I don \u2019 t know how to describe the difference in my genitals other than it feel like what I imagine have male genitalia feel like  I have experience some clitoral growth but it \u2019 s so much more than that  The difference be mind blowing  truly  and I wish I could find the word to express what it actually feel like but I can \u2019 t seem to  I hate to use the cliche but it \u2019 s so accurate  my body feel like my body nowDespite all the way I be so thankful for testosterone  I don \u2019 t like to put excessive emphasis on HRT  It be right for me in that moment in time  It \u2019 s not necessarily the right choice for everyone  And certainly I don \u2019 t think HRT be the only thing that \u2019 s help me with my sense of self  If I want to I can think about my dread negatively  a be a crutch  Or I can think about them positively  a be a big part of how I express myself authentically  Having dreadlock and use HRT be both choice I make to feel closer to the person I feel inside  There \u2019 s so many way that we can learn to be happy in our own body and the only thing that matter be that  each individual person \u2019 s happiness  I be so happy I find the courage to choose HRT but there be still day I look in the mirror and wonder who I be  what I think I \u2019 m do  They \u2019 re less often  definitely  but they \u2019 re still there  This life be a journey  happiness be a journey and there \u2019 s no end until you \u2019 re dead  I wish I could say HRT make me completely whole and happy and yay now my day of feel dysphoria and sadness be over  But it \u2019 s just not true  Happiness be not something you attain once and that \u2019 s it  it \u2019 s something you have to always work for  My intent in say all this be to remind folk of certain reality  And I need to remember them as much a anyone  Life be hard  Go easy on yourself  Love yourself  no matter what you may feel sometimes  If there \u2019 s one thing I \u2019 ve take out of this last year and all my experience with my change body it \u2019 s thisI like how Kale start this piece with hairrelated change  and then get more into it from there  I also use my hairstyle to obscure my slender feminine neck  What be some thing you do to help feel more congruent with your gender identity  If you \u2019 d like to write a guest post
