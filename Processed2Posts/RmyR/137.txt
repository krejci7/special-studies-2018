worry me because he like everything intend for a she  I start this blog to connect with other family raise slightly effeminate  possibly gay son and to get advice from LGBTQ teen  adult and their parent about raise the next generation of the community  The first thing I learn from my reader be that my son \u2019 s effeminacy isn \u2019 t about his sexuality \u2014 it \u2019 s about his gender  If I have never start the blog I might still be try to figure out that and so many other thing  I \u2019 ve felt a lot of anxiety during these three year  Risk have always be a negative fourletter word for me and all of this have felt risky  start a blog  share a part of our family with who know who  admit that my son play with \u201c girl thing \u201d and \u201c wear girl clothes \u201d and that  at time  it make me feel uncomfortable  speak out  write a book  out my family  learn to live without be rule by fear  and begin to advocate openly  It would have be so much easy to spend the last three year work my day job  run the home  care for my kid  shop online  peruse the boredom trifecta of FacebookInstagramPinterest  and learn new skill  like knit or how to cook rice without a rice cooker  But  none of that would have help me grow up and grow a a person as much a this blog  book and raise a child with unique need have  I wouldn \u2019 t change a thing about my life  my path  my family  my friend or the last three year  It \u2019 s be amaze and I \u2019 ve be bless  Four month ago  on the morning of September 3  I get out of bed  put on my new blue dress and try to use hair and makeup  smoke and mirror and compression undergarment to disguise the fact that I hadn \u2019 t be sleep well and have be eat my feeling for week  I be prepare myself to be \u2014 the moment the camera start roll with me on the couch of The TODAY Show \u2013 to be the most hated woman and mother in America  It be a risk I be willing to take  Wholeheartedly  I \u2019 d be watch for year a very vocal member of the public and medium bash  threaten and harass mom like me  mom who be open about and unashamed of have a child who be differentlygendered andor openly homosexual  And  I be next  I think  I mean  I have take some heat  but nothing compare to that felt by others  Matt and I do our interview on The TODAY Show and no sooner be we off the couch than I receive my first hate email result from the appearance  \u201c Here it go  \u201d I think to myself  Then come the email of support and cry for help  Before the end of the day  I have more than 300 email  And  a it have be since I start my blog  for every email of hate  I receive dozen of email from people who be glad they have find my blog and book  I wasn \u2019 t hat  no  more than that  I be feel the love  And  by reveal our identity  we have do a lot to quiet two large group of our hater  Those who believe for year that my blog and family be work of fiction  We aren \u2019 t and we prove that when people get to see u in the flesh  Look  We \u2019 re real  We live and breathe  And  for year I have people ask \u201c where be this kid \u2019 s father   \u201d He \u2019 s right here  right beside on The TODAY Show couch  at most of my appearance  be quote in interview and write a kickass piece for The Atlantic in which he clarify  \u201c My son skip and twirl in a dress isn \u2019 t a sign that a strong male figure be miss from his life  to me it \u2019 s a sign that a strong male figure be fully vest in his life and commit to protect him and allow him to grow into the person who he be create to be \u201d I \u2019 ve gotten really good at ignore negativity  And  there \u2019 s still a lot of it out there  Do I read the comment make in response to what I write  Comments make on this blog  Yes  every single one  Comments make on other website where my essay be post  No  I can \u2019 t  It \u2019 s not healthy for me  And  I don \u2019 t publish the few  random negative comment that people attempt to make on my blog  I use to feel bad trash the negative comment on my blog  like I wasn \u2019 t be honest or fair or give everyone a voice or show both side of the story  But  you know what  It \u2019 s my blog  Everyone have a voice  I have one here  If hater want to be hear  they can start their own blog for me to not read  This be the year when I realize that I \u2019 ve grow up a ton since the start of all this  At 36  I finally feel like a fullfledged grown up  I want to do something with my life when and where I can  At last  I proudly  comfortably  fell like an adult and  I feel like raise a child like CJ  write this blog  my book and advocating be the main reason why  When I first start write  I would be experience something in life and think \u201c a blog post be happen right now \u201d That doesn \u2019 t happen a often any more  I have to be thankful for it  because it mean that we be so totally comfortable with CJ \u2019 s gender nonconformity that it doesn \u2019 t steal the spotlight  it isn \u2019 t a focal point  it doesn \u2019 t call out to get our attention and make u feel uncomfortable  worried  anxious or hope that others aren \u2019 t look  It \u2019 s just a part of him  We have come to a place of total acceptance  If you \u2019 ve be read my blog for long  I \u2019 m sure you \u2019 ve notice it  My write style have change  I \u2019 ve stop use wit and sas to deal with my uneasy feeling about the many facet of his gender creativeness and I \u2019 ve just start be really  really honest about my feeling  I \u2019 ve become more sincere  Allowing CJ  to be 100 percent CJ  help me to be 100 percent me  With the publication of my book and come out  I feel like I \u2019 ve align and merge the two life I felt I be live  There be blog life and real life  Now there be just one life  It \u2019 s easy that way  isn \u2019 t it  What \u2019 s next  This  This blog  This life  This family  And you  I hope  ", "feedtitle": "Page 14
