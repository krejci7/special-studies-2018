raise a gender nonconforming child  this week it \u2019 s Grandpa Colorado \u2019 s turn to speakwrite  Instead of Q  A style  Grandpa Colorado want to write about the thing that be on his mind most when he think about CJ  and our family  In Regards to CJ  One of Grandpa Colorado s favorite fishing spot  There be a truism in the statement \u201c once a parent  always a parent \u201d If I be to look at the circumstance lead up to become a traditional parent  I find many thing come into play  Find a partner  Marry her  When the time come in which you both agree that you be ready for a child and you say \u201c it \u2019 s time  \u201d be ready for life \u2019 s little disappointment and surprise  Failure to conceive this month and then the next month  The false pregnancy  the painful miscarriage be devastate and take you to a corner in your mind with yourself  But you find there be a plan\u2026two month  then three  now you tell your parent and your friend a you enter four  now five and watch your wife \u2019 s body change and you deal a best you can with her incredibility fascinating and weird situation  But always in the back of your mind a eight and now nine month approach you remember life \u2019 s little disappointment and surprise  What if the baby be not healthy  What will we do  I have always try to be a good father  There wasn \u2019 t a manual hand to me when the unbelievable event occur  so I decide to use my father a a sort of \u201c reverse barometer \u201d When parent my son  there would be no slapping in the face  no hit on the buttock or leg with a stick that they have to cut from a tree in the backyard  No shaking  no screaming  no slugging in the stomach and I would do my best not to have my son fear me  These be simple rule and I try my best to uphold them  like I say  there wasn \u2019 t a manual  I watch both my boy grow and experience life  I be \u2014 and be still \u2014 proud of their academic  sport participation and social skill  Their standard in school might have be a little difficult for them at time because their school be where I earn my living  I teach for 33 year in secondary education and expect their study and conduct toward teacher and coach to be more than average at all time  a little pressure  I \u2019 m sure  but it be in MY manual  The lake by Grandpa Colorado s house  As my child continue in their formal education they find their soul mate  beautiful young lady who share their value  their hope and their dream together  The marriage of my son hold such special anticipation  Grandchildren\u2026new boy  new girl  more family  we could hardly wait  My wife and I have be bless with grandchild who get old and wiser each year and we be parent of parent  Life be good  There be time in which I be jealous and it doesn \u2019 t speak well of my character  but I strongly feel that if we never feel jealousy we can never experience love  Nevertheless  I be jealous of the relationship my son and his wife  CJ \u2019 s Mom and Dad  have with their child  They be well parent than I ever be  way well  They guide and allow  a concept that I never invoke  Mine be control and approve  The love and respect and the fun that their child have for them give me pause  Is there some way I can go back  In my experience a a teacher and manage a class I try to be aware of behavior and be willing to correct inappropriate action from some student direct toward others  I hate bully  Long before I become 6 \u2019 4 \u201d and 240 pound I be bully by individual in grade school and couldn \u2019 t get away from them  No complaint to a teacher bring me relief  it be still with me today at age 65\u2026 this time  I \u2019 m glad I can \u2019 t go back  I would be afraid of my action  Grandpa Colorado s new puppy  In my classroom my method be simple  When \u201c jock \u201d or the socially \u201c cool \u201d or the wannabe \u201c thug \u201d start to get the upper hand on some individual that target individual be send to a counselor who  by prearrangement  keep himher in the office for ten minute \u201c just check their schedule \u201d while I talk to my class and remind them of life \u2019 s little disappointment  Their future child might not look right  maybe not talk or walk right  or just not fit in  \u201c Worse still  your future child could be on the playground or in the classroom with bully like YOU  How dare you  \u201d I \u2019 d say to my class  In the past  leader and follower have come to me and apologize for their behavior and have bring the victim into their circle  Toward the end of my teach career  I be see many example of this bully social behavior  I saw more and more child taunt by their \u201c friend  \u201d bully by individual that morph into group  exclude from athletic group  social group and academic group just because of that group \u2019 perception of what be correct  cool and normal  Friedrich Nietzsche the German philosopher once comment that human be the only animal that commit suicide  It be chill  but it be true  Our young child listen at time to the wrong people with tragic consequence  Their panic and sense of self worth at time push them to a place that be hard to imagine  It break my heart that I find myself at time powerless to undo what some people have do  I be sadden in my character in that I be now not recognize the good angel in people \u2019 soul but  instead  look for the evil in mankind instead of the good  My panic and fear be that I can \u2019 t be that teacher or the parent for my grandchild  but it be temper by the love and support that be extend by their true parent  We a a society have allow this community of bully and evil to flourish and we a a society have the power to stop it through education and voice  ", "feedtitle": "Page 24 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
