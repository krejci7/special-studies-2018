injured my back  Due to the extent of the injury  I be force into early retirement from law enforcement  While my family be happy I be leave a dangerous career  I have many reservation about be force into retirement  Yes  the thought of sleep during nighttime hour be something I have crave for year  but  I know I would miss the excitement  quick thinking and spontaneous problem solve I do on the job  I become the primary caregiver parent for our two boy while Lori start work more  A few week in my new role it become clear that I wouldn \u2019 t miss out on excitement  quick thinking and spontaneous problem solve  CJ  would provide it  Chase have always be a very easy child  He \u2019 s easygoing  he listen  he rarely argue  he \u2019 s not impulsive and he never raise his voice in frustration or to make his point  CJ  however  be a totally different story  This past summer be my first summer home with the boy full time  By August  I couldn \u2019 t wait for school to start  These be the kind of pic Matt and CJ  send me at work  I \u2019 ve work through tripledigit Southern California summer on the street in a wool uniform atop a bulletproof vest or lock in swelter stake out car with no air condition  Those summer weren \u2019 t the hardest  Summer 2017 be the hard because every day I have to match wit with a strong  sassy  opinionated  confident  creative  spontaneous 10yearold who be bore and adjust to have dad \u2013 not mom \u2013 home the most  Nothing be easy  If I say black  he say white  If I want yogurt  he want ice cream  If I want the pool  he want the beach  Everything be a battle  If I never hear \u201c Mom doesn \u2019 t do it that way\u2026 \u201d again  it will be too soon  He would tell me when I be have a bad hair day and need to put a hat on or if  bad yet  I be wear an unflattering outfit  How can swim trunk look \u201c not swimy \u201d and a tank top look \u201c too army \u201d  While Chase be busy with high school football practice and weight lifting  I be shuttle CJ from art camp to tennis lesson to sew camp  It be more than 100 damn degree and I be in and out of the car carry racquet  sew basket and more clay project than we have space for  Every day  after every camp  CJ  tell me how I didn \u2019 t pack a snack  I pack the wrong snack or I pack too much snack  how be that even possible   Matt let CJ  do his makeup to work on his skill  When I be work  I use to envy stayathome parent  I picture parent \u2013 especially moms \u2013 enjoy free time with their kid  During the summer I picture them lounge by the pool with their momfriends and their kid  read magazine  gossip and maybe sip on an adult beverage  I assume they felt kidfree a their child entertain themselves in the pool  During school holiday  I picture the stayathome mom sleep in  do a craft stressfree  watch a movie and feeling happy  relaxed and refresh  I \u2019 d be wrong  So wrong  That \u2019 s not stayathome life  I \u2019 m sorry for ever think it be  I know well now  Occasionally  I call Lori at work to vent about stayathome life  \u201c I have to go  Work be crazybusy today  \u201d she say to me  That use to be my line  Now it \u2019 s hers and it \u2019 s hard to hear  I know I can be difficult to deal with  I \u2019 m confident and loud  I have difficulty hide my true emotion  I \u2019 m honest to a fault  I can be impulsive  Being a stayathome parent  I \u2019 ve realize that CJ  be exactly like me  Lori always say so  but I never listen  How could an effeminate little boy who wear skirt and play with doll be exactly like me  But  he be  my feminine son be exactly like masculine me  It take me be home with him fulltime to see how glaringly obvious it be  Matt take CJ  to the church we be marry at  While spending countless hour with him in the car or at home do homework and project  we have grow incredibly close  For a father and son to have such different interest  pursuit and goal  we have the same humor  personality and sarcasm  Since be home with him fulltime  I \u2019 ve see his assuredness and confidence grow  He \u2019 s become strong  That \u2019 s not to say he \u2019 s become more masculine  it \u2019 s to say he \u2019 s become more confident and unapologetic in his feminine gender expression  He know he can be exactly who he be and he have all of my love and support  He can sashay into school wear French braid  carry his pink emoji lunchbox and he \u2013 and all of his schoolmate \u2013 know that I \u2019 ll greet him with a smile and hug when school get out  Being the primary caregiver parent have change me  too  I \u2019 ve grown  I retire before age 40  Most people say I \u2019 m lucky  and I be  but it also take some adjusting to  I go from be a cop to be the parent responsible for a lot of the emotional care of our child  I \u2019 ve trade traditional gender role with my wife to stay home with our blue teenager and pink boy  Now  I know where thing be at the grocery store and in the pantry and my wife doesn \u2019 t  It \u2019 s my job to know when we \u2019 re almost out of toilet paper and what flavor jelly the boy prefer at the moment  And kayak on the lake by our house  As much a we \u2019 ve pride ourselves in ignore society \u2019 s idea of traditional gender role  we \u2019 ve have some adjusting to do  At time  it \u2019 s be challenge for our relationship and my friendship with other guy  Longtime guy friend think it \u2019 s weird that I search Pinterest for recipe and know when the local bakery have 50 percent off cupcake  Tuesdays  and cooky  Thursdays   Our life have be full of adjustment  The adjustment be hard for a while  The loss of my professional identity  The physical pain of my injury  The role reversal in our marriage  Getting use to be the stayathome parent  But  a the four of u always do  we find our way  I \u2019 m so proud to be the father of our boy and grateful to be able to be home with them  I realize now more than ever that I miss a lot when I be work  This summer be difficult and challenging and the school year couldn \u2019 t come fast enough  Now  I see winter break winking at me from a few week away and I look the other way while I can  But  I wouldn \u2019 t change a thing  ", "feedtitle": "Raising My Rainbow"}
