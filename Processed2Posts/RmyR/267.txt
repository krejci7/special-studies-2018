player  \u201d CJ  be stand in front of my mirrored closet twist back and forth at the waist  watch his shimmery black athletic short \u2014 which be two size too big \u2014 sway below the knee a he move  \u201c That \u2019 s because you be a soccer player  \u201d I say with excitement  \u201c I be   \u201d \u201c Yep  \u201d \u201c Why be my costume green  I don \u2019 t like green  I like pink  And  purple  \u201d CJ  asks  not take his eye off of his reflection  \u201c Because you be on the Green Dragons  \u201d I \u2019 m try to exude total excitement and none of the apprehension that I really feel  Two day later we arrive at the first game  with be also the first practice when you \u2019 re on an \u201c Under 5  year old  \u201d AYSO team  CJ  meet his five teammate and his coach  They be all bounce around like they be hop up on Red Bull and fruit snack  A little boy name Nolan approach CJ  who be stand timidly by his brother  \u201c Give me five  \u201d Nolan shout  CJ  smile and give him five  It \u2019 s the passive version of a high five where you lay your palm out open and let the other person do the actual \u201c fiving \u201d \u201c Give me five  \u201d Nolan shout again  His energy be appreciate  but I \u2019 m glad that my kid take a while to warm up  Again  CJ  smile and present his palm  \u201c Now  I \u2019 m go to give you a hard five  \u201d Nolan shout  \u201c No  \u201d CJ  say and whisk his palm up to his heart  \u201c CJ  doesn \u2019 t do \u2018 hard five \u2019  \u201d CJ \u2019 s Brother say in warn to Nolan  who immediately turn and run in search of someone who do do \u201c hard fives \u201d The 30 minute practice be over before CJ  know it and we head to the game field  As we be walk he spy it  I saw it  I saw him see it and I know what be come  He point to the little girl in the pink AYSO uniform and say very loudly  \u201c Why do SHE get to wear pink and I don \u2019 t  \u201d \u201c Because you get pick for the green team  They don \u2019 t have a pink team for boy  And  this be one of those time when you get what you get and you don \u2019 t throw a fit \u201d CJ  be piss  confused and allaround disgruntle about the color of his uniform  but he keep walk to his field  If you \u2019 ve see kid this age play soccer  you know what it look like  A cluster of kid  with the ball in the middle move up and down the field  and sometimes off of the field  in a swarm of chaos and kicking that accomplish next to nothing  They kick the ball in the direction of whatever goal be close  with little regard to if it be their goal or not  CJ  follow the swarm of player and stay on the outskirt  prance and act like he really want to kick the ball  but I could almost hear his thought whisper to the ball  \u201c please don \u2019 t come to me  please don \u2019 t come to me \u201d At halftime  which be a grueling 15 minute in to the game  the kid be a sticky  sweaty mess with a coating of wet morning grass  CJ  join his fan for a drink of water and some orange  His shirt have come untucked in the frenzy of soccer action and he be twist it around in his fist  Just so you know  K Stew be largely believe to have the best tshirt knot in hollywood  \u201c Mama  can you tie my shirt in a knot right here  I dink it will be good dat way \u201d He indicate that he want his shirt in a knot on his right hipbone  CJ \u2019 s Dad give me a question look  \u201c Did you teach him that  \u201d \u201c No  I didn \u2019 t teach him to knot his shirt  Have you ever see me knot my shirt  I haven \u2019 t since the late 1980 \u2019 s  early 1990 \u2019 s when I wear a banana clip in my hair  \u201d I say in my own defense  \u201c Then where do he learn it  \u201d \u201c I don \u2019 t know  \u201d I turn to CJ  \u201c No  baby  we aren \u2019 t go to tie your jersey in a knot in the front  \u201d I say  \u201c Can we knot it in da back   \u201d CJ  ask  demonstrate how it would be do  CJ \u2019 s Dad look at me and roll his eye  \u201c No  baby  let \u2019 s just tuck it in again \u201d Halftime be over  so there be no debating which would look good  a retuck vs a knot in the front or back  CJ  continue to follow the swarm of player  keep to the perimeter  with his arm straight down and wrist at 90 degree angle  At one point the ball be kick by another player and it bounce off of CJ \u2019 s shin  He look at u and smile  Dimples deep and pride high  \u201c Good kick CJ   \u201d we all cheer from the sideline  On the way home CJ  regale how that bounce off of his shin be a kick that almost score a goal  I regale internally how his sporty jersey be almost turn into a oneofakind knot creation sure to go against AYSO boys \u2019 league standard  ", "feedtitle": "Page 27 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
