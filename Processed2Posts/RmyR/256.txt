glass and be tall for his age  We be in early elementary school and I could always count on my persuasive power to lure him toward the corner of the classroom where the pretend \u201c house \u201d be  There be a small kitchen  a bassinet and an olivegreencolored rotary phone with a long spiraling cord  That \u2019 s where it happen  That \u2019 s where I could convince him \u2013 when none of the other boy be pay attention \u2014 to be the Daddy  the token male who would play house with u  Finally  we have a traditional  nuclear family  I be the Mommy and Aaron be the Daddy  Sometimes we pose like we be get our family portrait take in the Sears photo studio  He sit on a stool  I be behind him with my two hand on one of his shoulder  he hold our baby in his arm  I play the part of Sears \u2019 s photographer  too  The picture be still in my mind  One big happy family  Poor Aaron  I think of him one morning last week  I be tie CJ \u2019 s shoe and notice that he have be quiet while get dress for school  CJ  be never quiet while get dress  after all  he have big opinion about what he should and shouldn \u2019 t wear  \u201c Mommy  today when we get to school  can you tell Gigi that I don \u2019 t wan na be the Daddy all the time  Sometimes I want to be the Mommy \u201d \u201c What   \u201d I ask  a little confused  \u201c When we play house at free time she always make me be the Daddy and sometimes I wan na be the Mommy \u201d I star at CJ  a numerous thought run through my mind  The NERVE of some little girl tell my son that he can \u2019 t be a Mommy  Well  at this point it really isn \u2019 t possible for him to be the Mommy  What do it matter to Gigi if CJ  want to be the Mommy  she really be a bossy little thing  Maybe CJ  need to learn that he do have to be the Daddy because he be the boy and boy be Daddies  How would Gigi \u2019 s parent feel about me and my son teach her a thing or two about gender and identity  Maybe CJ  can be the primary caregiver \u201c Daddy \u201d while the \u201c Papa \u201d be work the 9to5 at some hip ad agency or modern design firm  Or  maybe the \u201c Papa \u201d to CJ \u2019 s \u201c Daddy \u201d would be a lawyer or doctor  CJ  have a group of four or five girl he hang out with consistently at school  Occasionally another little redheaded boy will join the mix  At free time they like to play house and CJ  be always relegate to the role of Daddy  This  to most  would be the obvious and only choice for him  unless he want to be the baby  but he be way too type A for that  We be walk up to his classroom and he start cry  which he have never \u2013 in his illustrious  twoyear academic career \u2013 do  They be slow  silent tear  but they be there  \u201c What \u2019 s wrong  \u201d I ask a I kneel down to his level  \u201c Will you talk to Gigi  \u201d \u201c I \u2019 ll talk to Ms Sensible and I \u2019 ll help you  okay  \u201d I say  His peer file into the classroom and we hang out on the sideline  Ms Sensible could see that CJ  have be cry  \u201c We \u2019 re have a rough morning  Do you have a minute  \u201d \u201c Sure  \u201d she say I explain the situation to Ms Sensible  I explain that  sometimes  my son want to be a Mommy  not a Daddy  and the girl in the class win \u2019 t let him  I explain that I understand both side  \u201c I don \u2019 t know how to handle this  I \u2019 ve never do this before  \u201d I admit to her  \u201c Me neither  \u201d she say to me and we stand quietly  \u201c I \u2019 m go to email his therapist and see what she say  \u201d I say  \u201c Yeah  do that and let me know what she suggest  \u201d Ms Sensible say  \u201c For today  I \u2019 ll keep an eye on the situation \u201d \u201c Thank you \u201d CJ  look at u with hope in his eye  Today  he might get to be a Mommy  I email CJ \u2019 s therapist  She \u2019 s amazing  She \u2019 s cute  hip  sweet and spunky  I think she \u2019 s my age  If she weren \u2019 t my son \u2019 s therapist and there wasn \u2019 t the whole doctorpatient thing go on  I think we could hang out and have fun  We would get a manipedi while read gossip magazine and  then  sneak off for a Starbucks and some chocolate  Or  maybe we would meet up for dinner and each say \u201c yeah  I could do a glass of wine \u201d and that glass of wine would turn into two and a half glass each and we would end up in Nordstrom try on perfume and giggling uncontrollably at something that amuse no one else in the entire store  Maybe we would go to a farmer \u2019 s market  But  ala  in the real world  I only see her once a month when CJ  have an appointment  She specialize in gender issue  parent and child  So  she \u2019 s a perfect fit for u and well worth the hour and a half drive each way  Anyway  I email CJ \u2019 s therapist and she immediately prove why we adore her  I don \u2019 t know how she get so smart  but I \u2019 m glad she do  She say that we should step back and look at the big picture  \u201c CJ \u2019 s friend win \u2019 t let him  and it hurt him badly enough that he cry about it \u201d She tell me to encourage CJ  to use his word to express himself to his friend  tell them that they be hurt his feeling and ask them to stop the action that be hurt his feeling  Simple enough  right  We practice at home  \u201c I don \u2019 t wan na always be the Daddy  I wan na be the Mommy sometimes  too  It \u2019 s not fair that I always have to be the Daddy  \u201d CJ  tell me he be go to say to his girl friend  I pick CJ  up from school  \u201c How \u2019 d it go   \u201d I ask him  \u201c Gigi say no  I can \u2019 t be the Mommy  I always have \u2019 ta be the Daddy \u201d I listen and observe  He didn \u2019 t seem that upset  The next step be for Ms Sensible to talk with the girl to discuss the importance of take everyone \u2019 s feeling and opinion into consideration  It \u2019 s more a lesson in empathy than gender  We can all use a lesson on empathy every now and then  I think about look Aaron up on Facebook to possibly apologize for not ask him if he want to be the Mommy  instead of the Daddy  I don \u2019 t remember his last name  Maybe it \u2019 s for the best  But  Aaron  if you be read this  I \u2019 m sorry  I never think to ask if you want to be the Mommy  ", "feedtitle": "Page 26 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
