should leave his backpack at home because it be \u201c a trigger for bully \u201d and have \u201c become a distraction \u201d Your response surprise and anger me  I understand that I \u2019 m rely solely on the mother \u2019 s quote to the medium  but I certainly hope that you react good than that  After all  a youthserving professional you \u2019 re expect  trained and pay to act good than that  Why do I care  Because I have a son who be seven and carry a Monster High backpack to school everyday  I guess it \u2019 s a \u201c girl backpack \u201d I mean  it \u2019 s market mostly to girl  but he have never need a vagina to operate it  so it seem silly to say it \u2019 s \u201c for girls \u201d Because I \u2019 m raise a boy who mostly like thing market to girl  I \u2019 ve have to educate myself and our school and district about the law that they should already know  I think I \u2019 d take a minute to educate you  too  since you seem to be uninformed  Please get yourself familiar with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972  specifically the 2010 letter about Title IX issue by the United States Department of Education that be sign by the assistant secretary for civil right  \u201c Bullying foster a climate of fear and disrespect that can seriously impair the physical and psychological health of it victim and create condition that negatively affect learn  thereby undermine the ability of student to achieve their full potential  The movement to adopt antibullying policy reflect school \u2019 appreciation of their important responsibility to maintain a safe learning environment for all student     School district may violate these civil right statutes\u2026when peer harassment base on race  color  national origin  sex or disability be sufficiently serious that it create a hostile environment and such harassment be encourage  tolerate  not adequately address or ignore by school employees \u201d There be a whole section on genderbased harassment that you need to know  \u201c  Title IX  prohibit genderbased harassment  which may include act of verbal  nonverbal  or physical aggression  intimidation  or hostility base on sex or sexstereotyping  Thus  it can be sex discrimination if student be harass either for exhibit what be perceive a a stereotypical characteristic for their sex  or for fail to conform to stereotypical notion of masculinity and femininity  Title IX also prohibit sexual harassment and genderbased harassment of all student  regardless of the actual or perceive sexual orientation or gender identity of the harasser or target  Title IX protect all student  include lesbian  gay  bi sexual  and transgender  LGBT  student  from sex discrimination     The fact that the harassment include antiLGBT comment or be partly base on the target \u2019 s actual or perceive sexual orientation do not relieve a school of it obligation under Title IX to investigate and remedy overlap sexual harassment or genderbased harassment     The school  have  an obligation to take immediate and effective action to eliminate the hostile environment \u201d You see  Grayson have the right to carry the backpack of his choice \u2014 just like every other student in your school \u2013 and he have the right to a safe learning environment  You have an obligation to see to it that those right be protect  You need to improve your campus culture  follow the disciplinebehaviormanagement policy your school have adopt and send all student who have witness the homophobic bully the message that their right will be protect by school faculty and staff in accordance with state and federal law  Teach your student to do the right thing by lead by example  As much a you have fail Grayson  you \u2019 ve also fail his bully  You need to help them learn the difference between appropriate and inappropriate behavior  If backpack be trigger to these kid  they need help  They need to be able to see a backpack and not act out in dangerous  antisocial and harmful way  After all  backpack be everywhere  And  imagine  if your bully student be act like this in grade school  what kind of behavior will they be display in middle school  high school and beyond  when there be no school structure to support them  The ageinappropriate language and behavior of the bully indicate that they be child at risk  Research show that bully behavior be a predictive behavior of adult violence  You can help curb adult violence  so you should  I post the People Magazine article about Grayson and your school on my Facebook page  I receive 2553 like  407 comment and 216 share  Wow  that \u2019 s a lot  right  Most people agree with me that you should be work to modify the behavior of the bully  not the behavior of the bully  The people who disagree with me and agree with you have some typical response that be dangerous  narrowminded and hopefully aren \u2019 t share by youthserving professional such a yourself  Even if you do share those view  you can \u2019 t let them get in the way of law that you be obligate to abide by  Sincerely  Lori Duron ", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
