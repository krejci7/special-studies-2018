\u201c You look like one of those Mormon Duggars  \u201d Uncle Uncle say to me a we lunch recently and I contemplate cut my overgrown hair  \u201c They \u2019 re not Mormon  \u201d I reply  take a bite of chip and guac  \u201c That \u2019 s not the point  \u201d he say   Oh no he didn \u2019 t   \u201c How come Kim Kardashian and Angelina Jolie can have long hair  but I can \u2019 t  \u201d I ask defensively  think that my argument be solid  \u201c Shack up with Brad Pitt and we \u2019 ll talk  \u201d Uncle Uncle say to me  his favorite sister  with a smile  A couple month later Uncle Uncle come for a visit and we be watch CJ  play with his Strawberry Shortcake doll  I could tell that Uncle Uncle be deep in thought  I wait for it  I know some incredible insight be come  Picture this hairstyle  with red hair  on a fouryearold effeminate boy  That s CJ  \u201c CJ  have the same haircut a Liza Minnelli  \u201d he say thoughtfully  \u201c You know that old lady short do \u201d He be right and I couldn \u2019 t help but laugh  Haircuts be a tricky thing for CJ  He usually want his hair long like Rapunzel  Which be just fine  except that the minute his bang be long enough to get in his eye he get annoyed and go crazy  often time wagging fullon war  swat them out of the way and  then  crumble to the ground in defeat  He decide that he want short bang and long hair on the side and the back  I have a hard time be okay with that because he would look too much like the mascot for Dutch Boy Paint  CJ  often describe this haircut when ask how he want his hair  It \u2019 s an ageold problem  want beautiful long lock but not be patient enough for the grow out and style process  Whoopsie  CJ  s Mom cut bang like this  A few day ago  I decide to cut CJ \u2019 s bang myself because they be fall in his eye and ruin his life  The good news  He no longer look like Liza Minnelli  The bad news  He look more like Jim Carrey \u2019 s character from Dumb and Dumber  Just when I think it couldn \u2019 t get any bad  it do  I be over the long wait and service at our usual Cool Cuts 4 Kids  so I decide to take CJ  and pop into Hair Masters  which be right next to our grocery store  We walk in  CJ  be wear a green hoodie  jean and white sneaker  He be carry a plush Rapunzel doll  but otherwise look all boy  The stylist take u to her station  \u201c What kind of cut do the pretty girl want  \u201d she ask  run her long acrylic through CJ \u2019 s superthick red hair  I ignore her because I simply think that she misspoke  She refer to CJ  a a girl again and I correct her  \u201c He \u2019 s a boy  \u201d I say with a look and tone that question her intelligence  \u201c Oh  I \u2019 m sorry  I saw the doll and\u2026  \u201d she trail off  Sadly enough  I \u2019 m get use to people apologize and trail off  CJ  s favorite part of get be hair cut  The styling cape  Duh  Two more time she refer to my son a a girl  Was she crazy  Did she just not care  Was I overreact  I correct her each time she make the mistake  She proceed to give him the bad haircut of his life  She spray water in his face  scar him with the blow dryer and tell him that he need to concentrate on what he be do  Now  last time you get a haircut  do you have to concentrate on what you be do  I sure didn \u2019 t  \u201c If you tell HIM what you be go to do before you do it  this might go a little smoother  \u201d I say to her a she trim his bang and drop hair directly into his open eye  This lady be clueless and I be near tear or verbal assault  Finally  the great hair massacre of 2011 be over  \u201c What flavor lollipop do she want  \u201d she ask  CJ  look at me  Apparently we be both fight back tear  He choose grape and we leave  \u201c I \u2019 m sorry that lady wasn \u2019 t very nice  \u201d I say to CJ  \u201c Yeah  she be so inpropriate  \u201d he say a he enjoy his candy and skip along  There be no word   The next day I call to complain to the manager  who really couldn \u2019 t be bother with the detail of a customer \u2019 s bad experience  She offer to fix the botched job  We go back to the salon  but I \u2019 m not sure it be worth it  Apparently they be not  a their name would indicate  master of hair  If you \u2019 ve be follow our adventure  you know how important hair be to CJ  Right now  the poor little guy doesn \u2019 t like what he see in the mirror  That make me sad  because I always want my boy to like what they see in the mirror  I \u2019 m try to help him by get creative with the styling of his hair  We do the old Justin Beiber swoosh to one side and the Robert Pattinson bedhead dishevel look  We \u2019 ve even  at the suggestion and direction of CJ \u2019 s Brother  try the Nate Berkus  Those make him feel well  We \u2019 ll ride out this phase together until he once again like what he see in the mirror\u2026 and  in the meantime  we \u2019 ll look for a new stylist  ", "feedtitle": "Page 31 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
