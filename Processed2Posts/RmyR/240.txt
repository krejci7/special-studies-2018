hope her evolution be apparent to you  She go from not know what a blog be to be one of Raising My Rainbow \u2019 s big fan  She know the blog \u2019 s frequent commenters by name  She tell her friend about it when she be play mahjong at the community center and while do pilate at the rec center  I \u2019 m proud of her evolution\u2026 CJ \u2018 s Mom  When do you first notice that something be different about CJ  Grandma Colorado  When he be about three year old  Mom  What be different about him  Grandma  He always have a lego person or a stuffed animal and always want to have a conversation with you with your toy  He would always say  \u201c how be you today  what do you want to do today \u201d He always want to be the girl  I would say I \u2019 m the girl and he would say I could be a girl or a boy but he be definitely the girl in our conversation  Mom  Did you think it be a phase at first  Grandma  I think he be very bright and just show individuality  He be always very independent  Mom  Did him play with girl toy or dress up like a girl ever bother you  Grandma  I think it be unusual he want doll only and girl toy  I guess I think he would outgrow it  One of our friend have a neighbor boy who only play with the girl and love the tea party and such  He be now marry with four child and very happy  One Christmas CJ  only receive boy toy and he be devastate  Our son say it be the bad Christmas ever because CJ  be so angry at Santa and didn \u2019 t get anything he want  Our son say that would never happen again  That really hit home with u  You don \u2019 t want to deprive your child  The toys don \u2019 t bother u  The dress up be a little harder to accept  We worry more about how cruel other child can be  I \u2019 m accepting of whatever my child or any other person want to be  Mom  Do you or do you ever think we should make him conform  Grandma  CJ  will be whatever he will be  I don \u2019 t think he have a choice  I think you guy have do a wonderful job with CJ  and his brother  We just want our child to be happy and well adjust  Mom  Do you think he be bear this way  Is it his nature or his nurture  Grandma  I definitely think he be bear this way  I know many gay people who be happy and wonderful with lifetime partner  I don \u2019 t think you would choose this lifestyle  There be too many ignorant and cruel people out there  I just worry about his safety and happiness  Children can be so cruel  You can see this already in CJ \u2018 s neighborhood  Mom  How have have a child like CJ  in the family change you  Grandma  It have make be much more understanding and compassionate for child that don \u2019 t fit society \u2019 s mold  I feel I have always be very compassionate  but now I be more vocal about it  I stand up for the underdog  Like I say before I have a child in my charity organization that be very gender nonconforming  Now I always point out his pretty headband and how unique and special he be  Mom  Do you feel like an unexpected advocate  Grandma  Most definitely  I be so proud of you a parent and his big brother  I feel Uncle Uncle have make a huge impact on my son over the year  He have help make him more sensitive and understanding  My daughterinlove have make a huge impact on our family and we be very bless to have her in our family  Mom  What be your big fear for CJ  his brother and our family  Grandma  CJ  be a tiger  but a totally sensitive child  I worry for everyone when he go to school  I don \u2019 t want CJ \u2019 s spirit broken  I want him to be able to stand up to the bully  I fear for his brother because he be so kind  gentle and an absolute sweetheart  I don \u2019 t want him to have to change to protect his brother  I see this happen though and I see no way to change this  I see strong parent that be do an incredible job  They have a difficult situation  but CJ  couldn \u2019 t have good parent pick for this challenge  Our family be there to back you four up  We be all lion circle our cub  Mom  How be thing for LGBTQ kid when you be work at the local high school  Grandma  The kid pretty well accept them  I have an aide name B who  a a senior  be fine and his family have finally accept his sexuality  But  in his sophomore year he attempt suicide  As he tell it  it be a lame attempt  more of a plea to get his family to accept him a he be  Apparently it work because his father be very accept then and just glad he be alive  At the other school I transfer to  they have a large gay and lesbian group  They have meeting on campus and be very open about it  I think kid have become more accepting of it and not afraid  At least in the high school level  Mom  How do you think you would have parent a child like CJ  Grandma  Certainly not as well a you have  I think I would have be very confused  I probably would have blame it on myself for my child be like this  I would have wonder what I have do wrong  It would have take a while to accept  But  then you become supportive and just hope your child be not bully and hurt along the way  Mom  What do you think CJ  will be when he grow up  Grandma  An artist  architect or engineer  He be so exacting and a perfectionist when he color and draw  I be expect great thing from him  He be so dramatic and artistic he could be in theater also  Mom  What \u2019 s your favorite thing to do with CJ  Grandma  Run around and chase and scare him  draw with chalk  color  read to him  play doll and hike  he have great stamen    Mom  Anything else you want my blog reader to know  Grandma  In closing  I feel like my son and daughterinlaw have do a wonderful job with both of their child  They be lucky to have Uncle Uncle who can share and prepare them for what he have go through  They have a supportive family that want to love  share  help and see their family grow to their high potential for each individual  We fear for the ignorant people out there who be terrify of anything different  We have two beautiful and totally unique grandchild  We want their safety  happiness and them to be whatever they want to be  Love  Blessings  Grandma Colorado ", "feedtitle": "Page 24 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
