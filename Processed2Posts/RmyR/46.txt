\u2019 s when my son start see gay people  We be drive through West Hollywood on our way to Uncle Michael \u2019 s  Stopped at a red light on Santa Monica Boulevard  a very fit  shirtless  shortshortwearing  glisten  nothardtolookat man jog past our car  \u201c I see a gay guy  \u201d CJ  say and point  \u201c What   \u201d Matt and I say  turn simultaneously to look at CJ  \u201c That guy  right there  run  he \u2019 s gay  \u201d CJ  point again  nonchalantly  \u201c Okay  well  you don \u2019 t know if he \u2019 s gay or not\u2026 \u201d I say  even though  if I be a bet woman  I \u2019 d put money on the runner be gay  \u201c He \u2019 s gay  I know it  \u201d CJ  say surely  \u201c It \u2019 s not nice to point and say that  \u201d I say  It wasn \u2019 t my best use of a teachable moment  but we be almost to Shake Shack and I be hungry  A week or two later  CJ  and I be walk through the mall hold hand  I \u2019 m already sad for the day when he stop reach for me with his paint nail and rubber band bracelet   \u201c That guy be gay  \u201d he say to me and point  like he be point out a cute top in the window of Forever 21  I stop him and explain that  It \u2019 s not nice to point at people  It \u2019 s not cool to assume something about someone you don \u2019 t know  We see gay people \u2013 and straight people \u2014 all the time but we don \u2019 t announce it  Someone else \u2019 s sexuality be none of our business  \u201c I know  but I don \u2019 t know that gay person like I know all the other gay people  That \u2019 s a new gay person  \u201d CJ  explain  CJ  know and love a lot of gay people  it seem odd to him that he didn \u2019 t know the man at the mall or the man run in WeHo  I tell my brother that CJ  have point out a gay person again  Uncle Michael wasn \u2019 t happy with this new habit  \u201c You have to get him to stop do that  \u201d he say firmly  \u201c My whole life I felt like people be point out that I be gay  It \u2019 s not cool \u201d Days later  CJ  and I be watch a choir of high school student sing on America \u2019 s Got Talent  \u201c I see a gay person  \u201d CJ  say again  forget the lesson I teach him at the mall  \u201c Which one  \u201d I ask  It be a big group  CJ  pause the television  approach it  stand on his tippy toe and point to a boy in the middle of the very back row  \u201c You have no idea if he \u2019 s gay  You can barely see him  \u201d I argue  \u201c I be watch him  He \u2019 s gay  trust me \u201d \u201c What if someone point at you and say you be gay  \u201d \u201c I could work with that  \u201d he reply with a sassy nod of his head  \u201c How do you feel when people point at you and say that you like girl stuff  \u201d I ask  \u201c I don \u2019 t like that \u201d I explain that when a stranger point at you and say something  sometimes it \u2019 s hard to tell if they be be nice  mean or inquisitive  If you don \u2019 t like it when people do it to you  don \u2019 t do it to other people  But  this be in the privacy of our own home  The sing boy on America \u2019 s Got Talent have no clue that my son think he be gay  I texted my friend Jeff  \u201c Can you see gay people  Like be gaydar real  \u201d I write before explain the situation to him  Jeff think CJ  be just look for himself  for people who be like him  As a child  Jeff do the same thing \u2014 he just didn \u2019 t announce it to his parent  Some of my brother \u2019 s friend have the same reaction  That explanation seem the most likely  CJ  point out gay people like he do fellow redhead  I absolutely want CJ  to know and feel that there be other people like him out there  that he \u2019 s not an oddity  But  I also want him to have manner and be respectful  So  I explain that when he see someone whom he think be gay  he can always tell me privately  but it \u2019 s not okay to point and say it publicly   As you can tell  I have none of the parenting answer  I just make thing up a I go along   The third time be the charm  CJ \u2019 s much more discreet about see gay people and I remind him that it \u2019 s not cool to assume something about someone you don \u2019 t know  \u201c I see gay people  \u201d he \u2019 ll whisper to me with a smile  It \u2019 s like a wayless creepy version of the kid in The Sixth Sense who saw dead people  I look around and sometimes I see gay people too and sometimes I don \u2019 t  Sometimes only CJ  can  Question  If you be gay or lesbian  can you instinctively identify gay and lesbian people  Does gaydar really exist  How would you handle this parent situation  ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
