good brother  If his Christmas gift to you be 10 day and night of free childcare  If you be a parent  you will understand how priceless this gift be  If you \u2019 re not a parent  give this gift to someone you love  Uncle Michael have the boy for two night and three day during Spring Break  They go to the Shake Shack for lunch  Au Fudge for brunch  decorate cake at Duff \u2019 s Cakemix  host a dinner party  make \u201c Spaghetti Two Ways \u201d  don \u2019 t ask   visit the La Brea Tar Pits  stay up past their bedtime and count 110 cigarette butt on the ground during their stay  my kid be weird   CJ  and Chase think they have the best time  but Matt and I be wine taste so obviously we win  As we drive home from West Hollywood to Orange County  the boy be mostly quiet in the backseat  until CJ  shout  \u201c I forget to tell you  gurl    I \u2019 m a drag queen  \u201d Turns our  my brother have also let them watch RuPaul \u2019 s Drag Race  A few day later \u2014 after much begging \u2013 I agree to sit down and watch Drag Race with CJ  I have see clip from the show here and there  but never a full episode  \u201c You \u2019 re go to like this show  mom  When we watch it  we all get their \u2018 he \u2019 and \u2018 shes \u2019 mixed up like people do when they talk about me  \u201d he say  If that \u2019 s not a solid reason to watch  I don \u2019 t know what be  We start with the current season \u2019 s first episode and CJ  immediately start rapidfiring question that I could not answer  I have to text my brother  Over and over and over again  I use to think I be pretty knowledgeable about LGBTQ culture  Watching Drag Race with my nineyearold son have teach me that there be much for me to learn  I also texted my friend Jeff who watch Drag Race and be one of my goto people when it come to LGBTQrelated thing  Bob The Drag Queen continue to be CJ \u2019 s overall favorite contestant this season  while he think Kim Chi have the best makeup  \u201c That \u2019 s sad that Kim Chi \u2019 s mom  Mrs Chi  doesn \u2019 t know that she be a drag queen and wouldn \u2019 t approve  I would always tell you if I be a drag queen and I \u2019 d want you and dad and Chase to come to my show  \u201d My heart swell  When your son tell you that if he be a drag queen he \u2019 d want you to watch him perform  you know you \u2019 ve do something right a a parent  Naomi Smalls be still my favorite and I want her body  But I \u2019 m 38  have have two kid and like to eat chip  so it \u2019 s a dream that will never be realize  CJ \u2019 s favorite part of each episode be when the two final contestant have to lip sync for their life  He ask me if I \u2019 ve ever have to lip sync for my life  I have not  And  be warn Drag Race contestant current and future  if you take your heel andor wig off to lip sync for your life  CJ  will automatically yell at the TV that you need to sashay away  At first we be move very slowly through the season  When we finally do get catch up on the current season  CJ  ask if we could watch a past season while we wait for a new episode  I find season four for free on Amazon  Watching two season at once have me get all of my queen and challenge confuse  Thankfully CJ  remembers them all  even though he have a hard time remember his multiplication table   so he help me along  In conclusion  I \u2019 ll leave you with our house rule for watch the show  in case you need some boundary for yourself andor your house  Current Rules CJ  Must Follow In Order To Watch RuPaul \u2019 s Drag Race All homework must be do  You must watch it with your mom or dad  We don \u2019 t use the word \u201c fishy \u201d to describe people   He have no idea what this allude to   We don \u2019 t use the word \u201c bitch \u201d and \u201c fuck \u201d  Well  I do  but he \u2019 s not allow yet   Even though RuPaul say \u201c Condragulations \u201d the real word be \u201c Congratulations \u201d and we use that   In case it \u2019 s ever on a spelling test   We don \u2019 t put glue stick in our eyebrow until we be a little bit old or have adult supervision for the application and removal   I \u2019 m not look forward to deal with this mess   We don \u2019 t attempt to glue our wig to our head   I wouldn \u2019 t even know where to begin   We fast forward through \u201c Shade Throwing \u201d because that \u2019 s not a nice way to talk to people   I think he will eventually need to learn to throw shade  but not just yet   As soon a the show be over  it \u2019 s time to immediately sashay away to bed  ", "feedtitle": "Page 6
