season for u  It \u2019 s not because we have to wake up and get go early than we do all summer  which  yes  suck   And  it \u2019 s not because our day  once again  become dominate by schedule  homework and packing lunch  Back to school mark the annual peak in CJ \u2019 s anxiety level  which  in turn  make me more anxious than usual  though I try not to show it  especially to CJ   For CJ  it mark the start of week and month of selfediting and agonizing over every little decision  Will he wear girl clothes to school  Will he use the bathroom or hold it all day  Will he be brave enough to carry the \u201c girl \u201d backpack and lunchbox he cherish  Will he let his classmate see his true  colorful  quirky  fabulous  sparkly  sassy self  Or  will he play it safe  The start of first grade be the bad  He take baby step  and sometimes no step  toward be his authentic self and finally start share his gender nonconforming way with his classmate and classroom a full three month into the ninemonth school year  He didn \u2019 t feel truly accept and comfortable until five month after that first bell rang  It \u2019 s little thing  like pick a Monster High lunchbox  but refuse to carry it \u2013 opt  instead  for a plain brown paper bag \u2013 until November and not wear a headband to school until March  The day lead up to finally carry the Monster High lunchbox and rock the headband be fill with question and false start  \u201c Should I take my Monster High lunchbox tomorrow  \u2026I \u2019 m go to do it\u2026I \u2019 m go to take it\u2026Do you think the kid will make fun of me  \u2026Do you think anybody will bully me  \u2026Maybe I \u2019 ll just wait until tomorrow\u2026 \u201d My heart break with each step in the deliberation process  a I let him make his own decision while remind him that his father and I be supportive of whatever he decide because we love him no matter what  This August and into September  CJ  be get excited  not anxious  I worry that his usual slow  twoweek climb up Anxiety Mountain would  this year  be a race to the top in two day  I be brace myself  But  it never come  Then  the night before school be to start  a we be pack backpack  CJ  turn to me  \u201c Mom  I can \u2019 t decide \u201d \u201c Decide what  \u201d \u201c When I start second grade tomorrow  should I start a a boy or a girl  \u201d I panic  and not because my son might be my daughter  but because a social transition like he be suggest take at least more than the 12 hour he be give me \u2013 eight of which we be suppose to be asleep  \u201c I think that \u2019 s up to you  That \u2019 s a question that only you can answer  \u201d I say calmly while feel anything but  \u201c But  what do you think  Just tell me  \u201d he insist  \u201c I think you should go a you  I like you \u201d \u201c So  I should go a a boy because I \u2019 m a boy  A boy who like girl stuff  \u201d \u201c If that \u2019 s who you are \u201d \u201c That \u2019 s who I am \u201d \u201c Cool \u201d After I get CJ  and his brother to bed  I watch reality television and eat four more chocolate chip cooky than I should have  in an attempt to soothe my ache heart  I worry that the next day \u2014 the first day of school \u2014 would be drench in anxiety  It wasn \u2019 t  CJ  carefully lay out his outfit  Yes  it be decidedly more masculine than first day outfit from year past and much more so than the clothes he wear during the freedom of summer  but the decision wasn \u2019 t painful for him  He wear blue and purple plaid short and a polo shirt with a necktie print on it because he think it be \u201c fancy but not too hot \u201d He carry his pink backpack and pink rhinestone lunchbox without a second thought  We walk onto campus and be greet by one \u201c Hi CJ   \u201d after another  He smile and wave and get a little shy  He get in line and scoped out his new classmate  After three year at the same school  he know more than half of them  And  more importantly  they know him  By the third day of school  he have a wrist full of bracelet he \u2019 d bead himself and order from classmate who want a few of his oneofakind creation on their wrist too  Tomorrow mark the end of the first full week of school and I would never jinx u by say this have be the best back to school ever  so I \u2019 ll just say that CJ  be love second grade so far and his teacher read Matilda to the class and CJ  love Matilda  ", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
