My name be Lori and for nearly two and a half year now you \u2019 ve know me a the blogger CJ \u2019 s Mom  And  now I \u2019 m an author  Or  I will be on September 3  2013  I \u2019 m come out in a big way and you  my loyal reader  have have a hand in it  You share my writing with people through social medium  email  conversation and  sometimes  during whispered interaction when you know the other person would benefit from read about my sparkly son  Because of your support I catch the attention of some pretty important people  Now  in less than five month  I \u2019 ll be share our life with a broad audience when the Random House \u2019 s Broadway imprint release Raising My Rainbow \u2014 my book base on my blog  It be with a massive amount of thought and consideration that I agree to write the book  Should we risk our anonymity  In do so  would we risk our safety  Did I even have the time to write a book while maintain my career  our home and our child \u2019 s sense of normalcy  Did I want to be the face of a cause  What would CJ  and his brother Chase think of the book now  What would they think of it in 10 year  20 year  In the end  CJ \u2019 s Dad Matt and I be and continue to be certain that a book like Raising My Rainbow be need to encourage the world to change for the sake of gender nonconforming and LGBTQ kid  We have to try  We have to try educate a many people a we can about child like CJ  so that hopefully  grow up and thrive from childhood to adolescence and beyond be the least painful experience possible  The book be a lot like the blog  It give people a glimpse into our life in hope that they will see that we be not weird \u2013 we be just different  And  different isn \u2019 t bad  Different can and do happen to anybody  Your neighbor  Your coworker  Your friend  Your enemy  You  The book be about expectation  You don \u2019 t always get what you expect when you be expect  When your child be bear you expect that their sex and gender will align  Sometimes they don \u2019 t  You expect that your male child will like traditionally male thing and that he \u2019 ll be physically and emotionally attract to a woman  Sometimes that doesn \u2019 t happen  There be comfort find in expectation  but when those expectation be squash when your child be three  four or five year old you start to question why they exist at all  You build new expectation and try not to be jade when people around you hold tight to the old one  The book be about empathy  It take u a while to realize that what we want most from other people be empathy  You don \u2019 t have to fully understand gender  sex and sexuality  we just ask that you have an open heart and an open mind  Imagine for a minute what our child and we have to go through on a daily basis  What would you do if you have a child like CJ  Judge less and imagine more  Treat others how you want to be treat  Period  The book be about the evolution of a family  When our son grab that first Barbie  we set out on a journey of evolution \u2013 though we didn \u2019 t know it at first  The evolution be slow and  at time  didn \u2019 t feel like it be move forward or felt like we be fight it  But  it happen  no one in our family be the same person that they be three year ago  Now  I wouldn \u2019 t change this experience for anything in the world  I couldn \u2019 t always say that  Finally  the book be about equality  There \u2019 s a new civil right movement happen in our country  It astonish me that in 2013 we need a civil right movement at all  It should be a give that all people be create equal and should be treat a such \u2013 whether it \u2019 s on the playground or in the nation \u2019 s capitol  The book be my way of take a firm stand in the movement  It be my way of publicly say that my son and brother deserve the same human right and human decency take for grant by the majority of the country \u2019 s population  I want my son to be treat like a human be  If you can \u2019 t tell if he be a boy or a girl  then just treat him like a person  As I move toward September 3 with excitement and fear  I hope that you will accompany me  You will never know how much you mean to my family and me  You all have teach me the difference between sex and gender  you have teach me how to parent an LGBTQ child  you have teach me how to get lipgloss out of my son \u2019 s hair when one particular makeover go awry  and the list go on and on  The blog will continue to exist a an outlet for me  Will I only be Lori now  No  I \u2019 m also CJ \u2019 s Mom  Which name will I use  I \u2019 m not sure  I have to see what feel comfortable  Will there be identify photo of our family on the blog now  Nope  I \u2019 ll continue to amaze you with my nondescript iPhone photography skill  Will I keep you update on book news from now on  You betcha  For u  life continue to be an adventure  I \u2019 m glad that you be along for the ride  I hope that you continue
