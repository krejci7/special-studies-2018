"\u201c Hi  I \u2019 d like to see if there be availability in the Saturday morning ballettap combo class  \u201d I say to the girl at the front desk of our local South Orange County youth gym  It \u2019 s a convert warehouse where a child can learn to play soccer  swim  cheerlead  take gymnastics  learn aerial art on silk  practice parkour  attend preschool  have a birthday party and do just about anything else that will keep business boom for the owner and cater to the OC ubermoms who pilot the blackedout Escalades park out front  \u201c How old be your daughter  \u201d the frontdesk girl ask while scan her computer screen  \u201c I don \u2019 t have a daughter  \u201d I say and star at her  It take her a while to realize that I have a boy who want to dance  \u201c Oh  I \u2019 m so sorry  we don \u2019 t have a tapballet combo class for boy  \u201d she reply sympathetically  stick her bottom lip out and tilt her head to the side  It \u2019 s the story of my life  \u201c Okay  Well  Is there room in your Saturday class  \u201d I ask  \u201c Yeah  do he want to be in there with girl  \u201d \u201c He \u2019 d love nothing more  \u201d I say  There be  in fact  room for CJ  in the class  He be go to die  CJ  have be in gymnastics for about a year and have be want to add the ballettap class to his schedule for month and month  But  since swim lesson would save his life  they take priority in the summer  Soccer season dominate the fall  although CJ  do not dominate soccer  All the star align when CJ  have a break in his schedule and two special Fairy Gay Fathers  whose initial be  oddly enough  C and J  ask if there be something they could do for CJ  and our family  Why  yes  there be something they could do  they could pay for a few month of CJ \u2019 s dance class so we could try it out and see if he like it as much a he think he would  We head to Payless Shoes to buy some tap shoe  CJ  could not control himself  When he saw those shiny  patent leather shoe that make loud noise  with huge black bow on top he be nearly embarrass by his own excitement  He hold them and rub them for a long while before he even think of put them on his foot  \u201c Those be girls \u2019 tap shoe  the boy tap shoe look like this  \u201d the Payless Shoe salesgirl with crunchy mousse hair say bending over  expose her crack and show u what boy tap shoe look like  The boys \u2019 shoe be not shiny  They be dull black with boring lace ups  no Mary Janelike cutout on top  \u201c I want the girl one  \u201d CJ  say to me quickly with a look of concern  \u201c I know you do  \u201d I say ignore Payless girl \u2019 s reaction  When it come to shoe we know what we like  We have this handle  thank you very much  On Saturday  I awake to a noise I be not familiar with  It wasn \u2019 t the house alarm  It wasn \u2019 t a video game  It wasn \u2019 t an alarm clock  Not my phone  I throw on my robe and stumble down the stair  try to pry my dry eye open and brush my bed head out of my face  The noise get louder  It wasn \u2019 t even 7 am \u201c Mommy  Good morning  Guess what today be   My dance class start today  \u201d CJ  say a he dance he tap his shoe on our kitchen tile  give Gregory Hines a run for his money  I make coffee and wonder how I be go to make two hour fly by  Finally  it be time to get dress  I have be dread this  \u201c Where \u2019 s my dance outfit  \u201d CJ  ask  a if I have be work on a sequined  lycra  organdy number in my free time  \u201c You can just wear workout short and a tshirt  \u201d I say  \u201c No I can \u2019 t  I need a tutu  \u201d Of course he do  The final ensemble be  the tights from his Frankie Stein Halloween costume that be green with fake scar and stitch on them  blue Nike athletic short  a purple tutu from his dress up drawer  his purple Handsome In Pink tshirt and black sock with skeleton on them  He look in the mirror and think he look perfect  like the dancer that live in his soul  Walking through the parking lot  through the gym and up to the secondfloor dance studio  it be obvious that not everyone think CJ  look as perfect a he think  We meet his teacher  I introduce her to CJ  and let her know that we need to borrow ballet shoe  She show u to the lose and find  \u201c I get to wear those   \u201d CJ  say smile  \u201c Yup \u201d \u201c ALL OF THEM   \u201d he squeal look at the tub of about 100 pink lose and find ballet shoe  \u201c No  silly  just two  you only have two feet \u201d \u201c Ahhhh  maaaaaaaaannnnnnnn \u201d If only he be a centipede  I return CJ  to Miss  MilkNHoney \u2019 s class and walk him just inside the door  A little girl point  \u201c A boy in ballet shoe  \u201d she laugh and point for the other girl to see  The little ballerina giggle  CJ  selfconsciously find a place on the mat and get ready to stretch  I explain to Miss  MilkNHoney that CJ  be gender nonconforming and she smile like she know what it mean  I think the tutu pretty much tip her off to the fact that CJ  isn \u2019 t your average boy  CJ \u2019 s therapist want u to work on own his gender nonconformity and to not be hesitant when there be the need to tell someone new  She doesn \u2019 t think we need to go around tell everybody or flaunt it  but when it feel like an appropriate thing to do  we should do it without pause  like we be just state the fact  there be room for a discussion if the person want to be educate  but there isn \u2019 t room for negative judgment  I think we be get good at it  It be what it be  I \u2019 m not label him for life  I \u2019 m give a name to what he be right now  I walk to the area where the parent sit and watch their tiny dancer  I look at the set of eye star at me a I find a seat  They be watch the new mom who just bring her son to an allgirls dance class  which have never see a boy before  And  he be wear a tutu and pink ballet shoe  To be continued\u2026 ", "feedtitle": "Page 26 \u2013 Raising My
