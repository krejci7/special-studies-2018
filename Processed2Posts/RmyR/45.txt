annual meeting for the American Academy of Pediatrics  AAP   AAP invite u and another family to speak to meet attendee about care for gender nonconforming and transgender youth  When ask what he specifically want pediatrician to keep in mind when work with differently gendered kid  CJ \u2019 s answer be something they don \u2019 t teach in medical school  Offer all sticker to all kid  not just boy sticker for boy and girl sticker for girl  AAP President Dr Benard P Dreyer be in the audience and publish the following letter in response to our panel  I plan on share it with our pediatrician and think you might want to do the same  Letter from the President  Pediatricians should not be transgender child \u2019 s first bully By  Benard P Dreyer  MD  FAAP  President  American Academy of Pediatrics Dr Dreyer As I sit at the AAP Districts II and VIII joint meeting in late June listen to two family talk about their experience with their young transgender child  I felt privilege to witness such love and acceptance \u2014 and such normal  happy child who just happen not to fit their \u201c assign \u201d or birth gender  I be proud to be an AAP member and a pediatrician  just a I be proud in April  when the North Carolina Chapter and national AAP call for repeal of North Carolina \u2019 s socalled \u201c bathroom bill  \u201d a law that deny transgender student access to gendersegregated space such a restroom and locker room in school  I \u2019 ve learn so much from these child and their family  First  gender dysphoria can start very early  Both child experience strong opinion about their gender at the age of 4 or 5  Second  there be a continuum in gender dysphoria  Both child have natal male gender  Yet one child change her name to reflect a female gender and insist she be a girl  while the other child want to be address with male pronoun in spite of a preference to dress like a girl and choose play and role traditionally engage in by girl  Both family stress how important it be for home to be a safe and accept space for the transgender child  When those child walk through the door of their home at the end of a school day  they should be able to be themselves without any judgment  As one of the father passionately say  \u201c I win \u2019 t be my child \u2019 s first bully  \u201d The pediatrician \u2019 s office  and the entire health care set  should be a safe  accept place as well  I be sad to receive an email from one of the parent tell of another family \u2019 s encounter with the health care system when they bring their 5yearold transgender daughter in for care for her serious chronic disease  The doctor refuse to treat her a a girl until she be old  and some have even call child protective service claim the mother be harm her child for allow her to live a a girl  This be do even though a study by Olson and colleague  publish in Pediatrics in March  show socially transition transgender child who be support in their gender identity have improve mental health outcome  Olson KR  Pediatrics  2016  137  e20153223  http  bitly29jaKIK   There appear to be no harm \u2014 and possible benefit \u2014 from such parentsupported early social transition  The parent ask the AAP to get the word out to our member about our support for transgender child and their family  I will paraphrase the statement make by one of the father and suggest we pledge that a physician  especially pediatrician  we not be our patient \u2019 first bully  It \u2019 s be 44 year since the release of \u201c Free to Be \u2026You and Me \u201d by Marlo Thomas and Friends  When it be first publish  my daughter be 5 year old  and I must have listen to every lyric in the book enough time to memorize them all  My beloved wife  Constance  make sure we have every version of the text  book  record album and video   After all  the point be to empower girl to believe they could do anything  empower boy to think outside the narrow constraint of male stereotype and empower all child to be unique individual  It have a major impact on my daughter who quote it to this day  Now I \u2019 m a grandfather with two granddaughter  so I \u2019 ve be listen to the lyric once more  This time  however  I \u2019 ve be think especially of transgender child and how the word so resonate with their world  I will end this column by speak directly to transgender child and youth with a quote from the book  I would like \u201c to remind you that you \u2019 re the hero of your own life adventure and that you can write your story any way that you dream it can be \u201d You be free to be whomever you want to be  Copyright \u00a9 2016 American Academy of Pediatrics ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
