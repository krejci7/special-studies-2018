his new cousin  Crap  I didn \u2019 t have to turn around to know what he be point at  He have see the shopping bag I have stash in the back of the car and cover with a beach towel  You see  we have welcome a new member into our extended family  CJ \u2019 s Dad \u2019 s brother and his wife have their second child and it be a girl  They wait to learn the sex of the baby until the birth  A few day after they call to say that a baby girl have be bear  I drop CJ  off at school and spend two hour shop for my new niece  I \u2019 m the last person who should be enforce traditional gender norm  I \u2019 m the last person who should be buy  100 worth of pink clothes  blanket and burp clothes  I should know good than to buy a teething ring that look like a giant engagement ring and rattle that look like a luxury handbag  But  I do it  I do it all and I \u2019 m not take it back  She \u2019 s the first girl in the family  there be no \u201c girl \u201d handmedown for her  she need clothes and when she \u2019 s a toddler I will buy her tool  the best router table when she \u2019 s old and car and dinosaur and encourage her to excel in math and science  I will be her auntie who will tell her that she can be anything that she want to be  president  astronaut  athlete  firefighter  But  for now  she can \u2019 t hold her head up  sleep through the night or see more than a few foot from her face and I want to see her in pink with ridiculously size flower and bow in her hair  I would paint her nail if I could  Where you might have previously think me to be a model citizen in the land of gender nonconformity  I have a niece and briefly become the queen of enforce gender norm  You be more than welcome to leave an admonishing comment below  I be bad  Real bad  But  I know that I couldn \u2019 t be that person in front of my child  So I go shop in secret  in private  while CJ  be at school and then hide the evidence to pack and ship later on the sly  \u201c What be all that pink stuff  Is it for me   \u201d CJ  ask again  \u201c It \u2019 s present for Baby Sarah  \u201d I say  know that it wasn \u2019 t go to be a short conversation  Playing with Grandma Colorado \u2019 s dog at his cousin \u2019 house  We have tell him about the arrival of Baby Sarah the night before at bedtime  I wasn \u2019 t exactly eager to tell him that there be a fullfledged girl in the family  but I have to after be reprimand by Grandma Colorado for not spread the good news  How would my gender nonconforming son react upon learn that the role of \u201c most feminine childgrandchild in the family \u201d that he have be occupy for nearly four year have be snatch from him by a baby  \u201c How come she isn \u2019 t just get hand me down  \u201d he ask  \u201c Because she be a girl and our family doesn \u2019 t have any baby girl hand me downs \u201d \u201c She can have my baby girl clothes hand me down  \u201d he offer  \u201c Baby  you only wear baby boy clothes \u201d I realize that my son probably can \u2019 t remember a time in his life when he wear exclusively boy clothes  \u201c How come you make me wear only boy clothes  \u201d he ask slightly disgust  \u201c Because I didn \u2019 t know that you like girl stuff  \u201d I answer honestly  \u201c How come you didn \u2019 t know that  \u201d \u201c Because you weren \u2019 t old enough to tell me or show me \u201d His sad face crush me  He be wonder why I didn \u2019 t know my own child  my baby  How could I have be so wrong about my child  Because I be full of assumption and expectation \u2014 none of which include my son be anything other than heteronormative  \u201c I \u2019 m sorry  baby  \u201d I say to CJ  A blanket statement to cover so much  When be the last time you awake to a fairy scale the fireplace in your bedroom  We saw Baby Sarah a few week later and I worry how CJ  would feel about the new member of our family who be everything he want to be  I secretly pray that Grandma and Grandpa Colorado wouldn \u2019 t go on and on about finally have a girl in the family after generation of only boys  I didn \u2019 t know how that would make CJ  feel  Thankfully they didn \u2019 t say anything to the effect  And  when CJ  get a chance to hold Baby Sarah he look up at me and smile that awardworthy smile of his  He gently adjust her pink hat and kiss her cheek  I hope that the two of them become great friends\u2026in pink or blue or whatever hue  ", "feedtitle": "Page 21 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
