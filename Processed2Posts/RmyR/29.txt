HuffingtonPostcom  During the last two week  I \u2019 ve read and hear a lot of misinformation about the rescission of federal guidance previously give to school regard the use of restroom and single sex space by transgender student  I be the mother of a gender nonconforming child who have be bully at school \u2014 with the most severe case occur in the bathroom  I \u2019 m also a person who think everyone should be treat equally and with kindness and empathy  So  understandably  the confusion surround the rescission cause me great concern  especially when it be evident in educator and administrator \u2013 the people who spend the most waking hour with transgender and gender nonconforming student  Title IX be still in effect and it protect student from bully  harassment and victimization base on presumed or confirmed sexuality  gender identity and gender expression  Over the summer  I survey educator and administrator about the federal  Title IX  and state law in place to protect student base on their presumed andor confirm sexual orientation  gender identity and gender expression  More than 500 credentialed educator and administrator from 43 state participate in the survey  Of participant  41 percent work at the elementary school  25 percent at middle school and 34 percent at high school  I ask for participation from people with all type of feeling about the LGBTQ community  The result of the survey be troublesome because they show just how little  if anything  educator know about Title IX and state law that protect student who be perceive or confirm to be LGBTQ  More than 50 percent of educator don \u2019 t know that there be federal law  Title IX  in place that protect student from bully  harassment and victimization base on confirmed or presume sexual orientation  gender identity and gender expression  About 50 percent of educator don \u2019 t know if their state have law in place to protect LGBTQ student  It \u2019 s important to clarify that the majority of the other 50 percent think that their state have law protect LGBTQ student  but they don \u2019 t know the type of law  there be two type of Safe School Laws and there be No Promo Homo law   If educator don \u2019 t know the federal and state law  they can \u2019 t enforce them or spot a violation  LGBTQ student in their charge aren \u2019 t be protect and care for a legally require and educator could be act illegally and culpably  What type of information be schoolsdistricts provide educator with regard Title IX and state law  Not much  According to 61 percent of educator  schoolsdistricts provide no information about LGBTQ law  \u201c Literally nothing  I work in the large countypublic school system in the state of North Carolina and although our state be in the midst of horrific action by our governor  who put HB2 into law  which require all people to use the bathroom that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate and not their gender   there have be no communication from the top down on this subject  Many teacher be not even aware that HB2 have anything to do with u a educators \u201d \u2014 Elementary School Educator  North Carolina \u201c None  I hear about a bathroom controversy with one of our student through the news and not from my own administration \u201d \u2014 High School Educator  North Carolina \u201c Little to none  bullying of any type be not a priority for administrators \u201d \u2014 High School Educator  Louisiana \u201c None  The district I work for be a hotbed for anyone who be not a True Christian  Our principal have send out email say that Catholics  Jews  Muslims should not be allow to teach  Secular or LGBTQ people don \u2019 t exist in his world \u201d \u2014 Elementary School Educator  Texas Eleven percent of educator report that their schooldistrict treat the negative and unlawful treatment of LGBTQ student a general bullying \u2013 even though the law be different and the effect can be more severe  \u201c We get the \u2018 normal \u2019 don \u2019 t bullyharass training each year that most adult sort of ignore a part of the go through the motion of start a school year \u201d \u2014 High School Educator  Missouri \u201c We receive a book  We be just hand it and basically tell to read it if we want  NO additional education or discussion \u201d \u2014 Elementary School Educator  California \u201c We get a big pamphlet about several issue around transgender issue  I \u2019 m guessing there \u2019 s more but I honestly didn \u2019 t go through the whole thing \u201d \u2014 Middle School Educator  California Two percent of educator learn about the right of LGBTQ student from the student themselves  not their schooldistrict   \u201c There be a Safe Zone training program create by member of student life  However  nothing that I can recall have come from administration regard antibullying laws \u201d \u2014 High School Educator  North Carolina If district aren \u2019 t educate their educator about Title IX and state law  should it be the responsibility of degree andor teacher credentialing program  That would be a good place to start  but 88 percent of educator learn nothing about the law while in college  Only five percent of educator have take a collegelevel course on discrimination in the classroom and equity on campus  The course be not LGBTQspecific  but cover all type of discrimination include  disability  learn difference  national origin  race  color  religion  sex  gender and sexuality  \u201c During the section on \u2018 special student \u2019  where we cover a whole bunch of different topic  like homeless student  student with mental illness  student with minor disability that don \u2019 t require special ed   We talk for about three hour about LGBTQ student  and student who have LGBTQ parent  It be pretty cringeworthy  and it be obvious the teacher didn \u2019 t really have any clue what they be talk about \u201d \u2014 Elementary School Educator  Montana I know that day in and day out educator be be tell the myriad way they be fail their student  I \u2019 m not here to do that  I acknowledge that educator  in general  want to help  after all  most get into education because they have a soft spot for child  Schoolsdistricts  credentialing program and professional development program be fail educator by not teach them about the special need of LGBTQ student  the risk they face  the law that protect them and the consequence of not follow the law  How do we make it easy for educator to learn these lesson if their employer and credentialing program aren \u2019 t teach them  Is it reasonable to expect educator to seek out the information and learn on their own  I don \u2019 t have the answer to those question  but I do know that until we find and implement the answer  school will feel unsafe for LGBTQ student  Some kid will pee their pant  like my son do  because bully live in the bathroom  some will drop out of because their future doesn \u2019 t seem as important a their present  and some will end their life because they have no hope that thing will get well  If you be an educator  please
