and they be antsy to go back  With Chase start fifth grade and CJ  start first grade  I have reach the momentous mommy milestone of have all of my child in fullday school  I get them both to where they need to be on the morning of September 10 and rush back home to park myself on the couch under a blanket to catch up on reality TV  while obsessively and repetitively check email and Facebook on my laptop and Instagram and Pinterest on my phone  Because that  my friend  be how I relax  As I get myself situate on the sofa the silence of the house catch my attention  It be quiet  Really quiet  The sound of summer be go  I get halfway through one episode of Teen Mom 3 and I have a bad feeling  What if  at that very moment  someone be try to dull CJ \u2019 s sparkle  What if he be be tease for his rainbowleopardprint backpack  What if he be be tease for his pink  heartcovered lunchbox  What if he be be tease for his hair that be grow out  What if  What if  What if  I couldn \u2019 t concentrate on mindless TV  Ugh  I think of that morning  I follow behind Chase a he walk onto campus  He be highfiving people through the hallway and reinforce why we call him \u201c The Mayor \u201d He know everybody and be full of a confidence that be more kind and innocent than cocky  He \u2019 s just a great  happy  friendly person  Thirty minute later we be at CJ \u2019 s school and he be hold onto my hand for dear life  The transition from kindergarten to first grade be a big deal  Gone be the halfday of instruction  private playground  protective atmosphere and kid and parent who know CJ  be  well  CJ  This year he have to stand in line on the playground with 1150 other first through sixth grader wait for the bell to ring  He be overwhelm  Understandably so  When I pick CJ  up from school  his teacher have the class in a single file line and be dismiss one student at a time  I could see CJ  at the back of the line  He look up at me and then immediately look down  He be fight back tear  I start to do the same  When he get to me  I ask him how his day be  \u201c Fine  \u201d he say a we walk  He be lie  We get into the car and the tear spill down his cheek  \u201c What \u2019 s wrong  baby  \u201d I ask  \u201c I spend all day afraid that the big kid be go to tease me cause they don \u2019 t know that I \u2019 m gender nonconforming yet  And  it be the long day ever  I \u2019 m tire  First grade be way too long  \u201d he explain  \u201c Who do you sit with at lunch  \u201d \u201c I sit at the boy \u2019 table and it be so boring \u201d There be not boys \u2019 table and girl \u2019 table at lunch  that \u2019 s just naturally how the kid divide  \u201c How come you didn \u2019 t sit with your girl friend  \u201d I ask  CJ  only have girl friend  \u201c Because I didn \u2019 t want the big boy to tease me \u201d \u201c Did the boy say anything about your lunchbox  \u201d I ask  He \u2019 d be not so patiently wait to use it for week  \u201c I didn \u2019 t carry it to the lunch table  I take all of my food out and carry it in my hand to the table so that nobody would see my lunchbox \u201d My heart break a I envision him try to carry a sandwich  juice box  chip  granola bar and slice fruit to the lunch table on the other side of campus  We roleplayed that night during bath time  \u201c What if someone say \u2018 why do you have a girl lunchbox  \u2019 \u201d I ask  \u201c I \u2019 d say because that \u2019 s my style and everyone can have their own style  \u201d he reply not miss a beat and sound like he really believe his own word  \u201c See  You \u2019 re great  That \u2019 s what you would say  \u201d I encourage him  \u201c It \u2019 s hard when it \u2019 s really happen  \u201d he say look down  I couldn \u2019 t argue with that  I offer to go get him a new lunchbox  He didn \u2019 t want to  He like his pink lunchbox  But  the next day he take his lunch in a brown paper bag  And  he have everyday since  That be Tuesday  Day One  On Wednesday  Chase come home and say that he need to talk to me privately  \u201c A kid in my class make a racist remark at the lunch table and I tell him that it wasn \u2019 t very nice  especially since there be a person of color at the table  Then the same kid use the word \u2018 gay \u2019 in the bad way and I tell him not to do that because it \u2019 s rude and because my uncle be gay and my brother be gender nonconforming  He say that be gay be sick and bad and wrong  He say that I \u2019 m not a good Christian if I like gay people  It \u2019 s all really be bother me  \u201d Chase say  He star at me  I star back at him  try to keep my immediate reaction from fly out of my mouth  \u201c Wow  Okay  So that all happen  \u201d I say a he continue to stare at me  I swear  I can not get away from gender and sexuality issue  Even when I \u2019 m just try to hide in my house and stare at three screen simultaneously  my kid be out in the world experience thing that aren \u2019 t okay  \u201c Well  baby  above all else  God say to love others and not judge  so you should tell that kid to focus on that  Besides  he make a big assumption that everybody be the same religion  Then  maybe you two should agree to disagree  Not all kid your age have the same opinion and worldviews a you do  A lot of them don \u2019 t know about the struggle for LGBTQ equality yet  I bet that kid have never even meet a gay person  You \u2019 re a little more worldly in that regard \u201d I be make it all up a I go along  On Thursday  pretty much the exact same conversation take place at lunchtime with two other kid join in to tell Chase that be gay be sick  bad  wrong and gross and against God  Jesus and the Bible  They say that we be a bad family  I email the teacher and principal  Then  on Friday  CJ  get be upset that a girl from his class tell him that his backpack be for girl  \u201c I tell her that it wasn \u2019 t  that backpack be for everybody and that be just my style \u201d He be proud of himself  He be smile  \u201c What do she say  \u201d \u201c She say I be a liar and that it \u2019 s only for girl and I can \u2019 t carry it \u201d \u201c Backpacks be for anyone who have a back and need a pack  \u201d I say  shake my head in pure exhaustion  The first four day of school  My young be afraid of get tease at lunch  while my old be actually get tease at lunch  I \u2019 ve already have to be in contact with two principal  two teacher and one vice principal  We \u2019 ve already be call a bad family  And  I \u2019 m still not catch up on my reality television show  This should be an interesting school year  ", "feedtitle": "Page 16 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
