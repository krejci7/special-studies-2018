\u2019 s also our month in review for October from Instagram   I plan to add to this post each Halloween because I \u2019 ve heard from people that it \u2019 s helpful to read a they get their own gender expansive trickortreaters prepped for the holiday  2007 Little Halloween CJ  Nearly nine month old  At the time  we have no idea that his gender expression would be feminine  Luckily  a monkey with a banana on it head be pretty gender neutral  So when he look back at picture  CJ doesn \u2019 t mind this one like he do others  It irk him  sometimes a lot and sometimes a little  when he see a picture of himself a a baby or toddler look masculine  Because that \u2019 s not who he be  but we didn \u2019 t know that until he be old enough to let u know through action and  then  word  2008 Little Halloween CJ and Chase  CJ be 21 month old and still not show or tell u that he be gender nonconforming  I dress him up a Robin Hood because  1  My friend \u2019 s son have use the costume the year before and hand me down be free  2  Red head look great in green  especially when they have little curl that poke out the bottom of their hat  3  He could wear his cute moccasin with the costume  which I fail to take a picture of   4  I have no idea he \u2019 d rather dress up a Maid Marian  We still have more than a year to start figure that out  2009 Little Halloween CJ visit Matt at work  He be two year old and I dress him a a police officer so he could be twinsies with his daddy  He love it  CJ be just start to show sign of be gender nonconforming but we weren \u2019 t pick up on them  Pics from that day be the first we have of CJ hold doll  They be little Halloween doll and he have them in his hand all the way until Christmas  2010 Little Halloween CJ be three here  Between the last Halloween and this one  CJ be show u that he be gender nonconforming  We just be struggle with it and hop it be just a phase  He want to be Snow White for Halloween  I stutter and stammer for an excuse not to let my son dress up a a girl and leave the house for the entire neighborhood to see  To u  that felt like take the whole \u201c like girl stuff \u201d thing too far  like we \u2019 d be parade our son around and ask for problem  That be a line we weren \u2019 t ready to cross  I spend week work on a costume for CJ that be a compromise  I get to the bottom of what he want most out of a costume  which be to wear makeup and fabric that felt nice  I sit him on my lap in front of the computer and go to a popular website for Halloween costume  I click on the \u201c Boys \u2019 Costumes \u201d section of the site and trick him into think that those costume be his only option  I felt guilty about it  But it also felt like something that I have to do to protect both of my boy from what other people might think and say and to keep the holiday as dramafree a possible  We end up settle on a black satiny polyesterblend skeleton costume with a face full of black and white makeup  It wasn \u2019 t the costume he want  luckily eat candy help sad feeling  2011 Little Halloween CJ be four here  And FINALLY in a costume of his choosing  As Halloween approach that year  I grow scar  know he be go to want to dress up in a \u201c girl \u2019 costume \u201d He \u2019 d be talk about it for month  Striking a compromise like we have the year before with the polyester skeleton and face paint wasn \u2019 t go to happen  I take CJ to the costume store to select his Halloween attire  Matt and I agree that whatever he choose to be  he have to have a wig  That felt safer to u  We both felt like we could really hide  I mean \u201c protect \u201d  our child under a wig  A wig felt like armor  We wander eight aisle of option  boy \u2019  girl \u2019 and gender neutral  CJ be not interested in any of the \u201c boy \u201d costume  except for the moment he spend inspect the sizeextrasmall Jesus getup  because  after all  it do have a dress and long hair  He inform me loudly that Jesus \u2019 s sandal be ugly  and I tell him that it \u2019 s not nice to judge Jesus or his footwear and that the option be limit in those day  Then he saw it and our decisionmaking process be over  there be no go back  It be a costume that he have mention a few time  It be Frankie Stein from the Monster High line of toy by Mattel  She be 15 and the daughter of Frankenstein  She \u2019 s supersassy and likes\u2014according to her online bio\u2014shopping for \u201c scary cute clothes that be absolutely to die for \u201d 2012 Little Halloween CJ at age five  He dress up a Bloom  a fairy from Winx Club  We \u2019 d come such a long way in our gender journey that we didn \u2019 t give it a second thought  we just buy the costume  No manipulative online browsing  No offhour trip to the costume store  No panic  No worry  No nothing  Just when we get to the point of not care about what other people might say  think or do about our boy wear a \u201c girl costume  \u201d CJ begin to care  When kid at school ask what he be go to be for Halloween he reply \u201c I don \u2019 t know yet \u201d It sadden me to think that the next year he might want a \u201c boy costume \u201d to avoid negativity  stare and judgment from other people  At that point  I didn \u2019 t want my boy to want a \u201c boy costume \u201d 2013 Little sixyearold Halloween CJ decide to be Tim Burton \u2019 s Alice In Wonderland  CJ be just begin to find comfort and a sense of camaraderie in the dark  quirky fantasy world create by Tim Burton \u2014 worlds where be different be celebrate  CJ be different  He want to be celebrate  As part of the costume  CJ wear a long blonde wig and makeup  When I look at the picture of him in his costume  it catch me off guard to see what a beautiful girl my son be  He look effortless  happy and confident  All the thing I want him to be  2014 Little Halloween CJ at age seven  When the kid at school ask what he be go to be for Halloween  he tell them he be go to be a lawyer  I smile  My son be spin the truth  I \u2019 m in PR  I know good spin when I see it  Yes  in very general term CJ be go trickortreating a a lawyer  More specifically  he would be dress a Reese Witherspoon \u2019 s lawyer character Elle Woods from the movie Legally Blonde  I \u2019 m sure everyone picture him in a little suit and tie with a briefcase and  maybe  faux spectacle \u2013 not a pink velvet peplum skirt  white fishnet glove  lap dog and crown  But  just a there be lot of version of be a boy  there be lot of version of be a lawyer  2015 Little Halloween CJ be eight year old and maturing  The month lead up to Halloween  he \u2019 d be draw to midcentury design  vintage pinup fashion and 1950 \u2019 s culture  So  when he saw a 1950 \u2019 s car hop girl costume  his annual outfit hunt quickly end  Of course  because CJ use his creativity and love for all thing creepy and quirky whenever he can  his waitress have a backstory  She be murder with a pair of pink fuzzy dice while deliver an order  Cue the posthumous makeup  Life with a child like ours \u2014 who society deems odd  weird and different \u2014 be magical and fun  When you aren \u2019 t blind by worry and the fear of shame  your unique kiddo can amaze you with their creativity  courage and commitment to be totally authentic  2016 Notsolittle Halloween CJ be nine last year  Shortly after I write that he would be dress up a Bob The Drag Queen  the season eight winner of RuPaul \u2019 s Drag Race  for Halloween  Bob contact me  I just about die  I couldn \u2019 t wait to tell CJ that his hero want to talk to me  But  Bob tell me not to tell CJ because \u2013 wait for it \u2013 he want to try to surprise CJ by show up to trickortreat with him on Halloween night  The only thing Bob ask be that he get to see the look of surprise on CJ \u2019 s face  I \u2019 m a realist  What be the chance that Bob would actually fly into town for Halloween  Especially after a huge appearance and video launch that rag until 3 be the morning of  In New York  No way it would work out  but the offer be beyond sweet  I decide that when meet CJ in person fell through  I \u2019 d get up the nerve to ask Bob to send CJ a video wish him a happy Halloween  What \u2019 s the bad that could happen  I never have to find out  because the bad didn \u2019 t happen  The best happen  Bob work until the early morning on Halloween  hop on a flight from NYC to LAX and knock on the door to surprise CJ and go trickortreating with him  It be the best night of CJ \u2019 s short life and  for sure  the best Halloween he will ever have  2017 Halloween CJ be 10 this year and decide to dress up a a dead drag queen  Over the course of his life  Halloween have go from a fun holiday for dress up to a time fill with anxiety and confusion a we struggle with his gender identity and expression to one of our favorite holiday because it \u2019 s a good reason for CJ to unleash his creative side  For example  here \u2019 s how his drag queen die  \u201c Well   click of the tongue and eye roll  Gurl   flick of the wrist  She be headline at a BIG drag show and one of the other drag queen didn \u2019 t show up for her shift   disgusted eye roll  So she have to work overtime and do extra number  When she get do with her show it be so late that she be too tired to drive her car home  And she didn \u2019 t want to take a taxi or uber  So she decide to walk home  She be cross the street when \u2014 BAM  \u2014 she get run over by a car  \u201d ", "feedtitle": "Raising My Rainbow"}
