selfedits more than ever in the first week of school  He try not to stand out a he get his bearing  He doesn \u2019 t wear his sock from the \u201c pink section \u201d He doesn \u2019 t wear his jewelry and accessory  He doesn \u2019 t take his pink lunchbox with heart on it  And  just like that  October arrive  That \u2019 s when my son can no longer dull his sparkle  Last year it happen on National Coming Out Day  I shit you not  \u201c I do it  \u201d he say a he be get in the car after school  \u201c You do what  \u201d I ask  Not at all sure what the answer might be  \u201c I tell my friend that I like girl stuff  \u201d he say  \u201c What do they say  \u201d \u201c They say that they already know and then they run to the slide to play \u201d This year  CJ  be select to be Star of the Week the week of National Coming Out Day  When you \u2019 re Star of the Week  the whole week be about you  In kindergarten  CJ  hat be Star of the Week because he didn \u2019 t want the focus to be on him  he didn \u2019 t want to share himself with the whole class because he be afraid of what some of them might say  Being Star of the Week be hard when you \u2019 re a rainbow  First Grade CJ  be relieve to be Star of the Week  He want to use it a the chance to come out to his classmate a a boy who like girl stuff and boy stuff  The last three word of his claim aren \u2019 t truthful  CJ  do not like \u201c boy stuff \u201d None of it  I struggle to think of something characteristically \u201c masculine \u201d that he do like  I would have to offer up that he like rid his bike  which be Monster High theme  and do gymnastics  which isn \u2019 t typically perceive a the most masculine sport  but it \u2019 s the only sport that my son will do   He also like laugh at fart and make up rhyme and joke that include the word \u201c poop \u201d Is that behavior consider more \u201c masculine \u201d lean  But  if it make him feel well to tell the kid at school that he like girl stuff and boy stuff  that \u2019 s absolutely fine with me  Monday  Star Of The Week Day 1  CJ  have to bring in an \u201c All About Me \u201d poster  We spend the weekend get his poster just right  He have very high standard  Favorite Animal  Turtle Favorite Food  Strawberries Favorite Color  Rainbow Favorite Place  Colorado When I grow up  I want to be a  Artist Favorite thing to do be  Play with my friend If I have one wish  I would wish for  I wish that people would understand me and not tease me because my style be different  I wish that color and toy and clothes could be for everyone \u2013 not \u201c just for boy \u201d and \u201c just for girls \u201d I like boy stuff and girl stuff  When he dictate his wish to me  I be a mix of sadness and pride  I be sad that his big wish be to be able to like what he want to like and be himself without the negative reaction and judgment of others  And  I be proud that he be brave enough to share all of that with his 28 classmate so that he wouldn \u2019 t have to selfedit a much while at school  \u201c What do the kid say about your wish  \u201d I ask after school  \u201c Some kid already know  Some kid didn \u2019 t say anything  Some kid laugh at me  But  those be the kid who laugh at everything  \u201d he reply matteroffactly  He be unfazed by the laugher  so I be too  Tuesday  Star Of The Week Day 2  CJ  have to share one of his most prized possession with the class  He be go to share one of his favorite book  Roland Humphrey Is Wearing A What   which be about a gender nonconforming boy who wear girl clothes to school and overcomes tease  Instead  he decide to earn some major playground cred and envious admirer by show off two autographed photo  One of the cast of Jessie and one of the cast of Sam  Cat  It work
