creative boy  I get wordy \u2013 a I tend to do \u2013 and the word count of my original essay be edit down  I get ask  a lot  for my advice and  so  I \u2019 m publishing my full essay here now  If you have advice  please leave a comment below  My young son be six year old and his life be divide into two part  before Barbie and after Barbie  During the first two and a half year of his life  CJ  be largely underwhelmed buy the clothes and toy pass down from his old brother  Nothing seem to excite him  until he discover a new Barbie in the back of my closet  He insist on open the box and playing with her  By his third birthday he could name every Disney Princess and her movie of origin  Shortly thereafter he start dress like a girl at home  When he be old enough to explain himself  he tell u that he be a boy who only like girl thing and want to be treat like a girl  I want information about raise a child like mine \u2013 a little boy who be a girl at heart  with a penchant for pink  sparkle and everything fabulous \u2013 but couldn \u2019 t find any  I search for blog  Nothing  I search popular parenting site  Nothing  I conduct countless  random Google search  Nothing  I complain about the lack of information to my friend  They all agree that I couldn \u2019 t possibly be the only person cybersearching and that I should start my own blog  After month of procrastination  I do it  RaisingMyRainbowcom go live in January 2011  My reader quickly educate me  they be the one who teach me that my son be gender nonconforming  That be back when I have no idea what I be do or what I be write about  Now that I know a little more  I try to help the people who contact me with question or concern about raise a child who shun traditional gender norm  Here be the thing that I most often tell them  Chill out and give it some time  My husband and I have be there  in that early  panic rush to figure out what be go on with our son and if he be go through a phase or if his behavior have some deep meaning  The only way to tell if something be a phase be to wait it out and patiently observe it  If the behavior go on for an extended period of time your child may be gender nonconforming  My son have definitely teach me patience  Search out resource and funnel your energy into get educate  Learn the distinct difference between sex  gender and sexuality  Sex be what \u2019 s in your underwear that determine if you be male or female  Gender be what \u2019 s in your brain that tell you if you be male or female  And sexuality be what \u2019 s in your heart that tell you who you be attract to  Read Diane Ehrensaft \u2019 s Gender Born  Gender Made and my book Raising My Rainbow  PFLAG and Gender Spectrum be amaze organization and resource for family like ours  Support be out there  I promise  Ask yourself some tough question and make decision  Is your job to love your child or change him  Is your child free to be who he be create to be  Is there room for shame in childhood  Who be you work to make feel comfortable  your child or everyone else  Will you be his first bully  This isn \u2019 t about you so don \u2019 t take it personal  According to Gender Spectrum  significant gender variance or a transgender identity occur in as many a one of every 500 birth \u2013 make it more common than childhood diabetes  A few month after CJ  find Barbie  I find the following quote  \u201c You have to go the way your blood beat  If you don \u2019 t live the only life you have  you win \u2019 t live some other life  you win \u2019 t live any life at all \u201d I want my son to live a life  I have to let him go the way his blood beat  Gather a stellar supporting cast  Like any family raise a child with special or unique need  you \u2019 ll benefit from help  We \u2019 d be lose without our family  friend  pediatrician  therapist and child advocate  Children like CJ  have the high rate of suicide attempt in the world and be much more likely to suffer from major depression  substance abuse and unsafe sexual behavior  To raise a healthy gender nonconforming child  it \u2019 s go to take more than one or two people  Don \u2019 t forget the sibling  Diane Ehrensaft recently say  \u201c It take a family to launch a gender nonconforming child  but that \u2019 s not necessarily what a sibling want to do or how they want to spend their time  Are we ask sibling to step outside their comfort zone andor do too much  \u201d Siblings have their own anxiety  confusion and vulnerability  They need empathy and support  too  Know your child \u2019 s right at school and know that their sibling be a protected as well  We always expect that CJ  would be bully and tease for his gender nonconformity  but we didn \u2019 t anticipate that his old brother would have to endure it first  The Human Rights Campaign \u2019 s Welcoming Schools program have a wealth of information  a do Gender Spectrum  Get yourself really familiar with Title IX and your state \u2019 s safe school law  Show your child example of other kid like him  We be lucky enough to be a part of a gender nonconforming playgroup  Every month or so  my son get to play with a group of boy just like him  Not everyone be that lucky  Before we have our playgroup  we read lot of book about kid who be gender nonconforming or different from the norm of society  Our favorite be The Boy Who Cried Fabulous  A Fire Engine for Ruthie and anything else by Leslea Newman  We also love My Princess Boy by Cheryl Kilodavis and Roland Humphrey be Wearing a What  by Eileen KiernanJohnson  Todd Parr book be great  too  Enjoy the path less traveled  You \u2019 re not weird  you \u2019 re different and if everybody be the same this world would be a very boring place  Paint nail  braid hair  tap dance  smile big  We watch everybody stress out to keep up with the Joneses a our son sketch a dress he want to sew for himself  Then he take a bath with strawberry scent soap and spritz himself with raspberryvanilla body spray before put on his nightgown  Diane Ehrensaft have say  \u201c Gender creative child be bless with the ability to hold on to the concept \u2014 that we all have one time in our life \u2014 that we be free to be anything we want \u2013 boy  girl  maybe both \u201d Or son continue to hold on to the concept and he have retaught it to u as well  ",
