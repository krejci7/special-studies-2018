school in his school district  In the letter  he explain that he doesn \u2019 t think they should segregate student by sexgender during PE class  He send a copy of the letter to his principal and teacher  His letter do not go unnoticed  One of his PE teacher reply say that they group kid by gender so that \u201c the girl will get a chance to play \u201d She say that \u201c if you put 5 boy and 5 girl on a field together the boy will never throw the ball to the girls \u201d I cringe while read her email  She do end it by say that CJ  could join whatever group he want to when the class be divide by sexgender during PE  He \u2019 d not previously be give that option  no kid have  as far a he could remember  CJ \u2019 s amaze teacher send him an email that he have read over and over  \u201c I be so proud of you  You be one of the brave kid I know  and I be so happy that you be in my class  No matter what happen  you speak up and communicate your feeling  and that be a HUGE deal  I

convey a great message  She tell CJ  that she forward it to her bos  our district \u2019 s director of Elementary Education  in hope that it would spark a conversation for all school \u2013 not just CJ \u2019 s  \u201c Thanks for be brave and for take the time to write such a poignant letter  I think that there be many adult who need to hear your message about equality and include everyone  I be proud of you   \u201d his principal write  The next day  the principal send an email let CJ  know that the district \u2019 s director of Elementary Education say that CJ  be \u201c absolutely correct  and that she be go to be work on get all PE teacher to understand \u201d How many kid have take a stand  write a letter  have the encouragement of their teacher and principal AND have the principal \u2019 s bos tell them that they be right  \u201c I be so proud of myself and happy  From now on  I \u2019 m go to stick up for myself and other kid even more  I think it be more important for my teacher to hear stuff from me instead of you  \u201d CJ  tell me  Rollerskating  Like I say in my last post  I \u2019 m so use to handle thing like this for CJ  I \u2019 m use to advocate for and protect him  I \u2019 m use to travel a few step ahead and try to make thing as right a possible for him  But  he \u2019 s old now  He \u2019 s strong now  I need to get out of his way  I can \u2019 t clear his trail  he need to blaze his own  Because his voice be more powerful than mine  A few day ago  I let CJ  read all of the social medium and blog comment in response to his letter  He be beyond happy to hear that some people be go to read the letter to their gender creative kid and share it with their school to spark consideration  conversation and  hopefully  some action  Here be some of his other favorite comment  \u201c This letter be amaze  I wish I have write it 30 year ago  Maybe that would have get me out of gymnastics and into wrestle like I \u2019 d want to do \u201d \u2014 K on Facebook \u201c Hey CJ I \u2019 m 35 now but fifth grade me want to say THANK YOU  I be the girl who want this same thing but lack the confidence you have to write this letter  Thank you  thank you for help make the world better for the next generation  You be one of my heroes \u201d \u2014 B on Facebook \u201c Great job  CJ  I raise a child who felt the same way  all through middle school  and I \u2019 m certain that he wasn \u2019 t alone  Thank you for speak up  for yourself  and for everyone else  You ARE make our world better  \u201d \u2014 C on my blog \u201c Every time in school I be in an allboys group for anything I be always scar and anxious because it mean possible humiliation or get hit  When girl be mixed in with boy there be a civilize vibe  I be never as anxious when the group be mixed and I could focus on the work at hand \u201d \u2014 S on my blog And  finally  some teacher let u now how they split up student without rely on sexgender  Here be our favorite tip  \u201c What a great letter  Tell CJ that a great way of split people evenly be to have them clasp their hand together naturally  Split by who have their left thumb on top and who have their right  It \u2019 s about a 5050 split of people \u201d \u2014 A on Facebook I can \u2019 t find our other favorite tip that be post  but it basically say that if your schoolclass use the Class Dojo app  which ours do   the teacher can use it to split up class in all sort of way  That sound like a great  easy feature  This week  during PE the class be not segregate by sexgender  The physical activity of the day be dance  All the kid dance together and laugh together  As it should be  Monkey bar  ", "feedtitle": "Raising My Rainbow"}
