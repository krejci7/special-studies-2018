who have find themselves in a parenting situation similar to mine  The family that reach out to me be most often look for camaraderie  resource  advice andor to be connect with other gender nonconforming family in their area  Recently  I \u2019 ve notice something else that these family have in common  the gender nonconforming child be adopt  Six out of the last eight family to have a parent contact me be raise a gender nonconforming child that be not biologically theirs  As I think back  before I start notice the trend and keep track  I can remember several other family who contact me and who \u2014 while share with me a little about their gender nonconforming child \u2014 mention that she be adopt  Do adoptive parent need more help a they raise a gender nonconforming child  Or  be they just more likely to seek out help  Am I not hear from biological parent raise their gender nonconforming child because they have it totally handle and don \u2019 t need a thing  I hadn \u2019 t mention this trend to anyone until I bring it up to a new mom friend of mine who I meet through the blog and who be raise an adopt gender nonconforming boy  She think about it for a while and then give the most beautiful possible explanation  She believe that the universe place adopt family together  Maybe the universe or some high power know that she would be a great mom for a gender nonconforming son and so it give her one  I nod my head in agreement  I know what she mean  I feel like the universe give me CJ  on purpose  I \u2019 m the best mother for him  I can feel it in my heart  I be mean to be CJ \u2019 s mother  We talk about it  And  she point out that most adoptive parent have to go through quite a lot to have a child  in most case it \u2019 s more of a process than biological parent have to go through  Maybe the intense longing to have a child  the legal process and the challenge that can go along with the adoption process ready a parent to be more accepting of absolutely whatever come their way  Are adoptive parent more accustomed to seek out help and resource  Because the child be not biologically theirs  can they better separate themselves from the child and the traditional expectation that go along with parent a child that be half theirs and half their partner \u2019 s  If so  do that good prepare them to avoid a mourn a process  see a challenge and address it  Adoptive parent have no idea what they be go to get  They start with no expectation because they don \u2019 t know what to expect  They know that the child isn \u2019 t go to be a minime  so be they more willing to let the child be who they be create to be \u2013 know that they sign up to deal with whatever they be give  Then  I notice another trend  More than half of the family who have contact me have mention that their gender nonconforming child be also a little behind in school  be at risk for repeat a grade level or have already repeat a school year  It feel like yet another special need family like ours must deal with  For CJ  for example  I feel like his slow academic progression can in part be attribute to his be focus on gender difference and worry about whether kid will notice his different gender presentation  When you be worried if other kid will notice and tease you about like girl stuff  learn addition and subtraction isn \u2019 t go to seem important  Learning uppercase and lowercase letter doesn \u2019 t feel like a survival skill  Blending in when need and honor your true self when safe to do so  do feel like survival skill  I can understand that  Also  if you \u2019 re a boy who like cradle a doll in the kitchen during free time in the classroom you seem a little young and immature  Five and sixyearold gender conform boy have mature and move past that  They have move on to throw sand at each other on the playground and tackle each other during game of fullcontact tag  For parent who be live with all of these thing \u2014 raise a child who be gender nonconforming  adopt and sixth month to two year academically behind their sameage peer \u2014 the challenge just seem to keep compounding  I have to believe it \u2019 s because the universe know what it be do  It give the unique challenge to parent who be strong  smart and love enough to handle them and never accept defeat  It \u2019 s not a scientific explanation  but it \u2019 s the one that make the most sense to me     Raising My Rainbow have be select a a finalist in the 2013 Parents Blog Awards in the category of \u201c Most Likely to Inspire You to Change
