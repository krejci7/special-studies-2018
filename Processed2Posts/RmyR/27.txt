post be write by CJ   age 10   If you aren \u2019 t catch up on Drag Race  it contain spoiler  All photo cred go to LogoTVcom  This season \u2019 s first episode wasn \u2019 t as good a the first episode from other season  It take me a little while to get super in to this season  But  now I be  Bam  Jaymes Mansfield On the first episode I like Jaymes Mansfield and Nina Bo \u2019 Nina Brown the best  Jaymes Mansfield because she come out with a puppet and Nina Bo \u2019 Nina Brown because her look be inspire by Mickey Mouse  But my favorite queen from the first episode be Lady Gaga  She wasn \u2019 t really a competitor  but she be still my favorite  I like it when Lady Gaga say that drag offer an escape  I think drag be a great escape  Sometimes I use drag to escape boring real life  In this episode Valentina and Sasha Velour be my mom \u2019 s favorite  Sometimes we don \u2019 t have the same favorite and that \u2019 s okay  RuPaul say no one be go home during the episode and I be like \u201c No one be go home  Then what \u2019 s the point of it   \u201d The best quote of the episode be when someone say \u201c the entire point of drag be to give the middle finger to rule of gender \u201d I say that the next day to my mom before school  She laugh and say it be true but I shouldn \u2019 t talk about give the middle finger  Especially at school  Nina Bo \u2019 Nina Brown I \u2019 m glad Nina Bo \u2019 Nina win the first episode  I think Mama Ru make the right choice  Then  at the end of the first episode they say some queen be come back and show the back of the queen \u2019 s head and I yell \u201c OMG  It \u2019 s Coco Montrese with her Dorito face  \u201d Every episode I look for a wedding ring on RuPaul \u2019 s finger because my mom tell me he get married  But I haven \u2019 t see a wedding ring yet  Where be Ru \u2019 s husband   RuPaul \u2019 s probably not wear a ring for the show but he be probably definitely wear it when he \u2019 s not on the show  I be not happy that Cynthia Lee Fontaine come back to the show on the second episode  I think it wasn \u2019 t fair that she be back at first  but now I \u2019 m glad she \u2019 s back because she have to leave the first time because she have cancer and she deserve a second chance  Everybody deserve a second chance  especially if you have cancer  There be a wax statue of RuPaul in the workroom and I want it more than anything  I would put it in my room  I also want a wall of fabric in my room  like they have in the workroom  But  my mom say we just redo my room recently and we aren \u2019 t go to do it again anytime soon  but I feel like that be such a long time ago  Kimora Blac In the second episode I realize how whiny Kimora Blac be  I think Peppermint be the best on the runway and she become one of my new overall favorite for a minute  Jaymes Mansfield have to sashay away and that be the right decision even though at the very first she be my favorite  Her personality wasn \u2019 t ready for Drag Race  She maybe should have wait a season or two  By the third episode  which be the most recent one you should watch   Valentina be my new official favorite  She be soooooooo good at eye makeup  In the episode Kimora say she didn \u2019 t know what an adjective be  By Kimora \u2019 s age you should know what an adjective be  By that age I \u2019 m go to know them in my sleep  Sasha Velour say \u201c we need to be proudly visible queer \u201d I tell my mom I like the sound of that quote and she ask me why but I couldn \u2019 t explain it  I can \u2019 t always explain how quote make me feel  On the runway Cynthia Lee Fontaine \u2019 s outfit look a little like a kindergarten craft  no offense  I like Farrah Moan \u2019 s seashell bra and lot of the queen have really great hair  Kimora be a no in my opinion  Nina Bo \u2019 Nina always do great at glue a mask to her face  But I have to admit her look scar me a little  I \u2019 m just a kid  Valentina Valentina \u2019 s look be my favorite  She remind me of a grow up drag Shirley Temple  Her eye makeup be always so good  So good  RuPaul make another good choice send Kimora Blac home  When she get home she should learn how to sew and not pay people to do it  And learn what adjective be  I can \u2019 t wait to watch the rest of the season and see who win  Right now I want Valentina or Nino Bo \u2019 Nina to win  Who do you want to win  ", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
