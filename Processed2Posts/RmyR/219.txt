family  When the ChickFilA antigay controversy break out during the summer  it be a nobrainer for CJ \u2019 s Dad and I to have a conversation with our son about the company \u2019 s belief and decide a a family that we weren \u2019 t go to eat there anymore  Our little family take a big stand and let it be know  Most people assume our antiChickFilA stance be base on our love and support of my gay brother  It \u2019 s a correct assumption  but a limited one  My husband  my son and I decide to boycott ChickFilA in love and support of the entire LGBTQ community and  more importantly  because in our house we believe that all people be create equal and deserve to be treat that way  To u  there be no excuse for hate and discrimination  not even the goto \u201c the bible tell me so \u201d explanation  Call u crazy  We also want to use the situation to teach a life lesson  sometime you have to sacrifice in order to stand up for what you believe in  ChickFilA have long be a favorite of CJ  and his Brother  They would miss the food for sure  Our kid agree with our decision  Our nineyearold son write a letter to ChickFilA president Dan Cathy  Our fiveyearold son  who be gender nonconforming  understand that ChickFilA isn \u2019 t nice to everybody  that they be mean to some people and that that be not okay  My husband and I make it quite clear to those close to u \u2014 especially those people who  on occasion  fee our kid when we be not around \u2014 that we would not be eat at ChickFilA  That be our decision  If someone we know didn \u2019 t make the same decision  we be disappoint but we didn \u2019 t unfriend them  We just ask them to get their fill of those homophobic nugget  sandwich and waffle fry when we weren \u2019 t around  Sometimes you have to agree to disagree  We \u2019 ve learn that sometimes that be easy say than do  Last week  a member of our family have a few moment alone with our old son and engage CJ \u2019 s Brother in a conversation about ChickFilA  which lead to the family member explain the biblical definition of marriage and what the bible say about homosexuality to our nineyearold  We  Were  Pissed  We felt like we have be purposefully betray and deceive  We felt like our son have be part of talk that be inappropriate because of our belief  his age  the topic and the family member \u2019 s knowledge that we be LGBTQ ally through and through  And  none of that take into account that our son \u2019 s beloved uncle be gay and his brother have a very high likelihood of be gay or transgender  Once we take a few day and few step back  we realize that we assume that people in our family \u2019 s life will behave a we expect them to  \u201c The easy way to get your expectation unmet be to fail to communicate those expectation to the person who be suppose to meet them  \u201d someone say to me recently  We have never clearly communicated how we expect the adult in our family \u2019 s live to conduct themselves around our child when it come to matter of religion and be LGBTQ  We sit down with the family member and  for the first time  say outloud what we expect of them and others  Initially  it felt weird to do it  But after we do it  it felt weird that we hadn \u2019 t do it earlier  We have never say outloud to the people in our life  1  Please do not talk about religion to our child  We believe that God be more about love  kindness and inclusiveness than he be about fear  hate and shame  We believe that he create each person perfectly and without flaw and that  more than anything  he want each person to be treat that way  And  if judgment be necessary for entrance into heaven  It \u2019 s God \u2019 s to give  not ours  Whether you agree with our religious view or not  let \u2019 s all play it safe and refrain from engage child in conversation mean to sway them  If you feel like it \u2019 s your call to spread the word of your God or your religion  please don \u2019 t spread it onto our child  2  If you have something unkind  at best  or hateful  at worst  to say about the LGBTQ community we have to insist that you do not say it around our child or u  We \u2019 ve end friendship for less and do realize that sometimes family tie be a little trickier to deal with  All that be say  anyone \u2013 family or not \u2013 who teach our child that their uncle and other LGBTQ people aren \u2019 t equal  be sinful and should be exclude from thing like civil right will be eliminate from our life  3  Because our child be gender nonconforming and have be for more than half of his life  statistically speak he have about a 75 percent chance of be a member of the LGBTQ community  When our family be around  please conduct yourself a if a member of the LGBTQ community be in your presence  4  Also  because of his gender nonconformity  compare to his peer he have a much high likelihood of attempt suicide  experience major depression  abuse substance  develop addiction and practice unsafe sex and behavior  We can lower the likelihood of all of those thing be in his life if we protect him from bully  Bullies aren \u2019 t just at school  all too often they be in the home  Our home and family have to be a safe  love and accept place for him  Always  If you can \u2019 t help create that kind of environment then you be probably help to destroy it \u2013 which mean you shouldn \u2019 t be a part of it at all  Thankfully  our family member listen to our expectation and agree to meet them in the future  We agree to forgive and try to move forward  We also agree that ChickFilA wasn \u2019 t what almost ruin our family \u2013 that family member \u2019 s action and our failure to communicate our expectation do     Would you allow someone with different religious belief to talk to your child about their belief and religion without you around  ", "feedtitle": "Page 22 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
