with rhythm and movement and love gymnastics  He especially hat  or hat  depend on the day  rid his bike  He \u2019 s more Paul Hamm than Lance Armstrong  dope or not   Last week we be outside rid bike with the neighbor boy  CJ  be new to rid his bike with training wheel and just recently agree to get on the thing without yell \u201c Too high  Too scary  \u201d in rapid succession until remove  The four boy be enjoy the freedom of the open road when CJ  crash  it be more of a tip  but we \u2019 ll call it a crash here for dramatic purpose   I run over to him and he lay  on his side in the same bikeriding position  hand on handlebar  foot on pedal  He do not try to break his fall  The thought  apparently  didn \u2019 t even cross his mind  I get him and his bike to the curb a the tear stop and he tell me that he need to lie down on the couch  Okay  easy enough  I lay him on the couch  turn on the TV  and go to check on his brother  A few minute later CJ  come out of the house with his right arm hanging lifeless at his side look like Bob Dole  I joke with my neighbor that for preschool the next day I would dress him in a suit and put a pen in his hand  An hour later we be at the hospital  And me  the wisecracker  be be tell that my son  Bob Dole Jr  have a dislocate elbow that need to be pop back into place  Jokes over I guess  Three hour of specialist  xray and CJ  strut his stuff around the hospital in his favorite Viking hat with long blonde braid and an unzipped hoodie  I couldn \u2019 t get his tshirt back on him after take it off to evaluate him at home   We get lot of stare  a usual  And  CJ \u2019 s brother \u2019 s irritability be increase  The combination of see his brother in pain  wait patiently in an uncomfortable chair for hour on end and people star at u be more than he could take  As we walk to the xray department  CJ  thrust his hip and head from side to side excessively to get his braid in full swing  He be wear a hospital gown because I couldn \u2019 t get him to take it off because it be  after all  a gown  A mom in the xray department wait room nudge her two child  point CJ  out to them and the whole family start laugh together  I saw red  I look down and CJ \u2019 s Brother be give them an evil look that I didn \u2019 t know he have in him  They didn \u2019 t even notice  We sit down  \u201c Those people be point and laugh at CJ  \u201d he say a he go back to play his Nintendo DS  \u201c He \u2019 s so embarrassing sometimes \u201d \u201c Today isn \u2019 t a good day for u  \u201d I say honestly  \u201c But what be bad  CJ  be himself or those people be rude  \u201d \u201c Both  \u201d he mumble without look up  I be think about how I usually try so hard to balance the want and feeling of my two very different child but that be hard to do with one in pain and need some extra attention  The xray technician call CJ \u2019 s name  May you never have to hold your child a they pop one of hisher dislocate bone back into it socket  They give him an ibuprofen  I need something stronger  After the cute  I mean qualified  doctor get the bone  s  back into place  he need to test the range of motion  He grab a handful of superhero sticker and hold them at different height for CJ  to grab  CJ  be not about to exert effort for a superhero sticker  \u201c He doesn \u2019 t like superheroes  \u201d I say  The doctor get up to leave the room in search of different sticker  \u201c Get girl sticker  \u201d I shout after him  \u201c Who \u2019 s he go to give them to  \u201d he ask a he turn back to me  like I think that now be a good time to collect free sticker for the girl in our life  \u201c He like girl stuff  \u201d I say and motion for the doctor to continue out of the room to get the sticker  The next day I take CJ  to Target to get some med and splint supply  \u201c Can I get a toy  \u201d he ask  a he do every time he get into the red shopping cart  I usually say no  but  hell  this time the kid deserve a toy  After careful consideration  he select a pink satin cheerleader uniform with silver sequin and a pink and white pompom  If CJ \u2019 s brother thought that the blonde braid and hospital gown be embarrass  he might not want to come home from the second grade today  If you be to ask CJ  he might say that the cheerleader uniform be worth the dislocated elbow  He wear that uniform every minute that he be in the house for four day straight  Then it rip and fell apart  because 15 dollar happiness only last so long  ", "feedtitle": "Page 30 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
