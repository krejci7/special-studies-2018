meeting \u201d by my friend  I don \u2019 t mind them  Our amazing administrative assistant brings in a homemade coffee cake and our department of eight fun female and two token male go around the table and often get sidetrack with one of u share a story from the weekend such a walk into a new sex shop unknowingly because it have a fabulous window display  the affordability of massage treatment in Thailand and the current bath salt phenomenon that have u all afraid we will be eat by a person who be under the influence  Our fearless leader try to keep u on track  but it \u2019 s no easy task  As we go around the conference room report our various work in progress we get off topic  per the usual  and start talk about the guy who work on our floor in another division of the company who yell at himself  or some figment of his imagination  during the break he take in the back parking lot  Everybody laugh  I \u2019 ve never see him  I \u2019 m not fulltime  so I miss a lot of the good stuff  like employee appreciation breakfast  white elephant gift exchange and  apparently  solo tirade that be grow increasingly alarm  \u201c Oh  and what about the shehe   \u201d someone say  My heart get hot  I hold my breath  I know who they be talk about  I didn \u2019 t say anything  \u201c Oh my god  I know     A year or so ago \u201c it \u201d be use the woman \u2019 s restroom and wash \u201c her \u201d or \u201c his \u201d or \u201c whatever \u201d hand next to me  and the other day I saw \u201c it \u201d use the men \u2019 s room  I wonder if \u201c their \u201d bos know about that  \u201d a coworker say  \u201c What \u2019 s the deal with that   Did shehe get permission to switch bathroom  \u201d someone else ask  \u201c Ewwww  that be so wrong  Just pick one  man  be you a guy or a girl   \u201d say one of the men in our department  A coworker who know more about CJ  than most people look at me in alarmed sympathy  I felt like everyone in the room be talk about my son  I felt the need to speak up for the  what I \u2019 m educatedguessing to be  female to male transgender person down the hall  But part of me want to say nothing  It use to be easy to say nothing  now it \u2019 s not  I look at my grossedout coworker guy  At the last staff meeting  he show u picture of himself hold his newborn son  He have no idea if that sweet baby in his arm \u2019 gender and sex align  He could be hold a gender nonconforming child or a transgender or transsexual little be  He have no idea what he could be in for  No new parent do  \u201c HE appear to be a female to male transgender person  \u201d I say  my heart racing a every eye turn to look at me  I \u2019 m usually lighthearted at work  the person to crack joke while work my as off  I \u2019 m serious about my work  but not my demeanor  I catch most of the people in the room off guard with my serious tone  \u201c What do that mean  \u201d someone ask  \u201c Transgender mean that a person \u2019 s sex  what \u2019 s in their pant  and their gender  what \u2019 s in their brain  don \u2019 t match up  It happen during the person \u2019 s creation  He be actually brave for transition from present a a female to present a a male  \u201d I say  Crickets  All eye on me  I \u2019 ve never be that serious with this group in my life  The grossedout coworker guy with the newborn give me a disgusted look  Then the person next up to report on their workload break the silence with a list of assignment  I want to leave the room  Maybe I shouldn \u2019 t have say anything  \u201c That be so awkward  \u201d I say to my CJloving department friend later in the day  \u201c I know  I \u2019 m sorry  \u201d she say sympathetically  \u201c It \u2019 s just hard  I feel like I have to educate people and stick up for people like CJ  I can \u2019 t just sit back  \u201d I say  \u201c I know \u201d Sometimes I feel safe in certain place  Like they be separate from my family life of gender issue  I felt that way at work  Few know about CJ \u2019 s creativeness with gender  Work be a place where I could let it all go the most  When my two world collide it felt overwhelm  I go home and tell CJ \u2019 s Dad about the staff meeting  It be still really bother me  My grossedout coworker guy with the newborn be still bother me  \u201c You know  you don \u2019 t always have to be an advocate  People say shit about gay and lesbian and trans people all the time at my work  I just have to ignore them because I \u2019 m not go to get into it  I \u2019 m not go to let them know about my son  They don \u2019 t deserve to  \u201d CJ \u2019 s Dad say  I can \u2019 t do that  I wish it be that easy  I never think I \u2019 d be an advocate for anything  It seem exhaust  Now I know that I be wrong and right  I be wrong  I would become an advocate  I be right  It be exhaust  ", "feedtitle": "Page 23 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
