spectacular  We be allow to ride bike on path all over the resort  I ride my bike so much  I saw my first alligator that wasn \u2019 t in a zoo  I go to the pool and play with my friend for a long time  I take tennis lesson and now I love tennis  On the last night  we have a nice dinner and I wear a dress  Then  I have a sleepover with my girl friend  I decide that when I grow up I \u2019 m go to make my own hotel resort  It will be mostly for drag queen  gender nonconforming people and transgender people  A lot of transgender and gender nonconforming people like me don \u2019 t feel comfortable go everywhere  At my hotel resort everybody will always feel comfortable and welcome no matter what  Straight people can go to my hotel resort if they be nice and don \u2019 t worry or even think twice about gender nonconforming and transgender people  If straight people think transgender and gender nonconforming people be just normal people they be welcome at my hotel resort  The straight people can dress however they want  too  The straight men can wear dress if they want and the lady can wear tuxedos   Just nothing inappropriate   Drag queen can wear lot of makeup and anything they want  Gender nonconforming and transgender people can go out in any gender identity they want and nobody will judge them  I promise  The number one rule at my hotel resort be \u201c you can never judge anyone for the color of their skin or the gender they be or the people they love \u201d I will have activity for everyone to do  There will be tennis  bocce ball  zip lining  craft and a big pool in the shape of a heart and it will be nice and warm  There will be two hot tub  There will also be a playground with gymnastics equipment  People will ride bike everywhere  They will also

that might cost too much money for our financial plan  The main hotel building will be a creamy white and the step lead up to it will say \u201c You Are Amazing \u201d That will be the first thing people see when they arrive  And they will believe it  There will be fancy people wear rainbow color for gay pride who open the front door for guest  Each night you can make s \u2019 more by a big fire pit and talk to people and make new friend  There will be shop all around my hotel resort  A wig shop  a dress shop  a shoe shop  a makeup shop and a craft store  There will be a gift shop that sell marble with glitter in them  There will be a theatre where drag queen put on show every night  A different drag queen will perform every night so the drag queen don \u2019 t get too tired  There will also be a kids fashion show every day  The kid can put on a show for their parent and guardian  if they want  But they don \u2019 t have to  it \u2019 s their choice  There will be plenty of restaurant to choose from  A place for hamburger  A fancy restaurant that serve oyster  And an Italian place that serve pink sauce noodle  red sauce noodle and butter noodle  There will also be a place for steak and chicken  Dessert be macaroon stack into a pyramid shape in a rainbow of color  There will be ink on each macaroon that tell the eater a message like  \u201c You be amaze   \u201d \u201c Don \u2019 t judge a book by it cover  \u201d and \u201c You can do anything  \u201d The hotel room will all have coffee maker in them with sugar cube \u2014 because sugar cube be extra fancy  Everybody will get a pair of white slipper  The towel will be fold into animal  like elephant  and room service will leave a chocolate mint on your pillow every night before bed  There will be a big bathtub in every room with bath salt that smell like vanilla and bath bomb that smell like lemon  When a kid arrive  they will get to choose a free gay pride rainbow flag  a small tiny plush star pillow or a pink heart pillow  That will be their free gift  They can only pick one  Everyone will always get along  I want everybody to feel luxurious while they be at my hotel resort  I want them to feel like a prince  princess  king or queen  Whichever one they want to feel like  it \u2019 s their choice  The people who work at my hotel resort will know everybody \u2019 s name and pronoun and talk to each guest like they know who they be  When people leave my hotel they will feel so welcome in the world and they will get all of their confidence  They will believe that they can do anything  When they go back to the real world and someone be be mean to them  they will not care because they will just be remember how they felt at my hotel resort  The only thing I don \u2019 t know about my hotel resort be the name  I can \u2019 t think of the perfect one  I need your help  Leave your idea for my hotel \u2019 s name in the comment below  I will pick a winner on Saturday  The winner will
