"The famous twirl brother of Orange County  I take the kid to the park to let them burn off some energy  CJ \u2019 s Brother be practice some of his Parkour meet Jackie Chan meet eightyearold white boy from The OC  move while CJ  play with a pink and yellow My Little Pony under one of the slide  Another boy run up to the playground and call out to CJ \u2019 s Brother  turn out they be in the same class and the boy \u2019 s name be Kyle  \u201c You \u2019 re brother be play with a girl toy   \u201d Kyle say to CJ \u2019 s Brother after a few minute  \u201c Yeah  I know  he \u2019 s gender nonconforming  \u201d CJ \u2019 s Brother say  state the fact and move on up the ladder to the tall slide  \u201c Oh  \u201d Kyle say follow CJ \u2019 s Brother up the ladder  He obviously didn \u2019 t understand what the term \u201c gender nonconforming \u201d meant  but it apparently explain why CJ  be play with a My Little Pony and  so  Kyle move on  That be that  Are we all just look for an explanation  Even if we don \u2019 t \u2019 understand it  I realize I have be hold my breath  partially to hear good and partially because I panic a little during situation like that  They be situation that we find ourselves in regularly and that have the potential of go all sort of sideways  I resume my normal breathing pattern and take a moment to relish in the pride I be feel for have a kid as kickass a CJ \u2019 s Brother  who accept  defends and protect his girly little brother  I like that lately there be no shame in CJ \u2019 s Brother \u2019 s life  no fear  no hesitation  It wasn \u2019 t always that way  For about a year  CJ \u2019 s Brother struggle with CJ \u2019 s gender nonconformity  He \u2019 d say thing like \u201c why do CJ  always have to play with girl toy  \u201d and \u201c why can \u2019 t CJ  be more like a boy  \u201d The whole thing trouble him and he be struggle  Then  one day after his eighth birthday  we sit him down and tell him that there be a name for kid like CJ  They be gender nonconforming  They be boy who like girl stuff and girl who like boy stuff  It seem to lift a big confusing weight off of CJ \u2019 s Brother \u2019 s shoulder  It free up some space in his brain and heart  There be a reason for CJ  be the way he be  There be a name for it  It make sense  Pink handbag  Check  Mini Cart  Check  Canned veggie  Yuck  When something have a name it change thing  Especially when the name be big and long and official sounding  like \u201c gender nonconforming  Not all family be a lucky when it come to kid deal with a gender creative sibling  We lucked out  CJ  absolutely could not have get a good big brother  We remind them constantly that they be the very best of brother  The bright star align when they be place together  So  it hit me that day at the park  when something be out in the open  when the mystery be go  when it be a known fact and have a name  do the power shift back into the hand of the rightful owner  Because  for a moment  Kyle seemingly have the power  He saw a child do something \u201c different \u201d and alert others for the sake of amusement and attention  He think  foolishly  that he be the first to ever do so  Oh  no my friend  we \u2019 ve be live this for half of CJ \u2019 s life  Two and a half year of people \u2013 mostly kid \u2014 laugh at CJ \u2019 s defiance of traditional gender norm and point it out to others with less than positive intention  But  when CJ \u2019 s Brother didn \u2019 t react the way Kyle expect  when he give CJ \u2019 s behavior a legit name and  then  not a second thought  the power shift back into our favor  When we unabashedly own our difference we shed our weakness and cloak ourselves in power  It feel damn good  We wear power well  if I do say so myself  I go to my regular PFLAG meeting last night  How time have change  When I first start go to PFLAG a decade ago in support of my brother  I be the young by far  I be in my early to mid twenty  no need to get specific   Now  my PFLAG family include junior high and high school student who have to fit the meeting in between homework  athletic practice  tutor  dinner and bedtime  There be brave kid sit in our circle who come out to their family at age 11  12 and 13  after know since early elementary school that they be gay  CJ  s ballerina  cowboy  pimp hat look  Most of these kid and others who I have meet outside of PFLAG decide to be out at school to shift the power back in their favor  Secrets give power to the person hold the \u201c truth \u201d who could possibly expose it  The powerless be the people who the secret belongs to  the person who be scar to death  sometimes quite literally  of their secret be expose  The bully  predator  hater and gossip in life move in circle  they sniff out the small scent of fear and strike  When there be no fear  no secret to sniff out and uncover  those people lose their power  The power go to the rightful owner  ", "feedtitle": "Page
