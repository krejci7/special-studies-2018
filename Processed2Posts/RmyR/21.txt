Lesl\u00e9a Newman \u2019 s Sparkle Boy be about a little boy who love thing that sparkle  shimmer and glitter  He \u2019 s a lot like my son CJ  I interview Lesl\u00e9a about her new book and her work over the last 35 year a an awardwinning  trailblazing author and advocate for the LGBTQ community  Lori Duron  I discover your work when my brother give my son your book The Boy Who Cried Fabulous  As a fabulous  gay uncle  he want his nephew to see character like him in literature  Little do we know that the book would resonate so much with my young son  CJ  who be fabulous and gender creative  After I start my blog  I reach out to you to say how much that book meant to u and our son  And I write a blog post about it  Lesl\u00e9a Newman  I so appreciate hearing from you  The Boy Who Cried Fabulous resonate with lot of people  include teacher and librarian who love the fact that it contain so many adjective  which be something I never think of  Duron  Shortly thereafter we discover A Fire Engine for Ruthie  about a little girl who like motorcycle and fire engine  I feel like that book doesn \u2019 t get enough attention  I mean  it come out 13 year ago and the protagonist be clearly more than a tomboy \u2014 she \u2019 s gender creative  Once again you be ahead of your time  What be the reaction to that book when it be first publish  Newman  As far a A Fire Engine for Ruthie go  I write that book a a direct response to Charlotte Zolotow \u2019 s classic  William \u2019 s Doll  The book do well when it first come out  but unfortunately it never go into paperback and be now out of print   Any taker out there   Tomboys of all age really like that book  Duron  And  now  all these year later  you give u Sparkle Boy  out June 15   Thank you for write this book  it \u2019 s so important that gender creative boy like my son see themselves in literature  What inspire you to write Sparkle Boy  Newman  I be inspire in part by your book  Raising My Rainbow  which I be move to tear by many  many time  I also learn a lot  especially about the different journey each family member take  in addition to the journey take by the person in the family who be gender creative  Jessie  the old sister of Casey  who be the \u201c sparkle boy \u201d in my book  start off in one place emotionally at the start of the story  and end somewhere else  I think this be very important  and show that everyone go through a process when someone in the family discover something about themselves  I be also inspire by attend Family Week  in Provincetown  MA  which be run by the Family Equality Council  I saw so many little boy wear tutus happily run around  fill with joy at be able to be themselves  One boy \u2019 s dad say to me  \u201c I wish my son could wear his tutu every day  not just in Provincetown during Family Week \u201d And I remember what you say in your book\u2014that your job a a parent be to make the world a safe place for your son to be himself  That be my intent with Sparkle Boy  to put forth a book that respect  accepts and celebrate everyone \u2019 s right to shine  Duron  You start write book that deal with LGBTQ issue and identity in the 1980s  long before there be LGBTQ shelf in popular bookstore and online bookseller  What be it like write about LGBTQ issue and advocate through write word back then  Newman  You know  I really didn \u2019 t think about it  When I come out  in 1982  my writing just explode  Previous to that time  I only write poetry and consider myself exclusively a poet  I have study with Allen Ginsberg and Anne Waldman at the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa Institute in Boulder  Colorado   But in the early 80  much to my surprise  I write a novel call Good Enough to Eat  I be hungry  pun intend   for book that feature a character like me  a Jewish lesbian  and couldn \u2019 t find any  so that \u2019 s why I write it  I write to explore the world inside me  the world outside of me and the relationship between the two  I follow up that novel with a short story collection call A Letter to Harvey Milk  Each of the nine story feature a different Jewish lesbian  And I be still write poetry  I didn \u2019 t write these book to make any kind of political statement  though I do think write a an out lesbian about lesbian character be a political act  I be just write story about my life and the life of the people in my community  I take the advice of Grace Paley  with whom I also study  who say  \u201c Write what you know you don \u2019 t know about what you know \u201d And then a lesbian who know I be a writer stop me on the street and say  \u201c There be no book that show a family like mine  Someone should write one \u201d And  thus  Heather Has Two Mommies be bear  Duron  Heather Has Two Mommies be a pioneering book  It be the first child \u2019 s book to portray a family of two lesbian mom and their child in a positive way  What be the reaction to the book when it be first publish  Newman  I have a lot of trouble get the book publish  No publisher would touch it  Finally  my good friend Tzivia Gover and I decide to put the book out ourselves under the auspex of In Other Words  which be her desk top publishing business at the time  We send out fundraise letter  before the internet  lick envelope and stamp   and raise about  4000 \u2014 mostly in  10 donation  Then we find an illustrator through the lesbian gravevine and print 4000 copy  I never think anyone except lesbian mom would be interested in the book  so I be surprise at the huge reaction it receive  Lesbian mother be thrill with the book  I hear about kid who get three copy for the holiday  who go to bed with the book tuck under their pillow every night  And I hear from people who be lessthanthrilled with the book and steal it from the library and refuse to return it  or return it with it page glue shut  Part of the book be read into the Congressional Record by Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire in an attempt to convince other representative to vote on a bill that would cut federal aid to school that in his word  \u201c carry out a program or activity that have either the purpose or effect of encourage or support homosexuality a a positive lifestyle alternative \u201d Duron  You \u2019 ve write more than 70 book and your work be pretty evenly divide in term of intend audience  About half be for an adult audience and half be for child  What be the pro and con of write for each audience  Newman  To me  it \u2019 s really all writing  What I try to do be let the content dictate the audience  child  middlegraders  teen  adult  and the form  poetry  prose  fiction  nonfiction   As long a I \u2019 m writing  I \u2019 m happy  The advantage to write a picture book  be that usually\u2014though not always\u2014it take less time to write than a chapter book or novel  The advantage to write a novel be that I always know what I be go to be work on when I return to my write notebook the next day  a oppose to start from scratch every time I finish something short such a a poem or a picture book   What I love about write for child be that a book such a Heather Has Two Mommies can really make a difference in a child \u2019 s life  So many family have tell me how important that book be to them because it be the first time their child saw a family just like their own between the cover of a book  That be extremely important and validate to a child  What I love about write for adult be that often I hear from reader who tell me how my work have touch their life  I never get tire of hear that  That \u2019 s what it \u2019 s all about  Duron  I think it \u2019 s important for people to know that you \u2019 re an amazing voice for the LGBTQ community through write word and the speaking that you do  but you \u2019 re also such an encouraging and nurturing mentor  You help emerge author and advocate  that \u2019 s something not a lot of establish author do  They don \u2019 t always want to help other people  Newman  I don \u2019 t really understand that  I firmly believe that when one of u succeed  all of u succeed  So many people have be kind to me along the way  my mentor  Allen Ginsberg and Grace Paley  the woman in my writer group  and so many others  too numerous to mention  The literary life be not an easy one  Authors need to stick by each other and support each other  I be always thrill when emerge writer I have mentor succeed  shout out to Newbery medalist Kwame Alexander author of The Crossover  and Leah Henderson whose first middle grade novel  One Shadow on the Wall have just be publish   Allen and Grace keep in touch with me for year  again  before the internet   always show an interest in my work and take me seriously a a writer  That be so important to me  I honor my mentor by pay it forward  Buy Sparkle Boy now  ", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
