girl toy and wear girl clothes  Don \u2019 t let him  Get your best Texas twang ready  because here be his word exactly  \u201c Direct your son in an unconfusing way  Don \u2019 t buy him Barbie dolls or girl \u2019 s clothes  You don \u2019 t want to do thing that seem to support the confusion at this stage of the game  Take the girl thing away  and buy him boy toy  Most importantly  support him in what he \u2019 s do  but not in the girl things \u201d \u2013 Dr Phil McGraw  I want to scream and cry and become defensive and find comfort in chocolate  You  CJ  need to stop playing with girl toy  1   \u201c Direct your son in an unconfusing way  Don \u2019 t buy him Barbie dolls or girl \u2019 s clothes \u201d Um  hi  if I take away all of CJ \u2019 s girl toy he would be nothing but confuse  There would be no \u201c unconfusing \u201d way to do it or to never buy him girl toy again  Children be not simpleton  CJ  would be confuse a to why mommy and daddy win \u2019 t let him play with the thing that he love to play with most  He would be confuse a to why he can \u2019 t play with girl toy  but girl can play with boy toy  He would be confuse a to why his big brother get to select his own toy  but he do not  To me it \u2019 s like say  what you like be not okay  And  that be not okay  CJ  would have every right to be confuse  I imagine that it would be like tell me that I should and could only enjoy hobby and thing that I hate  I could go to the supercross  but not the spa  Go to the auto part store  but not the mall  Study martial art  but not celebrity gossip  Drink beer  but not martinis  Furthermore  besides feeling of confusion  CJ  might experience feeling of rejection  abuse of power  extreme jealousy and inadequacy  I \u2019 m not willing to subject my son  either one  ever  to those feeling  According to Dr Phil  CJ  can no longer play with these  2   \u201c You don \u2019 t want to do thing that seem to support the confusion at this stage of the game  Take the girl thing away  and buy him boy toys \u201d Right  Take all of the girl toy away  I don \u2019 t even want to imagine what that would do to my child  Really  Dr Phil  Take away all of CJ \u2019 s girl toy  That would leave him with his brother \u2019 s old Thomas the Tank Engine train  a few crappy toy that accompany Happy Meals  a Nerf gun  a plastic cowboy and Indian set that Pa and Nana Grab Bags bring back from a trip to Dallas and a few other odds and end that he have no passion for  He play with none of these toy  but I keep them in his room  mixed in with his girl toy in case the mood to play with boy toy ever strike  It hasn \u2019 t  And  do the Woody doll from Toy Story count  Because it be a boy  but it be also a doll  What about his set of pink Legos  Legos be  for the most part  market to boys  but pink be a girl \u2019 s color and it come with a girl minifig and a tiny hairbrush for her and her horse to share  gross   What about his Scooby Doo character set  Should I toss Daphne and Velma and leave Scooby  Shaggy and Fred  Dr Phil really need to be more specific  Also  I \u2019 d like to know if he give the same advice to parent with little girl who want to play with car  baseball and super hero action figure  Would he tell a tomboy \u2019 s parent that their daughter might grow up to be too strong  too tough  too independent  too masculine  too\u2026not normal  not okay  Imaginative play be encourage in our house  No matter the character  no matter the gender  According to Dr Phil  CJ  be allow to play with these  3   \u201c Most importantly  support him in what he \u2019 s do  but not in the girl things \u201d Nice  Only support half of your child  you can support all of them if they fall in the range of \u201c normal \u201d I should support CJ \u2019 s brother because he be into video game  baseball  skateboard and fart joke  But  I shouldn \u2019 t support CJ  completely because he like doll  play beauty parlor  do girly sticker book and walk around in my high heel  Support him  but only half way  Let him know that only certain part of him be okay  To me this be the bad suggestion of the bunch  We all deserve to be celebrate all the way  Dr Phil go on to say that \u201c this be not a precursor to your son be gay  he \u2019 ll know that in time\u2026this be not an indication of his sexual orientation \u201d Another important Dr Phil quote  \u201c Homosexuality be not a learned behavior  A sexual orientation be inherit  you be wire that way \u201d So what do it matter if CJ  play with girl toy now if his sexual orientation already lay dormant inside of him wait to blossom in adolescence  What do it matter what a kid play with  That \u2019 s the answer I want  I want a reason  Dr Phil doesn \u2019 t want CJ  to play with girl toy  but why  Why not  He doesn \u2019 t say \u2014 and that be dangerous  I \u2019 m just suppose to take his word and follow his commandment because he say so  I \u2019 m not that kind of girl  And  I don \u2019 t understand why he tell guest \u201c Jessica and Thomas \u201d about their crossdressing toddler twin  \u201c Get over it  This isn \u2019 t a sex role identification thing  a gender issue or a gay issue \u201d How come toddler can crossdress and their parent need to get over it  but CJ  can \u2019 t play with girl toy and I need to take them all away  Dr Phil  in his late large article on parenting  advise parent  \u2013 Don \u2019 t fight individuality \u2013 Do embrace a child \u2019 s nuance \u2013 Don \u2019 t label the child \u2013 Don \u2019 t ignore an issue that matter to your child \u2013 Do empower \u2013 Don \u2019 t pick wrong battle \u2013 Do consider child \u2019 s desire Thanks Dr Phil  I \u2019 m do these thing  but I guess it doesn \u2019 t matter when your boy play with doll  ", "feedtitle": "Page 32 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
