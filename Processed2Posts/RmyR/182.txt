Brother     It \u2019 s CJ \u2019 s Brother \u2019 s birthday week  We start off celebrate his decade of awesomeness with a party at Dave and Buster \u2019 s \u2013 which I deem a total and complete stressfree success\u2026but  then again  I didn \u2019 t have to drive home five 10yearold boy who be hop up on sugar  hit each other with the inflatable hammer they win game and tell fart joke mingle with \u201c your mom \u201d insult  That be CJ \u2019 s Dad \u2019 s job  Monday we be recover from the party and prepping for the next day \u2019 s actual birthday  I be attempt to write a blog post on Monday night when someone send me a Huffington Post article write by Randi Zuckerberg  sister of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg  In the article  Zuckerberg question the choice of mother like me \u2013 mother who don \u2019 t hide their gender nonconforming son from the world  mother who don \u2019 t prod their gender nonconforming son to conform to make others feel more comfortable  mother who share with their friend through social medium the daily happening of their gender nonconforming son  who may happen to be wear a dress on the way to the grocery store or pink shoe on the way to school   Zuckerberg think that mother like me be do a disservice to our child and that we be do so without think about the consequence  If she only know how much I think about my child on a daily basis  \u201c We need to encourage our child to be individual and to explore their passion and talent  At the same time  we do have to acknowledge that we live in the real world  not a fantasy world  Your child be inevitably go to come into contact with other kid  who can be mean and cruel \u2014 be it possible that we do our child a disservice by not prepare them for the outside world  \u2026This might mean have a realistic discussion at a young age about why other child might not understand a young boy wear dress and high heel and why it \u2019 s in his best interest to limit that behavior for now  I \u2019 m not sure we \u2019 re do them a favor by just send them straight into the lion \u2019 s den without a warning about what \u2019 s in store  \u201d she write  She support her argument by quote parent guru and gender expert Kanye West  Someone may have be have an attitude because it wasn \u2019 t his birthday  The article get me so work up that I couldn \u2019 t focus on the blog post I have start  I turn off my laptop and spend the rest of the evening wrap CJ \u2019 s Brother \u2019 s birthday present while watch Real Housewives of Orange County and stuff leftover Easter candy into my mouth hole like it be go to expire the next day  I be get more and more agitated  I be exchange hurtangrysarcastic text with friend  fellow pink boy mom and blogger Kelly  I be prepare for a sleepless night when an email from one of my favorite writer friend and fierce mama land in my inbox  The Huffington Post \u2019 s Amelia be come to the defense of gender nonconforming mother everywhere \u2014 even though her gay son be gender conform  At a time when my word be unorganized and scramble  Amelia \u2019 s be clear  firm and perfect  Read her full rebuttal here  I think her entire post be a sample of Grade A badassery and I \u2019 m hugely thankful that she pen it  Here be my favorite chunk  \u201c Pink boys or gender nonconforming boy have be a popular topic of conversation these day  People who have genderconforming child  or no child at all  be always ready to put in their two cent about what they would do\u2026Until you be actually a parent in that situation  you don \u2019 t know what you would do\u2026 \u201d \u201c I be fortunate enough to call some of these mom my friend  Sarah Manley  Lori Duron and Kelly Byrom have not only stand by their child publicly but share the sheer beauty and joy of their child in word and photograph  I can say for certain that none of these woman take share lightly  They be well aware of what people think and what people say  but they have make the decision to put their family out there  not for notoriety but in an effort to help other parent who be go through the same thing  Every one of them have have uncomfortable conversation with a very young child about the asshole who make fun of them for be themselves  They don \u2019 t live in a bubble  They live in the real world  and they be try to make that world a good and safe place  not just for their kid but all kids \u201d \u201c \u2026 I stand strong with the mom who post about their gendernonconforming child  We be sister in the same fight  We be stand up and fight for our child \u2019 s right to be who they be  And we be fight homophobia  because \u2014 let \u2019 s be honest \u2014 that \u2019 s really what this be all about\u2026By not hide who our child be and by be proud of them  we be send them the message that they be perfect exactly the way they are \u201d \u201c \u2026I will not hide who my child be for the sake of others  because I will not teach my child to be ashamed of what make him the amazing little man whom it be my privilege and honor to parent  Yes  there be bully  but I will not be one of them \u201d CJ \u2019 s birthday present to his brother be this picture of the two of them  CJ  be the one in the skirt  Thank you  Amelia  for write this  And  thanks to you  Kelly and Sarah for always  always  always have my back and be there for me and my son  As Kelly have say  you mess with one of u  you mess with all of u  Thanks  lady  for inspire me  support me and be a group with which I can say the eff word much more than a good mother should  \ud83d\ude09 ", "feedtitle": "Page 19 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
