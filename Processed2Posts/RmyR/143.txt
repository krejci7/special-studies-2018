be potty train with nary an accident since exactly his third birthday  Last week  in his first grade classroom  he pee his pant  He sit in his urine until the dismissal bell rang  His pant be soak and cold when he get out of school  He be uncomfortable and he smell  He didn \u2019 t want anybody to know  It be his secret  He start cry in the car  \u201c I \u2019 m so ashamed of myself  \u201d he say over and over again  Tears roll down his face  even though he will them not to  He couldn \u2019 t hold them back  Come to find out  my son \u2014 with his long auburn hair  pink and purple fitted clothes  feminine backpack and wrist full of rainbowcolored loom bracelet \u2013 be terrify to use the boy \u2019 bathroom at school  On his first visit to the boy \u2019 bathroom  he head straight for the safety of the stall  Boys start peek through the crack in the stall to see if he be go pee or poop  Pooping at school be an embarrassment  He avoid the bathroom for as long a he could  The next time he have to go  he  again  walk straight to the stall  He lock the door behind him  He lift the toilet seat lid and unzip his pant  He could hear them talk  He could hear them look  He turn around  Boys be peek through crack again  This time they be try to see his genitals  They want to know if my son have a penis or a vagina  My son refuse to go into the boy \u2019 bathroom again  He have stop drink his juice box at lunch  He refuse to drink anything at breakfast  He \u2019 ll do anything to not have to use the boy \u2019 bathroom at school  He \u2019 ll do anything to avoid have stranger look at his private part while take bet a to what they \u2019 ll see when they get to see something  I \u2019 m sure you can understand why my son be not comfortable use the boy \u2019 restroom at school  He wouldn \u2019 t be comfortable use the girl \u2019 restroom either  Because he identify a male  the girl \u2019 bathroom doesn \u2019 t feel like the place for him  He want to use the boy \u2019 bathroom  it \u2019 s just that he want to feel safe once he cross the threshold into a domain that be loud  messy and run by the boy who dominate the playground  It \u2019 s a world where adult be not allow and one where be different or weak make you a target  We have a \u201c female campus  \u201d which mean that our principal and vice principal be female  I \u2019 m tell that it \u2019 s against the law for them to enter the boy \u2019 restroom  It \u2019 s the only place on campus where the kid have free reign  They know that adult can \u2019 t enter  It \u2019 s like Lord of the Flies in there  An island of urine  scream  voyeurism and soak wet paper towel throw onto the ceiling and hang down like dirty icicle  It \u2019 s aggressive  my son be not  My son have be give the option to use the nurse \u2019 s bathroom in the school \u2019 s front office  To a first grader at one of the large elementary school campus in Orange County  the nurse \u2019 s office feel like it \u2019 s mile away  When he do use that restroom  the other kid ask him why  He feel weird no matter where he pee  So  instead  he hold his bladder from 740 be  To 230 pm  except for on day like the other day  when he could hold it no longer  After get emotional and feeling blue about raise a boy who only like pink  I contact the school  I wipe my own tear and set out to fight his battle  clear his path and ensure that my son would be safe and comfortable at school  I feel like I \u2019 m the only mother who have to fight for her son \u2019 s right to toilet in privacy  without others try to get a good look at what \u2019 s between his leg  \u201c Of course you should talk to the school  \u201d my brother say  \u201c But  you need to teach him to stand up for himself if he doesn \u2019 t like what \u2019 s happen to him \u201d I have be operate in crisis mode  I have be so focused on handle the problem for him  that I be forget to teach him how to handle it on his own  We roleplayed  \u201c Stop look at my privates \u201d \u201c You \u2019 re be rude \u201d \u201c If you don \u2019 t stop  I \u2019 m go to tell \u201d \u201c How would you like it if someone be watch you go to the bathroom  \u201d \u201c Don \u2019 t be gross \u201d \u201c What you \u2019 re do be not okay \u201d \u201c STOP IT  \u201d It doesn \u2019 t feel like enough  It \u2019 s not enough  But at least now  my son know what to say to try to defend and protect himself  I talk to my mom about it  Weeks ago she leave her bible study in tear  A fellow churchgoing Christian claim to have insider information and know that my son be use the girl \u2019 bathroom at school  There would be hell to pay when \u201c everybody else \u201d find out about it  My son isn \u2019 t use the boy \u2019 bathroom  he \u2019 s not use the girl \u2019 bathroom  he \u2019 s hardly use a bathroom at all  I worry every day  Going to the bathroom should be the easy part of the school day  But  for my son it \u2019 s not  ", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
