6th grade graduation  and look like my Shihtzu \u2019 s twin   It \u2019 s endoftheschoolyear season around here  For middle school and high school student  that mean there be lot of event happen for which the youth be expect to look extra nice and fancy  Which also mean it \u2019 s a time when school send out special dress code base on stereotype of what male and female should wear  That stupid gender binary  Boy and girl  Pink and blue  You wear this and you wear that  For example  this week  an Orange County middle school send out the follow dress code for their 8th grade Promotion Ceremony  \u201c Appropriate dress for the promotion ceremony  GIRLS  Dress  skirt  blouse  andor nice pant  comfortable shoe  small platform heel or sandal  Modest strapless and spaghetti strap be allow for promotion  Appropriateness and reasonable modesty be the key here  BOYS  Nice pant  button shirt  polo shirt  closedin shoe  Cleanliness and proper grooming be the key focus for the boys \u201d Where do I begin  Let \u2019 s start with the law  According to federal law  student have the right to dress and present in a way that be consistent with their gender identity  so long a they follow rule for how to dress that apply to all student  This include how they dress at school every day as well a for dance  graduation  and other school event  According to our state \u2019 s  California  safe school law  student have the right to wear clothing that express their gender identity  If a school have a policy that say what boys and girl may wear to school or for special event  then the school must allow student to wear the clothing that correspond to their gender identity  It \u2019 s even good if school dress code be genderneutral and do not tell student what to wear base on stereotype about what some people think boy or girl should wear  Dress code like the one above be in violation of federal and state law state that clothing option must be the same for every student regardless of their gender identity and expression  Dress code need to be inclusive of transgender and gender nonconforming student  Take my gender nonconforming son for example  He roll his eye at polo  but love a good blouse  He would prefer a small feminine shoe rather than a masculine dress shoe  The kid have his own style and have the legal right to express it at school and school event  Me at 8th grade graduation  prove that it do get good  barely   Laws aside  the \u201c key focus \u201d list for each gender make me cringe  Assigning the adjective \u201c appropriate \u201d and \u201c modest \u201d to girls assumes that girls inevitably will want to be immodest and inappropriate  It \u2019 s exactly this kind of rhetoric that feed into a large culture of victim blaming in case of sexual assault  think of a college campus in the news   Telling boy that their \u201c key focus \u201d be cleanliness and proper grooming implies that they be usually dirty  smelly slobs  but hopefully they can pull it together and shower for this special event if they try their best   By specifically state that boys must be clean and well groom  the school implies that they either assume girl be naturally clean and groom or that it \u2019 s fine if girl be dirty and sloppy  as long a they aren \u2019 t dress in a way that distract the boy   These be unfortunate message for kid to hear  And  these dress code have lasting effect  A friend explain  \u201c I just want to share how trigger this dress code be for me and how surprised I be by this  I want to share because I think it give perspective on how damaging these type of thing can be  While I have no idea what a lesbian be when I be in middle school  I clearly know that I be different  I also be obviously a \u2018 tomboy \u2019 In middle school  I be a quite gifted musician for my age  and a such  be select to perform in an honor orchestra  This be excite  until the dress code for the concert be hand out  I didn \u2019 t participate in that concert  and there be other event I miss out on as well due to this  All through school  I love to sing  but never join choir because of the required gown that the girl have to wear  What surprise me be how this still resonate with me a a 52 year old woman \u201d This friend go on to have a career a a professional musician at the high level  include perform with the Los Angeles Philharmonic  It \u2019 s devastate to think that her middle school dress code have the potential to turn her off to music forever\u2026and that it could be do so to student musician right now  What be unlawful and imply dress code keep student from do  Playing in the orchestra  Attending graduation  Going to prom  Staying in school  Get it together dresscodewriting adult \u2013 or  at least  you know  abide by the law of your job   I write this post while ungroomed and dressed inappropriately just to prove a point and go against the key focus in this middle school dress code  The world do not end   ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
