doesn \u2019 t do well when group be divide by gender  I think she stop think I be a lunatic and start realize that I have a unique and  at time  tough parenting situation  As we wrap up our conversation  she thank me for tell her about CJ  I walk out smiling  discretely hold my arm out at the side  try to get my pit stain to dry  Three day later it be time for Ms Sensible to meet CJ  He
