bangle bracelet that cut off my circulation because I \u2019 m too lazy to make multiple trip to the car to unload  I bet Angelina doesn \u2019 t have to lug grocery  \u201c Why \u2019 s that  \u201d my husband say to me  which be what he say when he need further explanation to determine just how crazy my thought process be  Notice he didn \u2019 t have to ask who Brangelina be  Yes  I \u2019 ve train him well  He can proficiently discuss celebrity couple and know them all by their conjoined moniker  I peel the bag off of my arm  place them on the kitchen counter and pull out the Life  Style magazine that have just hit the newsstand  The cover headline scream \u201c Brad \u2019 s Fears for Shiloh  As Angelina cut Shiloh \u2019 s hair shorter than ever  Brad break down worry that his little girl will be ridiculed \u201d Legends of the Fall change my life  It be the first movie that CJ \u2019 s Dad and I saw together  which be a milestone worth journaling about back in high school  and it be when I be introduce to the one and only Brad Pitt  If you be attract to men  you remember when you first lay eye on Mr Pitt  It \u2019 s like how some people remember the day when President Kennedy be assassinate  Then  there be the first time I saw Angelina Jolie  The movie be Gia and  from that moment on  I understand fully and completely how a person could  with all of their be  be physically attract to a person of the same sexgender  The two of them together really isn \u2019 t fair  How can that much beauty and sex appeal cohabitate  Then again  how can it not  My relationship with Brangelina be shallow and purely physical for a long time  Sure  I hear that they do some volunteer work around the world  donate million of dollar to cause and save some orphan from icky circumstance and other fancy stuff like that  But  I didn \u2019 t bother myself with those detail until Brangelina have a little girl who start present herself a a little boy  Shiloh be roughly the same age a CJ  From what I can tell she be gender creative  From what I can tell Brangelina be okay with it  They be the first example of a family like ours that I saw and could relate too  If you aren \u2019 t a family like ours with a child like ours  then you have no idea how good it feel to read about and see a family that you can relate too  Having a gender creative child will never be in fashion  I don \u2019 t think that we be hipster because we have a gender creative child and I certainly don \u2019 t think Brangelina glamorize it  but they do make it seem a little more okay  at least they do for u  They \u2019 ve taught me to be  where CJ \u2019 s gender creativity be concern  totally unapologetic  I thank them for that  The article in Life  Style talk about how Shiloh go from like doll to dinosaurs when she be two year old  That \u2019 s the age when CJ  go from like train to Barbies  That \u2019 s the age when parent stop select toy and the child start do it for themselves  At age three  Shiloh start wear some clothes from her brother \u2019 closet and CJ  start wear my tank top a tank dress  A year later  when Shiloh beg for a shortcropped hairdo  CJ  want to grow his hair out like Rapunzel  Shiloh be sometimes mistake for a boy  because apparently some people don \u2019 t keep up on the Brangelina brood like I do  and CJ  be sometimes mistake for a girl  Our kid be total twinsies  only different  In the Life  Style article  Jonathan \u201c Manhattan \u2019 s most mediafriendly psychotherapist \u201d Alpert be quote a say  \u201c this be a culture where kid get pick on if they don \u2019 t look like other kid  Shiloh \u2019 s already different\u2026and she may already feel ostracized because of that \u201d People have give me the same advice and I have read it a few time in magazine like the Atlanta Parent  My argument be that if we be all the same  this world would super boring  If the goal be to get people like Shiloh and CJ  to be less colorful  the result will be a dull  drab future in a place where their peer have be teach that conformity reign supreme  It will be Boresville 90210  population snoozefest  A few day later Grandma and Grandpa Colorado be in town for doctor appointment and  like an AARPaged Bonnie and Clyde  they steal the waiting room copy of Star magazine to show u an article title \u201c Doctor \u2019 s Tell Brad and Angie  Let Shiloh be a boy  \u201d In the Star article Dr Jeff \u201c America \u2019 s Physiologist \u201d Gardere say that \u201c it \u2019 s important for Brad and Angelina to allow Shiloh to develop into any personality that be not harmful or antisocial  Therefore  if she want to develop emotionally more like a boy  then she should be allow to do so \u201d That \u2019 s what be hard for some people to understand about the way that we have come to parent  There be people who feel like we should be help CJ  to conform more and follow his instinct less  I win \u2019 t do it  I \u2019 m here to love him  not change him  He \u2019 s free to be who he be create to be \u2013 short of break the law and harm others  I \u2019 m try my hard to be what CJ  need so that he can grow into the very best version of himself  Though he \u2019 d probably rather playdate with Suri Cruise  I \u2019 d rather he find a BFF in Shiloh JoliePitt  Then  I could talk to Brangelina and thank them for be the first parent to show me that let a gender creative child be creative be okay\u2026while steal glance on the sly  ", "feedtitle": "Page 25 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
