 who be now a footballplaying high schooler  There we sit in the stand \u2013 CJ  sandwich between Matt and I Matt be good at watch football  CJ  and I be not  Matt yellcheers thing like \u201c Come on D  \u201d and \u201c Look for the hole  \u201d while I laugh at the sexual undertone  Then  he tell me to grow up  I don \u2019 t know what to yellcheer  So mostly I don \u2019 t  But every once in a while the urge come over me  Like  when one of our player get the ball and start run for a touchdown  \u201c RUN  \u201d I yellcheered when it happen at the last game  \u201c RUN  RUN  The player must have hear me yellcheering because  sure a shit  he keep run  I saw a player from the other team get dangerously close to him  \u201c DON \u2019 T GET HURT  \u201d I yellcheered even louder and with an extreme sense of urgency  Matt whip his head in my direction  \u201c Did you really just yell that  \u201d he ask  \u201c Yeah  I didn \u2019 t want him to get hurt \u201d Matt say that \u2019 s not a good thing to yellcheer during a football game  So I have to scratch that off my list of possible yellcheers  Our player didn \u2019 t get hurt  Instead  he get a touchdown and the stand go wild  as much a they do at freshman football game   \u201c Did we get a homerun   \u201d CJ  ask  Matt put his head in his hand  CJ  will never remember that football have touchdown and baseball have homeruns  CJ  fill some of his football spectating time read People magazine because it arrive in the mail on Thursdays and Chase \u2019 s game be on Thursdays \u2013 it \u2019 s like it \u2019 s mean to be  Last year  CJ \u2019 s teacher tell him that he need to read more nonfiction  People magazine be his preferred nonfiction read material  I make him watch the game whenever Chase be play  \u201c Chase be go in  \u201d I say and nudge him  \u201c What number be he  \u201d he ask  \u201c Number 59  \u201d I say   Three minute later   \u201c Chase be go in  \u201d I say and nudge him  \u201c What number be he  \u201d he ask  \u201c Number 59  \u201d I say  That go on all game long  Matt scoot a little further away from u  We \u2019 ve be to about five game so far and I always manage to yell something that I guess I \u2019 m not suppose to yell  Most recently it be \u201c RUN    \u201d follow by \u201c BE CAREFUL WITH HIS KNEES   THEY DON \u2019 T BEND THAT WAY    \u201d Then  a dad yellcheered \u201c IF THE QUARTERBACK CANT THROW THE BALL PUT HIM IN A CHEERLEADER UNIFORM AND LET HIM CHEER ON THE SIDELINES WITH THE GIRLS    \u201d CJ  and I look at Matt wideeyed and horrified  \u201c Oh  and he \u2019 s allow to yell that   \u201d I ask  I try not to sit by that dad now  The first few game  CJ  would watch the cheerleader flip and do acrobatics while say under his breath \u201c I can do that \u201d and the everhumble \u201c I can do that better \u201d In true CJstyle  he \u2019 s make friend with a handful of the cheerleader and be now convinced they be cheer specifically for his enjoyment  They call out for him by name when he arrive at the game  with the late People Magazine and an iced tea in hand   He sit and smile and wave at them a they do cheer and wiggle his body in a way that tell me he know the cheer routine and be hold back from do them along with the cheer team  I don \u2019 t think he can hold back for much long  When Chase first start play football during summer break a coworker ask me what position he play and my response be \u201c well\u2026he \u2019 s not the runner or the thrower \u201d I realize that I need to learn more about Chase \u2019 s new sport  Now  I know he play defensive tackle and offensive tackle  CJ \u2019 s hobby and passion be easy for me know about and be supportive of because they be typically thing I be or be currently draw to  I have to try a little harder with Chase  I like try  Chase be a source of constant wonder for me  I \u2019 ve never witness a cisgender straight boy grow into a man  He like thing that I know nothing about  which mean I get to learn along with him or have him teach me  All while mother him  guide him and worry about him every freak minute of every damn day  \u201c Did you see that play   \u201d Matt ask  \u201c No  I tell you  when Chase be play I have to laser focus in on his head to watch for traumatic brain injury  \u201d I say  Chase be still my little preemie baby  even though he \u2019 s taller than me and my head rest on his shoulder when he hug me  \u201c I like watch you play  \u201d I tell him  \u201c Thanks  Ma  I like have you there  \u201d he say  If only he know the embarrassing thing I yellcheer in the stand  Sit down in advance if you be go to tell me how awful high school football be  It be one of the activity Chase want to participate in and we support him in his passion the way we support CJ  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
