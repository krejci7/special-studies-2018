two troublemaker off to  \u201d CJ \u2019 s Dad ask a CJ  and I stride between him and his beloved flat screen on our way outside to squeeze in some scooter time before sunset  \u201c We \u2019 re go to ride our scooter  \u201d CJ  say over his shoulder a he continue out of the house  \u201c Dressed like that  \u201d CJ \u2019 s Dad ask me  CJ  have just be upstairs playing dress up while I be put laundry away  Earlier in the day he have be wear his \u201c Someday They \u2019 ll Make a Movie About Me \u201d shirt from Old Navy and swim trunk  Now  he be wear a pink tshirt dress with heart on it and a Monster High barrette in his hair  \u201c Honey Badger don \u2019 t care  \u201d I say to CJ \u2019 s Dad  It \u2019 s what we say to each other when we really mean that somebody doesn \u2019 t give an eff about something  \u201c People be go to think that he \u2019 s in trouble  \u201d CJ \u2019 s Dad say  \u201c Yeah  people be go to see him dress like a girl and that \u2019 s the first thought that will come to mind  \u201d I say in sarcasm and continue outside to mount my scooter  I secretly love rid a Razor scooter  it make me feel like such an extreme athlete  We use to prefer that CJ  not go out of the house if he be wear an article of girl \u2019 clothing  We \u2019 d gently steer him towards indoor play or have him put on something more appropriate for \u201c safety reasons \u201d We do so to save all of u from ridicule and judgment  I \u2019 ve also always have this weird belief that if a sexual predator be to be roam our street  a little boy dress a a little girl would tickle his fancy like no other  make our son the prime target for pedophile  These be the assumption that I develop in my head that make perfect sense to me  I assume that if a pedophile can score a seemingly confused gender nonconforming kid  they have some sort of brag right amongst their likeminded friend  These  of course  be all just assumption  I \u2019 ve never associate with pedophile  so I \u2019 ve never have anybody to either confirm or deny my allegation  We \u2019 ve become more lenient  CJ  doesn \u2019 t desire to wear frilly thing out of the house as much a he use to and our neighbor be use to see a fiery redheaded boy flit about in unusual costume  nappy wig and bare foot with pink toenail  CJ \u2019 s have strap on his red helmet and take off on his purple scooter  I be look for the black scooter that I usually ride  \u201c I just remember something  \u201d CJ \u2019 s Dad exclaim enter the garage from the house  \u201c What  \u201d I ask  move bike  ball and bubble around in an attempt to locate my scooter  \u201c Whenever CJ  play outside in girl clothes I \u2019 ve always worry that people will think that he be in trouble  I know now why I feel that way \u201d \u201c Why  \u201d I ask  stop my scooter search to listen to my husband  \u201c When I be a little I know this kid name Ben  When he get in trouble or do something wrong or do bad at baseball practice  when he get home his dad would make him put on his sister \u2019 s clothes and ride her bike up and down the neighborhood \u201d \u201c Are you eff kid me   \u201d I say  make sure that CJ  be out of earshot  \u201c No  one time in high school  Ben do something wrong and to punish him his dad make him put on his mom \u2019 s bra and panty and sit in a lawn chair in their front lawn \u201d \u201c Why have you never tell me this before   \u201d I say in shock  \u201c I don \u2019 t know  I never really think about it  but when I \u2019 ve see CJ  play out front in girl clothes I \u2019 ve always associate it with him be in trouble and be punish  I assume everybody be think that he do something wrong \u201d \u201c Oh  they be probably think lot of thing  but not that  What do you say to Ben about his father \u2019 s method of punishment  \u201d \u201c I tell him that it be weird and that my parent didn \u2019 t do that  \u201d CJ \u2019 s Dad say  \u201c What be wrong with people  That be so disturbing  \u201d I say locate the scooter  though now I didn \u2019 t feel like rid it  What if people think that CJ \u2019 s Dad and I be punish CJ  by make him wear girl clothes outside of the house  I watch my son a he hop off of his scooter  pick several daisy from our neighbor \u2019 s yard and hold them in his proud grip a he scoot to deliver them to me with a beam smile on his popsiclestained face  He didn \u2019 t look like he be be punish  I Googled Ben later that even to see what become of him  Ben be a professional athlete  If Ben mess up at sport now do his dad still make him put on girl clothes and parade around for all to see  I wonder  ", "feedtitle": "Page 24 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
