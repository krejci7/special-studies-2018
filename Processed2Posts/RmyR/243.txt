hour  I put myself to bed and think about question that I \u2019 m ask quite often  If I have a little girl  would I allow her to play with princess toy  read princess story and watch princess movie  Yes  Would I want her to aspire to be a princess  It depend on your definition of a princess  A princess who be helpless without the aid of a man  who have no ambition of her own and whose most important journey in life be find true love  No  A princess who be an educated dogooder who be treat kindly and a an equal by her partner who stand up for the cause dear to her heart and who have a killer blowout  Sure  Am I treat my fictitious daughter and my gender nonconforming son differently  If so  be that okay  Would I treat my child \u2019 s fantasy differently base on their gender  It \u2019 s something I ponder a I drift away to dreamland  ", "feedtitle": "Page 25 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
