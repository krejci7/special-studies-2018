to get the hard stuff off of your tootsies  \u201d he say give my foot a disgusted look  Rude  The pedicure pro get to work on our foot and a frenzy of chatter and laughter start  I be wish I be fluent in the language that they be speak so that I could eavesdrop when I hear the manager walk toward u shake her head in disapproval  The girl do my pedicure lightly smack my foot get my attention to ask me a question before the manager get much closer  \u201c Is that a boy or a girl  \u201d she ask  point at CJ  Luckily  he wasn \u2019 t really pay attention to anything other than his toe and couldn \u2019 t understand her broken English very well anyway  \u201c He \u2019 s a boy  \u201d I say  look at my son in his brother \u2019 s handmedowned blue athletic short and a blue shirt with a police car on the front  He be look surprisingly boyish if you ask me  But  then again  I \u2019 m use to see him in a skirt  heel  clipon earring and lipgloss  The embarrassed manager say she be sorry and divert her path towards the back of the salon  \u201c Oh  cause I think it be a girl  But  her and her thought it be a boy  And  her  her and her think it be a girl  We be take bet  \u201d my pedicurist say smiling and point to the other salon worker a she go along  She be amuse and I be shock  I lean over towards my foot and towards my nail girl so that she could hear me good  but CJ  couldn \u2019 t  \u201c Well  he \u2019 s a boy  so I guess her and her be the winner  \u201d I say with unamused tone and look  point to the two salon employee who have correctly guess that my son be a boy  None of them would make eye contact with me  CJ  be oblivious and I do everything in my power to keep it that way  Our pedicure be do and we walk out of the salon hold hand with toilet paper roll up and stick between our freshly polish toe  When I saw CJ  star at his toe and smile  I smile too  CJ \u2019 s first professional pedicure  He add tiny butterfly sticker  A few week of beg later  I take him to a different salon for a pedicure  He be select a color when his pedicurist approach him  \u201c You don \u2019 t want a color  \u201d she say  grab him gently by the shoulder and steer him away from the color and towards the pedicure chair  I stop her in her path  \u201c Colors be the best part of the pedicure  \u201d I say to her  \u201c Aren \u2019 t they  CJ   \u201d CJ  and I select our color  Then  CJ  veto the purplishgray color that I have pick for myself and pick another color for me  I end up with a CJapproved glittering violet and he choose neon pink for himself  We sit in our massive massage chair and the pedicure begin  I read a People Magazine while he play a fashion design game on my iPhone  The lady do his nail keep sneak a glance at the neon pink bottle of polish that he have select  She be say something to her coworker who be busy work on my foot  They be go back and forth and look at the neon pink  \u201c Little boy  you sure you want pink  Why not

\u2019 s second professional pedicure  I may never be able to get a pedicure alone again  She grant his wish  while talk even more excitedly with her coworker in the language that I didn \u2019 t know  Again  I wish for a moment that I be fluent in the secret language of pedicurists  Then  I decide that I \u2019 m glad that I couldn \u2019 t understand what they be say  Because I really don \u2019 t care  My son and I be happy  walk to our car with toilet paper worm between our purple and pink toe  walk on our heel with toe point up  like that would help the polish dry faster  hand in hand smiling  My son be happy and that \u2019 s all that really matter  ", "feedtitle": "Page 22 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
