author of this post be my very best friend KK  whom CJ  know affectionately a Auntie KK  I love CJ \u2019 s mom  She be my very best friend and my soul sister  We have be besties for more year than I care to say for fear of reveal our scandalously young age\u2026 Ha  KK \u2019 s kid and CJ \u2019 s Brother I also love CJ  and his brother a if they be my own  My husband and I have two child a well and they have all be raise together since birth  Brothers  sister  cousins\u2026they may not have these title officially  but they be family  We be family  As many family do  we have holiday tradition  nontraditions  random outing of all sort and this holiday season be no different  Our two clan come together just before Christmas at a local amusement park for some seasonal fun and the standard picture with Santa  CJ \u2019 s mom and I both agree to dress the kid in festive attire so that we would have ourselves a great picture for year to come  However  a I help my nineyearold daughter assemble her outfit for the day  I realize for the first time that I have reservation about her overly zealous use of accessory and thing that glitter  The fact be  we be go to be spend the entire day in public with CJ  He would not be in full CJ  regalia and I do not want to make him feel jealous or uncomfortable  I do not have to even explain it to my daughter  just the simple mention of who our party include be reason enough for her to tone it down  Even something inside of her knew  Our 2012 picture with Santa The day be crisp and the kid all look adorable in their layer  CJ  be wear his dark wash jean  holiday appropriate red henley and super cool black motorcycle jacket  The other three child be also dress in gendertypical chilly weather  holiday clothing  The day itself be a success  Us adult take turns rid different attraction with the kid a to not give any one parent total nausea from the spinning and jerk death trap  Once all the fun be have at the park we set out for a conjoined family dinner at the nearby Mexican restaurant to conclude the day  After dinner we go our separate way and call it a night  All thing consider it be a normal out enjoy by all  It wasn \u2019 t until the next day that I realize that  in fact  it be not a normal day at all  I could not immediately pinpoint it but there have be something off  The entire day have an air about it that be just wrong  After some more thought I decide to go back through my phone and look at the picture from the day  And there it was\u2026in color right before my eye  I be star at the picture of the kid with Santa  All of them be smile  look as cute a ever  And then there be CJ  smile  but also fight with himself  Holding his tiny little hand together  fight the urge to strike a fabulous pose and pop his hip just so\u2026 KK \u2019 s Daughter and CJ  have a fashion show You see  I have be a passenger on this journey with CJ \u2019 s Mom from the beginning but in many respect I be still an outsider look in  Our family be so blended that almost all of our outing  trip and week long vacation end with u in the comfort of one of our home  together  It be there that CJ  be able to be his true self  Either wrap in his own dress up clothes or in my daughter \u2019 s hand me down  this be CJ  It have be some time since we spend an entire day with \u201c public CJ \u201d only  And  a I star at the picture my heart break  My heart break for CJ  and for my best friend and for CJ \u2019 s Brother and Father  The trial and tribulation be just begin  Although I be witness to this day \u2019 s internal battle for CJ  they live with this day in and day out  CJ \u2019 s Mom and Dad will have to struggle every day with the public versus private CJ  How much of his true self do you allow him to show and still be able to protect him from the judgment of others  CJ \u2019 s brother have many of these hard day in front of his as well  How do he use his word \u2014 not his fist \u2014 to help the other child understand that CJ  be special because of his difference and not to be the subject of childhood torture  How do you balance a free and open spirit with a closeminded world  I can only imagine what it be to struggle with the big part of yourself every day  your heart  We all struggle each day with something  those pesky 10 pound  a bad hair day or the cranky bosstoddlerhusbandinsert noun here  But  to fight your true self each day at five year old  That be earth shatter  KK \u2019 s Daughter and CJ  in Colorado As much a my heart be break  it be also full of pride  I be proud of CJ  for not let the world quell his fire  He be not at a point in his life where he have to claim a stake into one side of the fence or the other  although some may expect it  But he be not allow the expect to totally define him  He be CJ\u2026gender nonconforming  My hope be that he win \u2019 t always have to struggle between the \u201c Public CJ \u201d and the \u201c Private CJ \u201d If the two could just come together  the world would see one amaze child  I would be remiss if I do not mention the overflow amount of pride I have in my very best friend  Not every parent be equip to handle a child that require more\u2026 more help  more understanding  more patience  However  CJ  know what he be do when he pick her a his mother  there truly would be no good fit  CJ \u2019 s mom be a remarkable woman and I be privilege to be her friend  A strong woman stand up for herself  but the strong woman stand up for others  You my friend be among the strong  I love you
