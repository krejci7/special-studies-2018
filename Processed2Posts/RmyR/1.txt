 He cry until a restless sleep find him  then he whimper rhythmically  If I move away  he move toward me so that our cheek be touch  He hadn \u2019 t slept in bed with me since he be six month old  He turn 11 on February 1  A week later  Allie  his \u201c school best friend \u201d break his heart  \u201c My family doesn \u2019 t hang out with gay people  so I \u2019 m not go to hang out with you anymore  \u201d she tell him a they walk together after school  CJ  didn \u2019 t say anything  He be in shock and confuse  The feeling of his heart breaking for the first time render him speechless  We \u2019 ve know Allie \u2019 s family casually for nine year  in the way you know a family when you raise child together in the suburb  CJ  have go to school with Allie for half his life  She \u2019 s always know that he \u2019 s a gender creative boy who like \u201c girl things \u201d It turn out  while Allie and her family have apparently be  at least somewhat  okay with CJ \u2019 s gender creativity  they aren \u2019 t okay if he \u2019 s gay  \u201c How be school  \u201d I ask CJ  when he get in the car that afternoon  \u201c Fine  \u201d he say  I could tell that nothing in his world be fine  We drive for a few minute in silence until his pain come pour out  It be too much for me to catch  \u201c She just say it  She say her family doesn \u2019 t hang out with gay people  so she can \u2019 t hang out with me  She say I \u2019 m the only gay person she know  and she doesn \u2019 t want to know me  She say that all of our friend will be her friend now because she be more popular than I be  \u201d he sob  with his head in hand  Tears drip out from between his little finger that be dirty from play handball on the blacktop  At this point in his life  CJ  doesn \u2019 t talk much about his sexual orientation  He \u2019 s not yet a romantic or sexual be  he \u2019 s an 11year old boy with lot of time to figure out who he be attract to while have our unconditional love and support  When he do talk about it  sometimes he say he \u2019 s gay  Sometimes he say he \u2019 s half gay and half bisexual  Sometimes he say  \u201c I \u2019 m just me  \u201d Whatever his future sexuality  that day homophobia turned my son into devastation personify  Like all LGBTQ and gender expansive people  CJ  have learn to live life ignore the stare  snicker and snide comment of stranger  He can brush off invasive question and critique quip from classmate with a certain amount of ease  But  face hostility from one of the most important people in his life \u2013 one of his best friend \u2013 be something he \u2019 d never have to deal with  It put a gash in his heart that may never heal completely  I focus on drive even though it be the last thing I want to do  I want to pull over and crawl into the back seat to comfort him  When we arrive home  Matt  my husband  be work in the garage and could tell right away that something be wrong  CJ  be all tear and unanswerable question  \u201c Are Allie \u2019 s parent homophobic  \u201d \u201c Do they hate gay people  \u201d \u201c Do they hate me  \u201d \u201c If people be friends with me  can they still be popular  \u201d \u201c Who will I sit with at lunch  \u201d \u201c Who will I play with at recess  \u201d \u201c Why do people hate people for something they can \u2019 t change  \u201d My gut reaction be the desire to lash out  I want to send Allie \u2019 s mom question text  I want to point out Allie \u2019 s flaw to CJ  and return the birthday present she hand him with a smile a few day earlier  I want to erase all the play date they \u2019 d have and the craft they \u2019 d make  I want to delete the picture they take with Santa at Christmas time  I know I wasn \u2019 t think rationally with my brain  I be feel with my heart  I remind myself of the lesson we teach both of our son  we can \u2019 t let hate breed hate  That \u2019 s easy say than do  CJ  doesn \u2019 t feel shame about like makeup or thinking boy be cute  Allie have see more of that this school year  A few month ago  she be the first person outside of our family who CJ  tell he might be gay  She be a little uncomfortable  but their friendship carry on  After the movie Wonder come out  they discover they both have a crush on the male costar  Allie think it be weird  but also totally understandable because the boy be so cute  I guess there have only be little hint of gay up until just before the big breakup  Then  Allie get in trouble when her parent catch her read my blog about raise a gender creative child on her iPad  Days later  she attend CJ \u2019 s birthday party and there be gay people among the partygoer  During the party  CJ  randomly tell her that he couldn \u2019 t wait for OC Pride  our local Pride  and that she should go because Pride be so much fun  Either Allie decide she be too uncomfortable with CJ \u2019 s nonheteronormative identity to be friend with him or her parent make the decision for her  because the next day their friendship be over \u2014 but CJ \u2019 s physical and emotional pain have just begin  He climb onto my lap like a small child  I hold him and rock him while thinking  \u201c This be what hate do  This be what the effect of bigotry look like  A mother rock her fifth grader because neither one know what to do to ease the pain \u201d We sit  share tear for nearly an hour with few word say  \u201c I love you so much \u201d I whisper over and over  \u201c I know  \u201d he whisper each time  \u201c If I could take away the pain  I would \u201d I say  \u201c I know  But you can \u2019 t take away the gay  \u201d he say  I wish Allie and her parent could witness that moment  Would it prompt them to reconsider their phobia  Would they change their mind  Would they see that my tendersouled boy be a great person to have in their life  Would they see that I \u2019 m teach my child to love while they \u2019 re teach their child to hate  CJ \u2019 s pain come in wave  like pain usually do  He \u2019 d forget for a moment  He \u2019 d tire for a minute  Then he \u2019 d remember  The emotion would crest and break  At time  CJ  be inconsolable  I watch him shiver on the couch and struggle to catch his breath between sob  This be one of the reason why some LGBTQ and gender expansive kid kill themselves  This be why some of them sink into depression  turn to drug  drop out of school and participate in unsafe sexual situation  This be why some mother with child like mine find their arm empty one day  I worry that CJ  can \u2019 t take this kind of pain and rejection for year on end  He can \u2019 t have night like this multiply by seven more year of school and an infinite number of classmate who will hate him for who he love and what he wear  We get him into the bath  tell him that a good soak would soothe him  Matt lay on the floor next to the bathtub so that CJ  would feel his presence and protection  Matt wipe away his own slow  silent tear when CJ  wasn \u2019 t look  \u201c You \u2019 re not go to be alone  buddy  You \u2019 re still go to have friend  \u201d Matt say before list all of CJ  friend \u2013 exclude Allie  Matt and I didn \u2019 t think Allie could persuade all of CJ \u2019 s friend to turn their back on him  Until now  all of his girl friend have always be fiercely loyal and protective  But  she \u2019 d plant a seed of fear in our heart we have never felt before  If Allie  who have once be one of CJ \u2019 s most loyal friend and protector  could change her view of him seemingly overnight  I worry it might be possible that others could do the same  I suddenly find myself spiral a I imagine Allie and her parent texting  email  facebooking  tweet  snapchatting and facetiming every family in the school directory to turn them against our son because he might love a boy one day  Gossip and hate spread fast in the suburb  I catch myself before the terrifying daydream could unravel any further  Rather than dwell on worstcase scenario  Matt and I decide to try to use the experience a a teachable moment  We remind CJ  to treat others the way he want to be treat and that the easy way to rob hater of their power be to act like their action don \u2019 t bother you  CJ  ask if we could just go to bed and wake up tomorrow  I agree without hesitation  Sleep be often the answer  His mention of the next day be a reminder that it would be the first day when he \u2019 d have no friend at school  sit by himself at lunch and play by himself at recess  He picture every day of the rest of his day be spent alone and hat  because Allie \u2019 s family doesn \u2019 t hang out with gay people  so Allie doesn \u2019 t  so no one else will  \u201c It win \u2019 t hurt this bad forever  It \u2019 s go to get good  I know that \u2019 s hard to believe right now  but I promise  \u201d I say to CJ  in bed  \u201c You have lot of friend  You be amaze and if people don \u2019 t see that  they be the one with the problem  not you  Kids should be line up to have a unique friend like you \u201d The next morning I drive CJ  to school slowly  in no hurry for him to leave the safety of my car  \u201c I love you  Have a good day  \u201d I say to him  a I do every morning  I watch him walk away from my car with his head hang low  It felt like my heart be walk off with him  I drive tearyeyed to work  think of the parent of rainbow who felt this pain before me and those who will feel it after me  I think of the LGBTQ and gender expansive youth who have or will experience CJ \u2019 s pain and rejection without unconditional love and support at home  When I arrive at work  I look in the rearview mirror and wipe my eye  I take a deep breath and walk into my office  ready to start the countdown to when I find out how CJ \u2019 s day at school go  Who would be friend with CJ   ", "feedtitle": "Raising My Rainbow"}
