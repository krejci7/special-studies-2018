phrase combo  try to fit a life dilemma into a search bar  Boys dress a girl for Halloween  My son want to be a princess for Halloween  Boys a Snow White  Boys a Disney Princesses  Should I let my threeyearold be Snow White for Halloween  Genderneutral Halloween costume  Not much turn up with those search term  I get search happy  Boys play with girl toy  Boys dress a girl  Boys like girl thing  What be the chance of an effeminate boy grow up to be gay  Little gay boy  I give up Google and move to parent site and mom blog  There weren \u2019 t section within the parenting sit that I visit or dedicate mom blog for people like me raise a child like mine  I desperately want to connect and get some answer  Nerdy Applebottom publish her infamous \u201c My Son be Gay \u201d post about her son be Daphne for Halloween  I get excite  Then she go back to write content more typical of a general mom blog  But  I want more about Boo  I felt like I be so close to find a mom and child and blog that I could relate to  Enough waiting and searching  I \u2019 d be that blogger I \u2019 d be look for  So  my Christmas gift to myself and 2011 New Year \u2019 s Resolution be to journal about the adventure in raise a slightly effeminate  possibly gay  totally fabulous son  As a new year launch  so do RaisingMyRainbowcom  I start RaisingMyRainbowcom for myself  To record my feeling and experience  like any blogger  but not to rant or stand on a cybersoapbox or be sensationalistic  I start it for any other person in a situation similar to mine  raise a gender nonconforming son  There have to be more of u out there  right  Right   We need support  to hear other people \u2019 s story and know that we aren \u2019 t alone  And  I start it in hop that I would draw the LBGTQ audience  because they be the one who have the answer to a lot of my question about raise a child like mine  Like  When do you know you be different  When do you know you be gay  Did you do this  Did you do that  How do your parent treat you  How do you wish they would have treat you  How do your peer treat you  What can I do for my son that you wish someone would have do for you  My audience wasn \u2019 t everybody  I understand that  I \u2019 ve heard from people who aren \u2019 t comfortable with my blog  But for every one email of opposition  I get about a dozen of support  When I start write I know I have an effeminate son  I didn \u2019 t know that I have a gender creative  gender nonconforming  gender variant son  I wasn \u2019 t hip to the lingo  A few week in I learn that  Although I know the difference between gender and sexuality  I have it reinforce by reader time and time again  I still do  I don \u2019 t mind  Have I consider that CJ  be transgender  Sure  I \u2019 ve consider it a lot actually  It \u2019 s hard to see a fouryearold boy in a cheerleader skirt wave pompom and not consider it  Go ahead  try  For now  he identify mostly a a boy  Early on  people start send me research  link to article and video that they think I \u2019 d find interesting and they start send mail to CJ  A dialogue start that span 45 country  As it happen  I realize something that I have never think about before  All over the world  there be family raise gender nonconforming kid  The next generation of the LGBTQ community be be raise  right now  And  you know u parent  the one raise that next generation of the LGBTQ community  We have no idea what we \u2019 re do  As be the case with most parent  Some have assemble around my blog and some have email me  The joy and struggle that come with raise a possibly LGBTQ child be much the same  whether you live in Untied States  Ireland or Dubai  I didn \u2019 t realize that until I be about six month into blogging  At about the six month mark  too  the hate mail nearly stop  I have prepare myself for it to only increase with time  But  the opposite happen  I think that there be three reason for this  The first be that I think people get the sense that I wasn \u2019 t go away  They be right  The second be that I think people saw  in the comment at the end of each post  that I have a huge amount of support  They be right  And  lastly  I think that if people read even one blog post they saw that I love my child and I \u2019 m just try to parent in the best  healthy  most loving way possible  They be right again  From time to time people will ask why I don \u2019 t approve negative comment to be publish on my blog  I would  if there be any  Hate speech  profanity  bully and foul comment wouldn \u2019 t see the light of day  But  constructive criticism  oppose view and uneducated opinion would be there for all to see  if there be any  I \u2019 m a little Type A  if you haven \u2019 t notice  So I write a plan for my blog before I start it  My plan be to publish two blog post a week  Monday \u2019 s blog post would be the meatier of the two  Thursday \u2019 s post would be brief  I \u2019 ve stuck to my schedule pretty well consider that I have a job  two active kid  a husband  friend  hobby and a life  But  at time  it have be tiresome  This be my 100th post  Cheers  It have be an amazing year of learn  We \u2019 ve learn a lot about ourselves and our son  We \u2019 ve learn that for the safety of our family  we may have to distance ourselves from certain type of people  We \u2019 ve learn who our real ally be  the people who will  no matter what  support u and join u a we take our journey and raise a gender nonconforming  possibly LGBTQ son  Most importantly  we \u2019 ve learn that we aren \u2019 t alone  We begin have play date with other gender creative family  I \u2019 ve build relationship with mom who travel this path and be a little further down the road than I be and be now raise amaze young adult  I \u2019 ve reconnected with people from my past who be struggle with their gender identification and sexuality before my very eyes  without me or our peer know  I \u2019 ve see the kind of father my husband be and have be amaze  Raising a child like CJ  can tear marriage apart  but  I can say that  after this year  I \u2019 ve never felt more secure and confidant in my marriage and the man I pick to spend the rest of my life with  I \u2019 ve see our old son start to \u201c get it  \u201d and start down the path of be a really cool person who have an open heart and open mind  He \u2019 s a person who know compassion  understanding  tolerance and  most of all  fun  He get thing that a lot of member of his peer group aren \u2019 t even aware of yet  In some way he \u2019 s year ahead with his innocence still intact  I can \u2019 t wait to see who he become  During the last year we \u2019 ve enter the warm embrace of the LGBTQ community and the community of family who be or have raise a gender creative child  That warm embrace feel good  it feel like home  We \u2019 ve learn the deadliness of gossip and how it can poison good thing  We \u2019 ve learn that prejudice can breed prejudice and work every day to teach our child to be tolerant  even when the favor isn \u2019 t return  One question that I do get a lot  still  be people wonder what I \u2019 m go to tell CJ  about the blog when he get old  In short  everything  I \u2019 ve write every post with him in mind  I \u2019 m glad that I \u2019 ve encourage myself to record the happening of his fourth year  These be story that entertain you and I hope that he hold them dear to his heart someday  More than that  I have other cool stuff to show him  like hundred and hundred of email of support and some email from people whose live we \u2019 ve change  Parents who give up struggle over gender and  instead  choose to simply love their child  no question ask  That be one of my proud achievement of 2011  ", "feedtitle": "Page 26 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
