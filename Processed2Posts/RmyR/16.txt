Ages four and five be the tough for u in term of parent a gender expansive child  I tell family that it get good once the child can communicate hisher thought and feeling  Like  now  with CJ  be 10 year old and get ready to start fifth grade  if I have a question about him  I can ask him and he can answer  I ask CJ  what he remember think and feel when he be four and five year old and I write it all down  I \u2019 m hoping that share CJ \u2019 s memory below might help family currently wonder andor struggle  xoxo  Lori  By  CJ  age 10  August 2017  When I be two year old I kind of liked car and knight and stuff because that \u2019 s all the toy we have  When I get closer to three year old  I start to like pink  purple and princess  By the time I be four year old  I like everything girl stuff  I really like the way girl \u2019 hair and dress move  In preschool and kindergarten  I get the hint that I wasn \u2019 t like other boy my age  They would wear superhero stuff and I would wear clothes that be more feminine  I even wear Little Mermaid pajama on pajama day and a Monster High costume on Halloween  At that time I don \u2019 t think I really care what other kid think about me  When you \u2019 re in preschool and kindergarten and you \u2019 re different  the other kid don \u2019 t really care a much  My mom say I use to ask every morning if I be go to get bully at school  but I don \u2019 t remember that  My mom say it \u2019 s good to forget stuff sometimes  Back when I be four and five year old  I use to tell my parent that I want to be a girl  I never say I be a girl  I just say I want to be a girl  Because then I could like all of the stuff and hobby and clothes that I like and nobody would care or give me a hard time about it  I use to draw myself a a girl  This summer  I go through my drawing from kindergarten and in all of them I have long ponytail and dress on  It surprise me when I saw that  When I saw those drawing  it make me realize how fast people can forget thing they do  I \u2019 m go into fifth grade now and that be just back in kindergarten  I guess I do remember want to be a girl if I think about it really hard  but I don \u2019 t want to be a girl anymore  I want to be me  Just me  I \u2019 m a gender creative boy  I \u2019 m a boy who like girl stuff  I don \u2019 t even like call it girl stuff and boy stuff  There shouldn \u2019 t be girl stuff and boy stuff  it \u2019 s all just stuff  Sometimes I don \u2019 t feel safe at school and other time I do feel safe  I don \u2019 t feel safe at school when I \u2019 m in the bathroom or when the fire alarm go off  I also don \u2019 t like be alone  I don \u2019 t feel safe in the bathroom because the boy just pee everywhere and they aren \u2019 t a neat and tidy a the girl  I \u2019 m more neat and tidy like the girl  I always go in the stall  even if I \u2019 m go pee  That make me feel more secure  I feel like I \u2019 m a different type of boy  But I \u2019 m a boy for sure  I like both male and female pronoun  I don \u2019 t really care which one people use when they talk about me  I feel like pronoun be no big deal  Pronouns be not important to me  rainbow be important to me  My mom say different thing be important to different people  People who be LGBTQ be important  That \u2019 s a fact  People who be different be very important because they be people  but not everybody see them that way  My mom and dad use to sometimes think I be transgender \u2013 a girl bear in a boy \u2019 s body  They even think about let me transition to be a girl when I be littler  That doesn \u2019 t bother me because I know I \u2019 d be a boy now  I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s possible that I \u2019 m transgender because I really like how I be  I \u2019 m happy with myself  My mom and dad tell me that some parent with kid who be four and five year old be really stress out because they have gender creative kid and they don \u2019 t know what to do  I would tell those parent to just relax and let your kid be who they be  And  let them know that you love them no matter what  That \u2019 s what my parent tell me  If I could talk to myself when I be four year old  I would tell myself \u201c don \u2019 t transition  because you be go to like who you be when you \u2019 re old  You can like girl stuff without be a girl  You can just be you \u201d But if a kid be transgender  their parent need to let their kid decide who they be and follow their kid \u2019 s lead  If your kid be transgender  let them transition  Let them be who they be  Sometimes it \u2019 s hard be a transgender kid or gender creative kid because you \u2019 ve get to take a lot of time to figure thing out  I think overall parent need to do a lot of relax  ",
