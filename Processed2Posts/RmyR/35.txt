Princesses and have a limited vocabulary  Now  he \u2019 s a nineyearold fourth grader who love drag queen  Andy Warhol and who talk nonstop  If I list all of the lesson I \u2019 ve learn during the last six year  it might take me another six year  The big lesson I \u2019 ve learn  To stop worrying  I use to worry so much  As much a you all read my worry  you \u2019 ll never know how much worry truly engulfed my heart and mind  I worry about what other people would think about CJ \u2019 s gender expression and identity  I worry about what they would say to and about him  How they would react to him  How he would be treat at school  What his future would look like  What we would do if he identify a trans  What we would do if he come out a gay  I worry about my obsessive worrying  Sometimes I \u2019 d catch myself not worry and then start worry about what I be forget to worry about  Then  our gender therapist help me manage the worry  Whenever I share a worry with her  she would say \u201c And then what would happen  \u201d My answer be always \u201c We \u2019 d deal with it \u201d For example\u2026  Me  I \u2019 m worry the kid at school will make fun of CJ  for wear girl clothes  Therapist  And  then what would happen  Me  We \u2019 d deal with it  More often than not it take many more \u201c And  then what would happen \u201d for me to get to the \u201c We \u2019 d deal with it \u201d But  I always get there  Always   If your answer isn \u2019 t \u201c We \u2019 ll deal with it \u201d If your answer have something to do with be embarrass by your child  love them less  resent them or want them to change  you need help  I don \u2019 t say it in a dismissive way  I say it earnestly  Please  seek help  From a supportive friend  a therapist  PFLAG  an online community  book  blog  anywhere safe and trusted   So  if I \u2019 d always deal with a worry whenif it become a reality  then why be I waste my time and stress myself out worry about it prematurely  Worry doesn \u2019 t prevent thing from happen  it just prevents you from enjoy the good thing that be actually happen  When I stop worry  I start enjoy the colorfulness of my unique son  That \u2019 s when life get happy  The beginning of this parent journey and this blog be fuel by worry  wine and chocolate  My busy blogging hour be in the dark of night \u2013 with the kid in bed  Matt at work and worry a my bedfellow  That \u2019 s not my life anymore  Thank God  I don \u2019 t spend my day defensively travel ahead of CJ  make sure the path be clear  safe and prepared for his rainbow arrival  I \u2019 m do with that exhaust rigamaro  I no longer live life ahead of my son  I live life with my son  I \u2019 m no longer hyper vigilant  I \u2019 m informative and matteroffact  I \u2019 m not angry about the way thing be  I \u2019 m eager to change them for the good  I \u2019 m sure of the thing I need to know and do to address the challenge that come our way because of CJ  I \u2019 m sure of the resource available to u and how to learn what I don \u2019 t know  I \u2019 m sure of my son  myself and \u2013 most importantly \u2014 my parenting  Surety erase worry  Confidence be calm  My son feel my surety and it \u2019 s good for him  In turn  it \u2019 s give him confidence and calm  He \u2019 s sure of who he be  his style  the village he belong to and the family that have his back no matter what  He know that the answer to \u201c what happen if\u2026 \u201d be always \u201c we \u2019 ll deal with it \u201d While I try to live in a place that be worryfree  it \u2019 s a place that \u2019 s certainly worryadjacent  I can cross the city line to worryville in no time  I just try not to unless it \u2019 s truly justified  I don \u2019 t worry  I work  So that when something happen and I have to react  I \u2019 m prepared  I want to be prepare  not paralyze with worry and fear  Now  I make the worry propel me into action  I \u2019 m worry about 2017  I \u2019 m worry about our future under the reign of the presidentelect  But  I \u2019 m focus on spending more time act and less time worrying  Action be productive  worry be not  The more I let go of worry  the harder it get to write  I don \u2019 t see blog post a we live our life  like I do six year ago  I don \u2019 t see his gender creativity a much  I don \u2019 t see his purse enter the room first  I don \u2019 t see his runway walk be practice down the grocery store aisle  I don \u2019 t see his French braid and lipgloss when I drop him off at school  I don \u2019 t see those thing  I just see him  ", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
