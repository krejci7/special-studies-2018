Conference  so check back here throughout the weekend for update \u2013 which I \u2019 ll be post to the top of the page  not the bottom  \ud83d\ude42 71413 at 440 pm \u2014 My favorite workshop of the conference be Diane Ehrensaft \u2019 s Understanding and Supporting Siblings of Gender Diverse Children and Youth  My Notes  It take a family to launch a gender nonconforming child\u2026but  that \u2019 s not necessarily what a sibling want to do or how they want to spend their time  Are we ask sibling to step outside their comfort zone andor do too much  Two important job of a parent be to help the child be their authentic self and to keep them safe  When you be raise a gender diverse child  sometimes it feel like those two job be at odds  Siblings be an often forgotten \u2014 but critical \u2014 part of the family support system  They outlive the parent  They be part of the same generation  And  they need support too  Siblings can be that child \u2019 s best ally or bad foe  depend on the circumstance  Sometimes the sibling have the ability to \u201c out \u201d their gender diverse sibling  They hold a lot of power  What will they do with that power  Are they be ask to keep a huge family secret  Is that fair  Siblings typically want to help  but they don \u2019 t know what to do or say and that can lead them to feel inadequate  Siblings can grow resentful of all the focus on gender  What do sibling need  Empathy about their own anxiety  confusion and vulnerability  A place where they can air their own feeling out independently  They need their own space and often don \u2019 t get it  A dialogue between only the sibling  with an adult a a listener   The sibling talk honestly  How do it feel to be gender diverse  How do it feel to have a gender diverse sibling  A toolkit  What will they say andor do when they get various question and reaction from other kid  71413 at 347 pm \u2014 I attend a workshop put on by the Human Rights Campaign  A while ago  the HRC

in  What you observe  What you experience  It \u2019 s the reaction to your gender expression that you notice and absorb  You don \u2019 t really have much of a choice when it come to your Gender Experience  When another parent cry a they struggle with their child \u2019 s gender identity  I cry too  I should have pack tissue  ", "feedtitle": "Page 17 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
