consisting of  indicate  or involve two  When I first start blogging about my adventure in raise a gender creative son  I wasn \u2019 t very educate when it come to gender  All I know be that I want everybody to be cool with my then3yearold son wear a dress and love the Disney Princesses  I want it to be okay for boy to like feminine thing and girl to like masculine thing  I didn \u2019 t know at first that I be fight the gender binary  Gender binary   n  the classification of gender into two distinct  opposite and disconnected form of masculine and feminine  Male vs female  Boy vs girl  Blue vs pink  Superhero vs princess  It seem like everybody want my son to be one or the other  Either or  People be uncomfortable with him live in the middle \u2014 in the no man \u2019 s and no woman \u2019 s land  Over the year  I \u2019 ve watch a thing start to change in regard to the public visibility  awareness  understand and acceptance of differently gendered people  The binary be be bust and I couldn \u2019 t have be happy  TIME Magazine even proclaim that society have reach \u201c the transgender tip point \u201d and that the transgender movement be poise to challenge deeply held cultural belief  Yes  Bring it on  America be finally talk about gender  It \u2019 s complexity  It \u2019 s fluidity  It \u2019 s individuality  The general public might  maybe  hopefully  be begin to understand the ridiculousness of the gender binary  For year  I \u2019 ve be share our family \u2019 s story in hope of encourage people to loosen up a little about gender  allow it to be fluid and support those who aren \u2019 t solely masculine or solely feminine  People can be both or neither or a unique mixture that can vary depend on the day or hour  For the sake of my son  I want the world to see that there be more than just two option when it come to gender expression and identity  Laverne Cox  Jazz Jennings  Caitlyn Jenner and others be help by live publicly  authentically and without shame  They be brave beyond belief and I \u2019 m so thankful for them  After all  if people can handle a former male Olympian a a female in a corset on the cover of Vanity Fair  surely they would be cool with my son wear a skirt while maintain that he \u2019 s a boy  But they weren \u2019 t  They aren \u2019 t  Things seem to swing in another direction  Because of the transgender movement  there have become a new binary  Cisgender vs transgender  Cisgender   adj   note or relate to a person whose gender identity correspond with that person \u2019 s biological sex assign at birth   Example  I be assign female at birth because of my vagina and my gender be female   Every time I publish a blog post or post to social medium and use masculine pronoun for my son  whether I \u2019 m talk about his desire to be call Mrs Clooney  get his ear pierce  etc    people \u2014 no matter how accepting and progressive they think they be \u2014 tell me I \u2019 m use the wrong pronoun  They insist that my son be transgender and that I \u2019 m not honor that  Good for them  Seriously  Good for more people push others to honor people who be transgender  But  gender police me sometimes seem like it isn \u2019 t an act of understanding  but rather an act prompt by a lack of understand  I couldn \u2019 t be honor my son \u2019 s gender identity any more when he be express himself a female and I use the masculine pronouns that he prefer  He be a boy who like to wear skirt  lipgloss  sparkly ballet flat and  for now  clip on earring  He know what it mean to be transgender  he \u2019 s watch two of his friend and countless adult transition  He insist that he be not transgender  He identify a gender nonconforming  He say he \u2019 s a boy who only like girl thing and want to be treat like a girl  He doesn \u2019 t like it when people use feminine pronoun to address or talk about him  He love his male anatomy  a 9yearold boy be wont to do   In the new gender binary  he have no home  Cisgender vs transgender  He \u2019 s neither  In the old gender binary  he have no home  Male vs female  He \u2019 s neither  So  still  I find myself fight a gender binary while explain my son \u2019 s gender identity and expression  That \u2019 s fine  I will do it until the day I die or until he ask me to stop  It \u2019 s just that  when I saw transgender education and acceptance come to the forefront  I expect thing to be different  I think that if society could see  start to understand and accept transgender people  which some consider to be at the very extreme end of the cisgendertransgender gender binary   that they would have no problem at all accept all of the people who be \u201c just \u201d gender nonconforming  We have to get beyond trans  Let \u2019 s make that the next social movement  Let \u2019 s get to the point where we say  \u201c Hey  I don \u2019 t know if that person be male or female or both or neither  so I \u2019 m just go to treat them like a person \u201d or \u201c My brain tell me to use female pronoun for that person but the person tell me to use masculine pronoun  so I \u2019 m go to masculine pronoun because what the hell do it matter to me   \u201d or \u201c That guy like to wear skirt  Cool \u201d Let \u2019 s respect every person \u2019 s unique gender journey by not believe in any binary  Let \u2019 s bust the binary  Once and
