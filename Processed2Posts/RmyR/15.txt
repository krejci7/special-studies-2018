just be himself  I tell Lori we be go to raise CJ  the same way we raise Chase \u2014 instill the same value and virtue \u2014 but that we would follow his lead and love him no matter what  I be like  \u2018 If he love Barbies  let \u2019 s give him Barbies  If he love wear dress  let \u2019 s buy him dress \u2019  \u201d Matt in an interview with MEL Magazine  Click here to read it  He have a bad day and need to go for a walk \u201c to gather himself \u201d I walk with him  Eventually he tell me the top three thing that be bother him  1  Someone eat the last of his Pringles  2  He felt like he wasn \u2019 t very helpful in the escape room we do  3  He \u2019 s sad that some parent don \u2019 t love their kid anymore when they come out a LGBTQ  Those be some big problem for a 10 year old  And  that last one  be rough on a person no matter their age  When CJ tell me one of the thing bother him  see previous picpost  be that some parent reject their kid for be LGBTQ  this quote keep loop through my head  It \u2019 s exactly how I feel about CJ  Chase and Matt  It \u2019 s how every parent should feel about their LGBTQ child  And they should communicate it clearly in word and action  Everyone should feel that a handful of people \u2014 or  at the very least  a parent \u2014 would choose them  Channel your inner CJ today  Say \u201c Yaaaaas Qweeeeen \u201d when your bos ask you to do something  Say \u201c water off a duck back \u201d and flick your wrist and roll your eye when someone say something rude to you  Eat ice cream for lunch and pickle for dinner  Create something fantastic  Be in bed with a good book by 9 pm  Live that CJ life  Another week of sew camp all stitch up  \u201c My teacher really have her hand full this week  There be so many girl who have never sew before  This one girl keep say her sewing machine be broken and I be all \u2018 Gurl  You \u2019 re machine be not break  Here  let me thread it for you \u2019 Then I help every girl thread her machine  I \u2019 m basically the teacher \u2019 s aide and should get pay  10 for the week \u201d Flashbacking to little CJ this Friday  He \u2019 s werking and twerking on his first day of preschool  While I love the pose in this pic  I can only focus on his polo shirt \u2019 s pink stripe  Why  Because he want a pink shirt from the girl section and I wouldn \u2019 t buy it  He be four and I be struggle with his gender expression  I be afraid that the start of school would bring the start of bullying  So I force him to focus on and get excite about the pink stripe on his polo shirt  Now  look back from where I be today  I get mad at myself and feel bad for CJ when I look at this pic  He be four year old  It be the tough age for a lot of reason  The terrible two be nothing  Nobody talk about the fucking four  And  when CJ be four  we be at the height of our struggle with his gender identity and gender expression  Schools start  If your boy want a pink shirt  get it  Don \u2019 t settle for a pink stripe  You \u2019 re look at proof that I \u2019 m a good mom and my kid be reach age appropriate milestone  CJ  age 10  can now flat iron my hair for me while I look at my phone  I \u2019 ve dreamt of this day  I \u2019 ve be wait to write the date in his baby book  Today be the day  August 14  2017   neverforget  mommingsohard  momlife Backseat confession on the way home from gymnastics practice  Matt  CJ  this be the church where your mom and I get marry  Stand in front of it so I can send her a pic at work  Me from the Nordstrom shoe dept  Where be you  Matt  We be in the makeup department  A great guy saw CJ look at the makeup and I tell him that CJ be in to makeup and want to be a makeup artist  He be give CJ a free makeover  Upon see my third grade school picture\u2026 CJ  Mom  You be gender nonconforming  too   Me  No  CJ  Then why be you wear a tie  Me  Because it make me feel powerful  I want to be a successful businesswoman and that be my \u201c power suit \u201d When I wear that outfit I always get compliment  People say I look smart and like a bos  Why  Because masculinity in female be see a a strength  But  femininity in male be see a a weakness  So  CJ doesn \u2019 t get the same kind of praise when he wear a skirt\u2026even though that \u2019 s the clothing that make him feel powerful     ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Raising My
