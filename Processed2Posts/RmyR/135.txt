\u2019 ve read my book  she \u2019 s in there  She \u2019 s the one who  after I mention the idea of start this blog once  would never let me not do it  She \u2019 s encouraging and awesome like that  She \u2019 s also accompany me on many  many adventure in support of the blog and book \u2013 she have now ride a subway  dance the night away in a gay club  stand with me lose for an hour on a lessthandesireable street corner and sit through more genderLGBTQ presentation and workshop than most licensed professional  During our many adventure  she be often ask what it \u2019 s like to be friend with u  how she support our family a we raise CJ  and what nonfamily ally can do to help  Here be her thought  Marie \u2019 s daughter Grace be four week old than CJ  They love each other  I have be friend with CJ \u2019 s Mom for about 15 year now  We meet in college and bond over our love of the write word and literature on a trip host by our fabulous English professor  We have be through birth  miscarriage  silly time  sad time  drunk time and \u2014 of utmost importance \u2014 parent time  Parenting isn \u2019 t easy  Period  There be no manual  we all know this  God sometimes throw curve ball at u  Well  he throw one right into CJ \u2019 s Mom and CJ \u2019 s Dad \u2019 s home  It be a perfectly pitch curve ball too \u2013 the batter at the plate say  \u201c Yep  I \u2019 ll take a swing at it \u201d and the team manager support the decision  Since then  there have be a few single  double and triple  even a homerun or two  Every once in a while  they strike out  but in my humble opinion  it \u2019 s a rare occasion  My family have be on this journey with CJ \u2019 s parent the entire time and so maybe that help when it come to acceptance  We know CJ  BB   Before Barbie  and we love him  And  we know CJ  AB   After Barbie  and we love him  One thing I know about the AB  CJ  be that his personality be far more outgoing  He want to be involve in thing  have opinion about thing and love imaginative play  The BB  CJ  be sweet  but his personality be not a bold and sociable a the AB  CJ  When CJ \u2019 s parent embrace him for everything he love and want to play with  CJ  begin to sparkle  There \u2019 s no other way to put it  He sparkle  All parent want  or should want  their child to sparkle and sometimes it take a little extra time to find the one thing that trigger the glittery moment \u2013 but when they do  love and nurture parent will move Heaven and Earth to make it happen for their child on a consistent basis  I can not imagine a world where CJ  be force to play with a toy he didn \u2019 t like all because people say the toy he do like wasn \u2019 t \u201c for boys \u201d I will admit  it be uncomfortable at first  I win \u2019 t lie  Not that I be personally uncomfortable with buy doll or other \u201c girl toy \u201d for CJ   after all  our  adult  feeling don \u2019 t really matter in all this  The person \u2019 s whose feeling matter be the child \u2019 s  But that be just it \u2013 I didn \u2019 t know how to react to CJ \u2019 s feeling and at that  didn \u2019 t know how to react to CJ \u2019 s parent \u2019 feeling about CJ \u2019 s feeling  Sound familiar    If you know anything about this blog  it should   For about a year  I call and ask  \u201c Is it ok if we buy CJ  this or that for Christmas  his birthday or just because I be pick it up for my daughter  \u201d The answer be a bit hesitant at first  because they be navigate new water  but it didn \u2019 t take long for the answer to become a resounding \u201c yep \u201d Now  there \u2019 s no reason to call  CJ  and Grace even coordinate their Halloween costume  CJ  and Chase and my two daughter have grow up together and everything be very normal for them  Both my daughter have stand up for CJ  when other girl have say his like girl \u2019 s thing be \u201c weird \u201d or that he should only like \u201c boy \u2019 s stuff \u201d Families with gender nonconforming child have to surround themselves with likeminded people \u2013 people who be tolerant and patient  understanding and compassionate  There be no room for hate or ignorance  I can \u2019 t imagine how tough it be on people who do not have a structure support system  As family and friend  our job be to help with kindness  not criticize with disdain  This be not an area for you to offer advice unless you \u2019 re ask for it  In my experience  CJ \u2019 s parent question all decision  no matter how insignificant they may have be  The last thing parent need be someone give his or her two cent  add to the confusion  Stay positive and love the child  and family  whether you \u2019 re in a public or a private setting  You can \u2019 t say thing be okay at home and then turn your back on the family when you be in public  You shouldn \u2019 t be expect to \u201c get it \u201d out of the gate  either  Some people be naturally go to be more accept than others  but the best thing you can do be love and support the family a they journey down their path  Don \u2019 t turn your back on them or dismiss their feeling a insignificant or trivial  The child may or may not be go through a \u201c phase \u201d and you do not want to be a part of bully a child  The family will appreciate you be open to their new situation and trust me \u2013 no one be more nervous than the parent  Like CJ \u2019 s Mom have say before  they have lose several undeserving friend throughout this journey  Friends who wouldn \u2019 t accept CJ  or the rest of the family because he didn \u2019 t conform to society \u2019 s \u201c norms \u201d Shame on them  Too bad for them  They  and others like them  be miss out on know a beautiful family who have much to offer others  Give the family time to figure thing out  CJ \u2019 s Mom and Dad revise their plan daily a they follow CJ \u2019 s lead  Allow your family and friend to do the same  Follow them  Be there to listen  Above all else  a favorite saying of mine and CJ \u2019 s Mom be  \u201c Just don \u2019 t be an asshole \u201d What do you think  How can nonfamily ally support friend raise a differentlygendered child
