their sexuality would never change the way I feel about them  They can be anywhere on the spectrum of sexuality and still have my unconditional love  acceptance and support  But  when they stake a claim on the spectrum like CJ \u2019 s Brother do  they have to know that I hear them and believe them  So  my old son be go into the fifth grade at the school for gifted student  He have his sight
