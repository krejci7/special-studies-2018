to protect LGBT and gender creative kid  Although I \u2019 m a cardcarrying PTA member  I \u2019 ve attend only three PTA meeting in my six year a mother to an elementaryschoolaged child  Each time I sit through the meeting feeling like the PTA wasn \u2019 t the place for me  But  hell  if they be go to be discuss LGBT and gender issue  maybe I have be wrong  I walk into the crowd Multipurpose Room and find a seat in the back corner by myself  I listen a the PTA board and it member run through the agenda  When they start passionately discuss the nutritional value of wholewheat goldfish cracker versus original goldfish cracker  I tune out  I will never argue about goldfish cracker  of that you can be sure  Finally it be LGBT time  To start  the presenter rattle off statistic from GLSEN \u2019 s late National School Climate Survey  I use the same number when I present to group  They be powerful  At school  74 percent of LGBT student be verbally harass in the past year because of their sexual orientation and 55 percent because of their gender expression  As a result of feel unsafe or uncomfortable at school  30 percent of LGBT student miss at least one day of school in the past month  A hostile school climate affect student \u2019 academic success and mental health  Grade point average for these student be between nine and 15 percent low than for others  LGBT student who experience victimization and discrimination at school have bad educational outcome and poor psychological wellbeing  \u201c I don \u2019 t believe those number  \u201d a mother in my row blurt out  startle me  \u201c Yeah  Where do you get those number from   \u201d another mom shout from one row over  The presenter start to reply  \u201c They \u2019 re actually from a survey GLSEN does\u2026 \u201d \u201c Who   \u201d a mom question  \u201c GLSEN\u2026 \u201d \u201c I \u2019 ve never heard of them  \u201d a mom yell  Another mom be skeptically write down the name so that she could look GLSEN up when she get home  \u201c Are those number for elementary student   They have to be for only high schoolers and this be an elementary school  \u201d \u201c They be for all student  \u201d the speaker reply   The number be actually for middle school and high school student   \u201c But  not in our area  Those aren \u2019 t Orange County number  \u201d For a group that try to stick strictly to Robert \u2019 s Rules of Order  this be an unruly behavior  The presenter carry on bravely in the face of rudeness and righteousness  \u201c What do we call girl who like play with boy toy and wear boy thing  \u201d he ask  \u201c Tomboys  \u201d the mom next to me shout out  proud of herself for know the right answer  \u201c Great  And  what do we call boy who like to play with girl toy and wear girl thing  \u201d \u201c Gay Boys  \u201d she shout just a assuredly  My head whip instinctively in her direction and not for any reason other than I could not believe she would think it be okay to volunteer that answer out loud in public  She felt me look at her  \u201c What   That \u2019 s what they call them  \u201d she say  like I be the stupid one  The presenter start go through a list of the state and national law in place to protect LGBTQ and differently gendered kid  When he get halfway down the list of law  to AB 1266  the crowd go wild  AB 1266 be a California law state that a student can not be discriminate against base on their sex  gender  gender identity or gender expression  Specifically  they can play on the sport team and use the restroom that be consistent with their gender identity  \u201c The law be protect these trans kid but not the normal kid  \u201d \u201c I \u2019 ve talk to several of my attorney about this law\u2026 \u201d \u201c I don \u2019 t want a girl in the boy bathroom look at my son \u2019 s penis  \u201d \u201c They should build them their own bathroom so they aren \u2019 t in there with other kid  \u201d \u201c There be two of \u2018 them \u2019 at our school use the girl bathroom  Two  \u201d Heat take over my entire body  My heart have either stop beat entirely or be beat so hard that it would explode  I be go to drop dead at the PTA meeting  They be talk about my gender nonconforming son  Trust me  I know  because this have be an issue for more than a year  People believe that my son use the girl \u2019 restroom  And  it \u2019 s not just people at our school who believe it  It \u2019 s a rumor that have spread through the district and all the way to the local mega church  force my parent out of a bible study when a fellow Christian berate them through clench teeth in front of their small group of fellow believer  \u201c There \u2019 s two   \u201d \u201c Yes  TWO  \u201d By the tone of their voice and look on their face  I could tell that these mother hate my child because of where they think he relieve himself  I want to defend my son  I don \u2019 t want anybody to hate my child  I want to fight for his honor  but I need to get myself under control first \u2014 or who know what might fly out of my mouth  As I collect my thought  the mob mentality have set in  The mom in the room be influence and encourage by the behavior and opinion of their peer  They couldn \u2019 t believe that any person in the room  other than the presenter  might have a differ point of view  To quiet the crowd  the presenter turn on a 2020 clip feature Jazz Jennings  a transgender teen advocate who be nothing short of amaze  I smile at Jazz  her supportive family  her mermaid swim fin and her happiness  \u201c Those parent be play God  \u201d a mother say loudly a she cross her arm angrily over her chest and shake her head in disgust  \u201c Yeah  and now that poor thing be sterile  \u201d say another mom  Like a child be break if it can \u2019 t procreate  Like there \u2019 s no other way for a family to form  When the clip be over the meeting be over and I have to rush to get my kid  Later  I sit with Matt and tell him about the meeting  \u201c We \u2019 ve get to pull CJ  out of that school  Those people be fuck crazy  \u201d he insist  \u201c No  the school administration be great  I trust them  And his teacher be a dream come true  It \u2019 s just the PTA mom who be horrible  And  as much a they would hate to hear it  they be inconsequential  Their opinion don \u2019 t matter  \u201d I say  \u201c You \u2019 re not go to another PTA meeting  we don \u2019 t need to be around people like that \u201d \u201c That will be the last PTA meeting I ever attend  trust me  \u201d ", "feedtitle":
