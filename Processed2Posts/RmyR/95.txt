cheerleader  like my son hop to be one day  Ronin be describe a positive and happy  like my son be often describe  He endure bullying because he like something that some people be \u201c only for girls \u201d Sadly  my son know exactly how that feel  Last week  12yearold Ronin decide to end the bullying by end his life  I worry every day that my son will have this too in common with Ronin  Because the group of kid like Ronin and my son have the high rate of suicide attempt in the world  The article about Ronin \u2019 s death report that in the year lead up to his suicide  Ronin \u2019 s parent make multiple complaint to his school about the homophobic and genderbased bully their son be experience  The school \u2019 s response be inadequate and the bullying continue  Even after his parent remove him for school to homeschool him  Ronin continue to experience bully that become unbearable  As I read the coverage of his death  I \u2019 m swallow by sorrow and anger  So many people fail Ronin  his bully  the adult responsible for those bully  people who know about the bullying but do nothing to end it  the school  the district  and the state  California \u2019 s safe school law be comprehensive and advance in comparison to other state  California lead the nation in establish law to protect perceived and confirm LGBTQ kid and  then  the state fail these kid miserably by not enforce the law the way in which they have promise to do  Our family \u2019 s child advocate and antibullying superhero Karyl Ketchum recently travel to Sacramento with a colleague to meet the staff at the California Department of Education Office of Equal Opportunity  The office be create to investigate complaint of bullying and discrimination against school and district throughout California and enforce the state \u2019 s excellent safe school law and education code  While at the office  Ketchum discover that the California Department of Education Office of Equal Opportunity have not investigate a single claim of discrimination file by or on behalf of student across the state  The office \u2019 s failure to enforce antibullying law have result in dangerous  systemwide ignorance and unaccountability in California \u2019 s school  The Education Office of Equal Opportunity doesn \u2019 t even log or track appeal  The ongoing systemic failure be detail in the scathing 2013 California State Auditor \u2019 s Office \u2019 s report summarize here  http  wwwauditorcagovreportssummary2012108 \u201c Students across our state be wait indefinitely on news of their appeal and for relief from the bullying they be experience  relief that  under the current system  will likely never come  \u201d Ketchum say  \u201c In the entire history of the California Department of Education Office of Equal Opportunity there have never be a single actual investigation into the veracity of a student \u2019 s complaint of bullying  harassment  or discrimination  This situation constitute a state of emergency for our child  We need a response from the California Department of Education that measure up to the size and scope of this emergency \u201d I don \u2019 t know if Ronin \u2019 s parent file an official uniform complaint form with the school  district or California Department of Education Office of Equal Opportunity  But  I have to believe that if the California Department of Education Office of Equal Opportunity be do it \u2019 s job  school and district would be more informed about the law they be suppose to be abide and guide by  Schools and district would know that they have to answer to someone  And  when Ronin \u2019 s parent bring the bullying to their attention  action would have be swift  not stumble  Until more school and district understand and enforce the protection kid like my son and Ronin be entitle to  I \u2019 m terrify that we will continue to hear of more outcome like Ronin \u2019 s  If other parent can \u2019 t teach their kid to treat others like they want to be treat  for family like ours  school  district and the California Department of Education Office of Equal Opportunity be our only hope  Right now that hope seem dim  If you want to do something to help LGBTQ kid and their family in California  please email andor phone State Superintendent Tom Torlakson \u2019 s office and let him know that ignore the situation at California Department of Education Office of Equal Opportunity be dangerous and must stop  Please join me in demand that California Department of Education Office of Equal Opportunity be restructure  appropriately resourced and that it become computerized now\u2026before we lose one more young person  Torlakson can be reach at 9163190800 and EHughes  cdecagov  If you or a young LGBTQ person you
