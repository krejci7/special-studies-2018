Goss"], "text": "I meet awardwinning musician Tom Goss when he ask our family to appear in the music video for his song \u201c Illuminate The Dark \u201d \u2013 a song about the devastating effect of negatively judge people base on look and before know anything about them  My son fell in love with Goss instantly because he sing  play guitar and can do flip on a trampoline  I fell in love with Goss because of his voice  his LGBTQ advocacy work and because he overflow with kindness  When he allow me a sneak peak of the music video for his new song \u201c Breath  Sound  \u201d it beauty  simplicity and powerful message hold me captive  \u201c Breath  Sound \u201d illustrate through lyrical dance that the act of fall in love and the cadence of a relationship be the same for all couple  regardless of sexual orientation  gender or color  I recently sit down with Goss to talk about \u201c Breath  Sound \u201d for HuffPost Gay Voices  Me  With the Supreme Court \u2019 s June ruling in favor of marriage equality  the timing couldn \u2019 t be good for this video \u2019 s release  don \u2019 t you think  Tom Goss  Yes  It \u2019 s amazing to see how this country have grow and evolve in term of it acceptance of all kind of love  We be experience a momentous time  but that \u2019 s not to say the work be do  We have to continue to have an open dialogue to live harmoniously  I hope that my music and video like this one encourage that dialogue  Me  What do you hope the LGBTQ community will feel when they watch this video  Tom  I want them to feel like I \u2019 m tell their story  I want them to be move  That \u2019 s why I \u2019 m do this  There isn \u2019 t enough LGBTQ content be produce  Historically  people have be afraid to tell these story \u2013 but I \u2019 m not  I will always use my voice to help tell the story of those who can not  Me  What do you hope people outside of the LGBTQ community feel when they watch it  Tom  I want them to understand the boundlessness of love  There \u2019 s a reason the first verse focus on the straight couple alone \u2014 that \u2019 s what they be use to see  I want straight people to be draw into a familiar story  one they understand and relate to  Once there  I want to show them that this exact same story be be live by the LGBTQ community  As a gay man  I don \u2019 t want special privilege  I just want to love \u2013 passionately  fearlessly and completely  Me  How do you come up with the initial concept for this video  Tom  I \u2019 ve be dream about this video for year  As soon a we record the song I know I want to shoot a lyrical dance because I \u2019 m fascinate by movement and even more so by collaborative project  About six month ago I be explain my vision to director Michael Serrato  Big Gay Sketch Show  Willam Belli and Violet Chachki music video  and Neil \u2019 s Puppet Dreams   I tell him about my big  complex  beautiful \u2014 but ultimately flaw idea \u2014 and he start get as excite a I be and share idea of his own  His idea solve the problem I be have in the story and it become clear that it be something that we could accomplish together  Me  The dance be such a beautiful metaphor for the flow of a relationship\u2026 Tom  If you think about it  all relationship be really a kind of dance  We want to be close to somebody  but we \u2019 re afraid to let them too close  We come together  we push each other away  We choose the movement to highlight that experience  This feeling isn \u2019 t confine to one specific kind of relationship  it doesn \u2019 t understand gender or sexual orientation  The dance of attraction and love be a universal one  The dance be the same regardless of the dancer  Me  At first watch  the video look simple and effortless  but then I get to think about the choreography  edit and about how sometimes make something seem simple be very hard work  What be the hard part about make the video  Tom  The hard part wasn \u2019 t on my shoulder  but on the dancer \u2019  It be inspire to see how connected they become to each other throughout shoot  Everyone involve believe in the concept  the song and it potential to spur something beautiful  They commit to me  Michael and each other \u2014 help build something great than the sum of it part  Me  What other great project be you work on  Tom  I \u2019 m in preproduction on a video address LGBTQ youth and suicide prevention  I \u2019 m extremely excite about the team we be build for this project  I believe it have the potential to reach a lot of people  More than anything  I want to help make the world a good place  I think this video will do just that  ", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
