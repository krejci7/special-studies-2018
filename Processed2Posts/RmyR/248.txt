 While Uncle Uncle try to hide his elfish laughter behind his mug of spiked eggnog  I cross the room  retrieve the Beyblade  show it to CJ  and explain to him that it be a pink Beyblade and that maybe Santa give it to him so that he could Beyblade battle with his brother and the neighbor kid  Then  and only then  do CJ  consider forgive Santa  For the past two and a half  gender nonconforming year
