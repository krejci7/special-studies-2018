to RuPaul \u2019 s Drag Race while Matt and I be out of town  CJ  be immediately obsessed and we watch season eight a it air  Since then  we \u2019 ve watch season four  five and six for free on Amazon thanks to our Prime membership  You guy  That \u2019 s 31 hour of drag queen   summerofqueens I \u2019 m have a hell of a time remember which queen and challenge belong to which season  It \u2019 s all a tucked and contoured blur at this point  Thankfully  season two of RuPaul \u2019 s Drag Race All Stars start a week after we run out of free episode to watch  To CJ  few thing in life be good than All Stars  It \u2019 s like eat all of his favorite food at one meal while wear all of his favorite accessory  It \u2019 s all of his favorite queen in the same place at the same time  Here be CJ \u2019 s thought on RuPaul \u2019 s Drag Race All Stars  Season 2  Episode 1  I \u2019 m go to be in RuPaul \u2019 s Drag Race Hall of Fame one day  FYI  I be sooooo happy when I saw Detox and Adore  but my total favorite be Alaska  I have my picture take next to Alaska \u2019 s portion of the World War II Memorial in Washington  DC  because she \u2019 s my favorite drag queen  The funny part of the episode be when someone tell Alaska that she look pretty and she say that she get her look from Party City use a Groupon  I love Party City  too  I love that Adore want to look like a Monster High Doll  I use to love Monster High Dolls  I guess I still do  kind of  I like Phi Phi \u2019 s new cosplay style  it remind me of Kim Chi \u2019 s style  I love Kim Chi  I wonder if Mrs Chi know that Kim Chi be a drag queen yet  She probably do by now  When I saw CoCo  I say \u201c Ugggghhhhhh \u201d I don \u2019 t think she will make it far  This be me watch All Stars  I love the Talent Show Extravaganza challenge idea  Especially because my second favorite show be America \u2019 s Got Talent  My third favorite show be Cupcake Wars  During the talent show  the judge should have hit a big  red \u201c X \u201d if the act be bad like they do on America \u2019 s Got Talent  I keep expect that  CoCo be the bad in the talent show  No offense  Roxxxy look well this season  When I ask my mom what \u201c burlesque dance \u201d be she say it be \u201c old timey sexy dancing \u201d I love  love  love Alaska \u2019 s song  She be the best in the talent show  Courtney Act would have do good in the talent show if she be on All Stars  But she \u2019 s not  I think Adore get implant in her lip  We have to skip Tatianna \u2019 s act because my Uncle Michael tell my mom that it be not appropriate for me to watch  My mom wouldn \u2019 t tell me what be so inappropriate about it  So  I ask my uncle and he say it be about sex  I \u2019 m never go to understand the new elimination process  I don \u2019 t think RuPaul should have change it  I \u2019 m also never go to remember to say  \u201c Now the time have come to lip sync for your legacy \u201d I \u2019 m too use to say \u201c Now the time have come to lip sync for your life \u201d Eyebrows be a lot of work  I don \u2019 t think Adore be prepare for All Stars  That make me sad for her  I hope she stay  CoCo deserve to get eliminate  if you ask me  She can not get her face makeup right  I can \u2019 t wait for the next episode  Love  CJ   Age 9  Fourth grade  Future Drag Queen  We \u2019 ve have to update our rule for watch RuPaul \u2019 s Drag Race  I \u2019 ve be contact by some parent who use our rule in their family  so see below for the late version  Current Rules CJ  Must Follow In Order To Watch RuPaul \u2019 s Drag Race All homework and chore must be do  You must watch it with your mom or dad  We don \u2019 t use the word \u201c fishy \u201d or \u201c juicy \u201d to describe people  We don \u2019 t use the word \u201c bitch \u201d and \u201c fuck \u201d  Well  I do  but he \u2019 s not allow yet   We don \u2019 t use the word \u201c Shemail \u201d Even though RuPaul say \u201c Condragulations \u201d the real word be \u201c Congratulations \u201d and we use that   In case it \u2019 s ever on a spelling test   We don \u2019 t put glue stick in our eyebrow until we be a little bit old or have adult supervision for the application and removal   I \u2019 m not look forward to deal with this mess   We don \u2019 t attempt to glue our wig to our head   I wouldn \u2019 t even know where to begin   We fast forward through some \u201c Shade Throwing \u201d and \u201c Reading \u201d because that \u2019 s not a nice way to talk to people   I think he will eventually need to learn to throw shade  but not just yet   As soon a the show be over  it \u2019 s time to immediately sashay away to bed  ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
