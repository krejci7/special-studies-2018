Duh  He go search through his dressup bin look for his grass skirt that I bring back from Hawaii last summer  He couldn \u2019 t find it  Maybe because it have morph into a tangled  grassy mess with at least one piece of gum in it and it end up in the trash  Maybe  \u201c But I NEED a grass skirt for my Hawaii graduation  I NEED to look like a hula girl  \u201d CJ  inform me  I  in turn  email Ms Sensible to let her know that my son would be wear at least some portion of a hula girl getup to the graduation ceremony  We be go out of prek with a bang  I let him look for the longgone grass skirt for two day  because it keep him busy  And because I would never admit to purge it  Ms Sensible reply to my himysonwantstowearaskirttograduation email  She let me know that a few of the girl in class plan on wear grass skirt to graduation and that CJ  should feel free to do the same if he want to  We set off to Party City to replace the losttrashedmissing grass skirt  As luck would have it  they be just set up three aisle of luau party supply that will remain intact until they be convert to the costume aisle for Halloween  CJ  in between his two best girl friend  CJ  have his pick of the litter  There be grass skirt in a variety of color  rainbow  pink  orange  green  brown  natural  blue and yellow  I saw the rainbow color skirt and know that that would be the one CJ  would pick  I \u2019 d stand there and let him go through the decisionmaking process  He couldn \u2019 t decide and he couldn \u2019 t decide and he couldn \u2019 t decide  \u201c I think you \u2019 d want the rainbow one for sure  \u201d I say  \u201c I think I want the blue one  \u201d he say after some more consideration  I be speechless  CJ  have never  ever  pick a blue anything  I be afraid he be pick it because  if he be go to wear a skirt for all of his classmate and their family to see he felt like it would be safe to wear a boycolored one  \u201c Baby  it \u2019 s up to you if you want to wear a grass skirt or not  It \u2019 s your choice  And  you can pick any color you want  \u201d I remind him  \u201c I want the blue one  I like the blue one \u201d \u201c Are you sure  Once we buy it that \u2019 s it  no go back  no change your mind  \u201d I say  \u201c I \u2019 m sure  I want the blue skirt \u201d \u201c Alright then  let \u2019 s go pay for it \u201d We get home and he immediately put the skirt on  He move throughout the house all even very carefully  so that he wouldn \u2019 t get his grass tangle  Before he go to bed that night  he lay out his outfit for the next day \u2019 s graduation ceremony  Light blue and cream plaid shirt  khaki short  brown sandal  blue and green grass skirt  rainbow lei and a fake corsage for each wrist \u2014 one blue and one red  He put extra leavein conditioner in his hair because he be convince that the berrysmelling spray make his hair grow longer and pretty faster  He get in bed early and didn \u2019 t fall asleep until after 11 pm  Tomorrow he would be a graduate  The next day  a we walk to his classroom  CJ  be beam  He be the only one wear a grass skirt  none of the girl in class have \u2014 a they say they would \u2014 wear a grass skirt  I be worry that CJ  would want to take his skirt off  that he wouldn \u2019 t want to be the only one in a grass skirt  On the contrary  be the only one in a grass skirt and make his girl friends a little envious make him feel even more fabulous  As far a he be concern he be the star of the graduation  \u201c I like your hulagirl skirt  CJ  \u201d Molly say  \u201c My mom
