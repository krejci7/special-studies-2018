to come out be different for every person  For my brother it be in a mailed letter  I be sit at the dining room table do homework with my boyfriend when my mom come home from work and start open the mail  She stop halfway through the stack of envelope and catalog  She go up to her room and come back down wear a sweatsuit and say she be go for a walk  That \u2019 s when I know something be wrong  My mom never go for a walk and I didn \u2019 t even know she own a sweatsuit  let alone the bright white sneaker that serve a warn light on her foot  After she walk out the door  my boyfriend and I star at each other without speak  This wasn \u2019 t the nightly routine  She return hour later  She be sweaty and I could tell she have be cry  She tell my boyfriend that he need to go home  but didn \u2019 t offer him a ride  Something life change have happen  or be happen  I brace myself  She say she need to talk to me and I follow her to my room  She start talk in a tone that be force calm  measure calm  scary calm  \u201c I get this letter in the mail today  \u201d she start  wave the envelope in the air  I rack my brain try to think of what the letter could possibly say  I come up with nothing that would warrant my mother put on a sweatsuit  \u201c This letter be from your brother and you know what it say  \u201d she ask  I shake my head  \u201c Do you know what he be  \u201d she say  The scary calm be fading  now she be just scary  \u201c He \u2019 s gay \u201d \u201c So  \u201d I think to myself  \u201c Shit \u201d I think to myself  \u201c This be go to suck \u201d I think to myself  She be still talk  but I couldn \u2019 t hear her because I be think a lot of thing to myself  \u201c This doesn \u2019 t mean that you \u2019 re gay  You have to promise me that you don \u2019 t think you \u2019 re gay  \u201d my mom say  finally get my attention  Wait  What  What do my brother come out have to do with my sexuality  Hours early I have be make out with my boyfriend when we have the house to ourselves  But\u2026I be oddly  strongly attract to the girl who sit in front of me in English class  Maybe I be gay  No  I couldn \u2019 t be gay  Only one of u could be gay and my brother have clearly already call dibs  If him be gay force my mom into a sweatsuit  I could only imagine what me be gay would force her into  She retreat to her bedroom and close the door  I hear yell and cry all night  She didn \u2019 t go to work the next day  When I get home from school she tell me to get in the car immediately because I have an appointment to see a therapist  \u201c Why  \u201d I ask  With all due respect  it seem like she be the one who need a therapist  \u201c Because your brother be gay be go to be a lot for you to deal with \u201d It be  Once awkwardly sit in the therapist \u2019 s office with my mom cry in the waiting room  the therapist open our time together with a prayer  PFLAG brochure circa 1992 Then  for an hour  she tell me what the bible say about gay people  She teach me how to pray for my brother so that he might see the error in his way  ask for forgiveness and  once again  lead a godly life  She teach me how to pray for myself so God would know I love my brother  but didn \u2019 t agree with his sin  The therapist tell me not to tell anybody that my brother be gay  I sit in silent revolt  The therapist obviously didn \u2019 t like my brother  so  therefore  I didn \u2019 t like her  I be suppose to meet with her once a week  I refuse \u2014 lead my mother to firmly believe that she have fail a a parent  The relationship that my mom have with each of u a individual and together a a sibling unit be never the same  She make my brother tell me himself over the phone that he be gay  Like it be a punishment  I be just happy to hear his voice  until I hear that he be cry  I cry too  not because he be gay  but because he be in pain  I didn \u2019 t tell Michael about my therapy session until much later because I know it would hurt his feeling  And  it do  But  at some point when I be feel like he think that his come out affect only him  I need him to know that it affect me too  It \u2019 s a major plot twist in my life story  Coming out isn \u2019 t just about the LGBTQ person  Conversion therapy isn \u2019 t just for LGBTQ people  But  I always know that however bad I have it  my brother have it bad  PFLAG brochure circa 1992 Before her death a year and a half ago  my mom cry to me and tell me that she felt like a failure a a mother because of her reaction when my brother come out  She say that  at time  her love for my brother  for her kid  didn \u2019 t triumph over her concern about what others would think or say  Weeks before she die she tell my brother in word on a card  Going through a box of my mom \u2019 s stuff last week  I find a huge envelope stuffed with paper send to her by her sister the week that my brother come out  The note say  \u201c When you \u2019 re ready  maybe some of this info will help \u201d Handouts  copy and brochure from an organization call PFLAG follow the note  I hold them in my hand  thinking of my mother \u2019 s sweatsuit  my brother \u2019 s tear  the therapist \u2019 s prayer and I think about how different my family \u2019 s life could have be if my mom and I have attend a PFLAG meeting instead of a religious therapist  If you be an adult or parent
