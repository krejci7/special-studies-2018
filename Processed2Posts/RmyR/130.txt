a tough one to get   I be pleasantly surprise when the American Girl customer service rep ask  \u201c What be the birthday child \u2019 s name  How old will the birthday child be turn  \u201d She didn \u2019 t assume that the birthday child be a girl  I tell her that the birthday child be a boy and there wasn \u2019 t a moment \u2019 s hesitation  \u201c Do you a lot of boy celebrate their birthday at the American Girl Place  \u201d I ask because I \u2019 m always curious  \u201c It \u2019 s not common  but it happen frequently  \u201d she reply  not skip a beat  \u201c Do you do anything differently depend on whether the birthday child be a girl or a boy  \u201d I ask  They didn \u2019 t  I be pleased  again  I like it when thing seem easy  Uncle Michael and two of his friend meet u at the American Girl Place  CJ  be give the pink  glittery birthday crown that he have be wait  and nothairchalking  for  American Girl Julie also get a crown  And  they both get a sticker that say \u201c Happy Birthday  \u201d We be seat at our table for 10  This be where our crowd really go wild  Everybody who bring a doll get a high chair for their doll so that all doll join u at the table  If you didn \u2019 t bring a doll  you could borrow one from the Caf\u00e9 \u2019 s shelf  CJ  have me borrow Ivy  She be Julie \u2019 s BFF and he want the girl to be together at his party  But  he also want to spend some time with Isabelle  the 2014 American Girl of the Year  So  he let  make  Uncle Michael borrow Isabelle  So  there we be  10 human and six doll  The server walk over to greet u and say happy birthday to CJ  Then  she say  \u201c What do the birthday girl want to drink  \u201d CJ  look at me  wide eyed  I put my hand on his arm and say \u201c The birthday boy would like an Arnold Palmer \u201d \u201c Oh  I \u2019 m so sorry  \u201d the server say  Out come our drink and each doll get a tiny teacup and saucer  CJ  and Marie smile and squeal  Out come our appetizer  All

This be get exhaust  I usually don \u2019 t speak for him so often  but I wasn \u2019 t go to let anything dampen his day  We eat  The doll ate  The cake be place in front of CJ  and we sing Happy Birthday  He lean back  draw in a breath  his cheek puff out  be begin to blow and  then  he stop suddenly  \u201c Oh  I need a minute  I didn \u2019 t make a wish  \u201d he say with concern  Pink candle be melt onto the pink and white cake  I be fight the urge to rush him  He must have come up with something  because he blow out the candle and we erupt in applause  My boy beam  There \u2019 s a holder for your doll in the bathroom stall so that she can watch you pee  Not weird at all  After lunch we enter the twostory American Girl Store and CJ  be more overwhelmed than I have ever see him  There be so much to look at and so much he want  We stop by the doll hospital  where you could check your doll in for healing  repair   We visit the doll salon where doll be get elaborate updos  Uncle Michael in particular be fascinate by this section of the store and snap pic with his phone  Then  a moment that CJ  have be wait for arrive  Julie get in line to get her ear pierce  You can watch your doll get her hair do  but you can \u2019 t watch her get her ear pierce  I \u2019 ve heard that \u2019 s because they use a drill to make hole in her head and that would prove traumatize for child  I haven \u2019 t share this information with CJ  I stand with him in the wait area and when Julie be present to u with small shiny star in her ear  he be all happiness  Uncle Michael spoil him with the American Girl gymnastics equipment set  KK and Saige buy him a skirt  Uncle Michael \u2019 s friend buy him and Julie a white dog name Coconut  and I buy him a wheelchair for his doll  Presumably to use a she recover from some injury incur on the gymnastics set \u2013 although  once home  he put Julie in the wheelchair and push her down the stair  more than once or 15 time   The American Girl Place be overwhelm for all of u and we weren \u2019 t disappoint to leave after three hour  CJ  fell asleep in the car a we head home to celebrate the big \u201c 7 \u201d with Matt  Chase and my parent  He continue to luck out in the gift department  He want Monster High doll and Lego Friends sets\u2026and he get them  When I go to work on Monday morning a coworker ask me if
