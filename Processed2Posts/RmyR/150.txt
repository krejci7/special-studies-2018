the jump to tackle football with pad  and a much high registration fee and time commitment   Tackle football make me nervous  but I \u2019 m be tell on a weekly basis that it \u2019 s uncool for him to play flag football much longer  Tackle football be where it \u2019 s at if you be serious about pigskin andor your social status  In preparation for this next phase of Chase \u2019 s athletic career  we decide that he need to see tackle football live  not just on TV  so he can fully understand that he will be tackle and expect to tackle someone else  He \u2019 s such a kind  gentle  love soul and I \u2019 m afraid that the first time someone knock him to the ground in an act of aggression it \u2019 s go to shock the shit out of him  Matt find out that our high school alma mater be play a football game five minute from our house  so one recent Friday night we load in the car  grab hamburger for dinner and head to the stadium for the game  \u201c I don \u2019 t wan na watch football  Football be soooooo boring  \u201d CJ  complain  slump his shoulder and walk with dread through the parking lot  \u201c There will be cheerleaders\u2026 \u201d I say  \u201c I love cheerleader  Do we have to sit on the grass or be there a place for the audience to sit  \u201d CJ  ask  \u201c When you watch sport you \u2019 re a fan  not an audience  and you sit in the stand or the bleachers \u201d CJ  have a lot to learn to about sport  but isn \u2019 t the least bit interested in learn it  We walk into the stadium and CJ  saw the cheerleader instantly  They be stand on box with their name write on them  CJ   \u201c What \u2019 s her name  \u201d Me  \u201c Hannah \u201d CJ   \u201c What \u2019 s that one \u2019 s name  \u201d Me  \u201c Hannah \u201d CJ   \u201c What \u2019 s the brownhaired girl \u2019 s name  \u201d Me  \u201c Hannah \u201d CJ   \u201c That \u2019 s so many Hannahs  Do you have to be name Hannah to be a cheerleader  Cause my name \u2019 s not Hannah \u201d I agree  There be a lot of Hannahs  There be a lot of cheerleader  period  There be a lot of people  We have a hard time find seat  I look around  I lean over to Matt  \u201c I think it \u2019 s Homecoming  \u201d I say  \u201c Did you plan this a a romantic gesture for your high school sweetheart  \u201d He hadn \u2019 t  Whatever  CJ  watch the freshman  sophomore  junior varsity

select from the Star Trekthemed page of the band uniform catalogue  \u201c I wan na go home  \u201d he complain  \u201c We can \u2019 t leave yet  there be a halftime show and they be go to crown the Homecoming Queen  \u201d I say  \u201c THERES GOING TO BE A QUEEN     YOU DIDN \u2019 T TELL ME THERE WAS GOING TO BE A QUEEN    \u201d he yell  cause the two row in front of u to turn and look  \u201c WHERE IS SHE      \u201d he say stretch his head out and around to look for her  \u201c We don \u2019 t know who the queen be yet  They be go to bring out the princess and then announce which one be pick to be the queen  \u201d I whisper into his ear  \u201c THERE ARE PRINCESSES TOO      \u201d he yell  Again the row turn to look at u  He be nearly shake with excitement  The Dr Seuss halftime show start  Apparently it be Homecoming in Whoville  There be small skit  dance routine and then the five princess be load into a horsedrawn carriage and be make their way on the track around the football field towards u  \u201c HERE THEY COME  THEY \u2019 RE COMING     \u201d CJ  be lose his freaking mind  The princess take to the stage one at a time a their long list of accomplishment be read  One have  like  a 475 GPA  Is that even possible  I be always stoke to have above a 30  Each princess be station in front of a giftwrapped box  Each box contain a helium balloon and whomever \u2019 s balloon have a red paper heart attach to it be the queen  Simultaneously  the princess start to slowly lift the lid off of their box  CJ  have be hand clasp together and hold up to his heart  He be hold his breath  There be princess  gift box  balloon and heart  CJ  could not have be more in his element  The girl on the far left won  It be a beauty pageant moment  She bring her hand to her mouth in shock  She have a surprisedTaylorSwift face  The crown be place atop her shiny dark hair and a cape be drape on her slender shoulder  \u201c SHE CAN \u2019 T WIN       SHE DOESN \u2019 T HAVE THE BEST DRESS     THE GIRL OVER THERE WITH THE PINK GLITTER DRESS SHOULD BE THE QUEEN      \u201d CJ  be on his foot point firmly to the girl who \u2013 in his humble opinion \u2013 should be the Homecoming Queen  The two row in front of u turn to look again  I be hop that a smile would hide my embarrassment  I try to explain to CJ  that the Homecoming Queen be suppose to win base on her achievement  not her dress  He argue that that be stupid and that it should be base on her dress  \u201c Are you ready to go  \u201d Matt ask me  We start to make our way down the stadium step  \u201c
