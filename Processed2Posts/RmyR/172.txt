lefthand corner  in case you didn \u2019 t recognize him  He be wear extra mascara that day  I \u2019 m sad and anxious  a I have be at the end of every one of CJ \u2019 s school year  I don \u2019 t know what to expect next  Who will his teacher be  Who will his classmate be  Who will accept his gender creativity  Who will make him feel small because he like girl stuff big time  CJ \u2019 s kindergarten year be amaze  His teacher  Ms Valentine  deserve much of the credit  She greet him on the first day with her big blue eye  perfect blonde hair  sweet smile and leopardprint shoe  She know who he be  He be the gender nonconforming boy  The boy who like girl stuff  The boy whose mom be sometimes see a a liability\u2026what  with her blog and all  Ms Valentine have  a I hop  read the letter that I write to her and post on my blog day before school start  She take it all in with an open heart and an open mind  I meet with her early on to talk about CJ  his gender nonconformity and how it all affect his learning and time at school  She be kind  optimistic and excite to have him in her class  CJ  be safe in her care  I know it from moment number one  \u201c Does my teacher know that I like girl stuff  \u201d CJ  ask every day for week lead up to the first day of school and for a few week after it start  \u201c Ms  Valentine  Yes  baby  she know  \u201d I reassure him  \u201c What do she say about it  \u201d \u201c She think it \u2019 s awesome \u201d CJ  smile that redhaired  frecklednose  dimpledcheek smile that always make me smile too  He love it when people know and accept that he be gender nonconforming  The first day of school  Ms Valentine start a new tradition of not line the student up by sex  There would be no \u201c boys \u2019 line \u201d or \u201c girl \u2019 line \u201d in CJ \u2019 s class  She wink at me  I smile and nod my head in gratitude  All of the other mom struggle with the concept  They have a hard time comprehend what be happen  If there wasn \u2019 t a line for girl and a line for boys how would anybody function  How would the kid walk into the classroom and around campus  How would the earth continue to spin  For the first week of school the other mom try to divide the line base on genitals every morning  And  every morning Ms Valentine would remind them that she be do thing differently this year  CJ  instantly felt safe in Ms Valentine \u2019 s presence  She have pretty hair  sassy shoe and she smell good  He be sell  That \u2019 s CJ  in the middle  Looks like he have fresh lowlights and a sleek blowout  He spend the year selfediting more than ever  Not prompt by anyone \u2014 not u  not Ms Valentine  It be totally his decision  I have be tell that gender nonconforming kid start to conform more once they enter kindergarten  CJ  do just that at school  At home he remain our sparkly son  In kindergarten  he draw himself a a boy for the first time in his life  He decide at the last minute not to wear his Rapunzel pajama on Pajama Day  He stop wear the necklace and bracelet that he bead in his free time  He do  however  continue to wear \u201c girl sock \u201d every day tuck into his \u201c girl shoes \u201d His Monster High lunchbox be thrash from a year of daily use  And  he get plenty of compliment the day he wear his purple  glitter Wicked tshirt to school  He hat the week when he be \u201c Special Bear \u201d Five day be all about him and he be suppose to share about himself  his family and his home life every day  He didn \u2019 t want to  He have his public self and his private self  Sometimes the two overlap  but sometimes he doesn \u2019 t want them to  And  that \u2019 s fine  He do  however  love the Mother \u2019 s Day fashion show when we get to walk the runway in his purple plaid shirt  magenta bow tie and pink boat shoe for everyone to see  It be his first legit catwalk and it felt like home  If you ask him  he \u2019 ll tell you that his favorite subject in kindergarten be play on the playground with his friend and do craft  It \u2019 s the academic portion of school that he struggle with  Old Mac CJ  make a farm  You see  when your focus be on selfediting and selfpreservation  learn your ABCs and 123s don \u2019 t seem important  He \u2019 s concern about be tease about like girl stuff and not about identify number one through 30 out of sequence  In the end he qualify to move on to first grade  He meet state requirement  but there be the option of have him repeat kindergarten  His dad and I have to struggle with the decision to push him onward and upward or hold him back  A mom who I meet through PFLAG tell me that her therapist believe that LGBTQ kid be usually a year behind their peer academically because they be have to deal with allconsuming social and life issue while stay on top of school work  It can seem overwhelming  I \u2019 ve also have people tell me that LGBTQ youth be typically more gifted than their peer  Who know who be right  In September CJ  will strut into first grade  into an unfamiliar classroom helm by a teacher who we do not know  Will she have an open heart and an open mind  That \u2019 s all we ask for  But  we \u2019 ve come to realize that those be two big thing to ask of someone  It shouldn \u2019 t be that way  but it be  Whoever CJ \u2019 s first grade teacher be  we hold out hope that she will be as great a Ms Valentine have be  We also hope that Ms Valentine have a bitchin \u2019 summer and that she \u2019 ll KIT  ", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
