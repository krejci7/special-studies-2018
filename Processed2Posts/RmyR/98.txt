shine a light on the homophobic  transphobic  insensitive  hateful and hurtful thing that some mom say during the meeting and show that as far a we have come in LGBTQ acceptance and equality  there be still much work to be do  And sometimes that work need to be do in heavy dos at place much closer to home than we \u2019 d like  Almost immediately  PTA mom from our school start comment  message and react viscerally on social medium  As they do  I star at the PTA tagline  Every child  One voice  I \u2019 m not convince that our PTA a a whole care about every child and some of the voice I hear that night be not voice I want speak on behalf of my child  That be say  of course I don \u2019 t think that every parent at our school and member of the PTA be transphobic or homophobic  That would be a silly assumption and one I never make  I hope that the PTA mom at my school will reread my original blog post when their feeling have subside and really take in and think about the word use at the meeting and the tone in which they be say  And  think about the word and tone use since then  \u201c I wasn \u2019 t at the meeting  but I talk to several other mom who be and  insert defensive comment here  \u2026 \u201d \u2013 PTA Mom I \u2019 m not interested in gossip  hearsay or what other mom be say behind my back  If you be not at the meeting  please do not contact me to defend the people who be in the room who use transphobic language  homophobic language andor hate speech  Think long and hard about the people you be defend and why  I \u2019 m open to conversation  but I \u2019 m not open to your take on a meeting for which you be not present  Instead  let \u2019 s talk about how we can make our school and community more welcoming and inclusive of all student  \u201c We have a great group of teacher  parent and a wonderful school \u201d \u2013 PTA Mom I \u2019 m sure that if you and your child be heteronormative  cisgender and posse no special or unique need outside of what the school and district be accustom to deal with  then you do view it a a wonderful school with a great group of teacher and parent  If that \u2019 s the case  please consider yourself lucky  To the mother who write this in particular  when both of our old child be in third grade at this school  mine suffer homophobic bullying and harassment to the point that he threaten suicide during winter break  His teacher  the administration at the time and the district handle the situation so horribly that we have to seek the service of a child advocate  contact the ACLU  submit a Uniform Complaint Form and have an official investigation launch  At the school last year  CJ  be bully in the boy \u2019 s bathroom by a group of boys intent on look at his genitalia to see if he have a penis or a vagina  It \u2019 s interest to note that parent be worried about my son use the girl \u2019 s restroom  which  again  he do not  for unfounded reason  yet my son have be harass by boy and make to feel unsafe in the boy \u2019 s bathroom  So  sometimes our school doesn \u2019 t seem wonderful to those of u who fall outside of what South Orange County perceive to be \u201c the norm \u201d Our family want nothing more than for the school to be a wonderful place for every student and thing be look up  CJ \u2019 s current teacher be beyond amaze and the new administration have be wonderfully supportive  Our school could be wonderful  and in many way it be  but it have work to do \u2014 a evidence at the PTA meeting  which this mom do not attend   \u201c I be there  and while I agree that there be a few loud mouth parent there  you need to know that at least one in particular have make loud mouth  insensitive remark about other issue  at PTA meeting and elsewhere \u201d \u2013 PTA Member So because that \u201c loudmouth  insensitive \u201d mom be an asshole all of the time I should excuse her  She get a free pas to say transphobic thing and use hate speech because she talk nastily about everything  No  Again  think about whom you be defend and make excuse for and why  Think about it this way  if a person of color have be in the room  would people have tolerate the \u201c loudmouth  insensitive \u201d mom make white supremacist comment  I mean  after all  \u201c that \u2019 s just how she is \u201d When we allow hate speech from one person on campus  we allow it from other people and the climate on campus suffers  \u201c You sat way in the back and if you would have stay after the meeting  you could have have a constructive conversation \u201d \u2013 PTA Mom The location of my seat should not matter and bear no importance  I walk in and simply take an empty seat  I leave immediately after the meeting to pick up my kid because I have to arrange childcare to be able to attend the meeting  People shouldn \u2019 t have to stay after the meeting to have a constructive conversation  And  if that be the case  then that time should be agendized and communicate to all member  parent  teacher  etc  I \u2019 m use to meeting where the constructive conversation take place during the allotted meeting time and bias opinion that be not relevant to the topic be share privately post meeting  if at all  All this drama have me really consider Atlanta private school for my son  I \u2019 m always up for constructive conversation  You can reach me at raisingmyrainbow  gmailcom  I \u2019 ve already have a really fruitful conversation with the one mom who contact me request to talk after read the post  \u201c You should have use this forum to educate \u201d \u2013 PTA Mom If by \u201c this forum \u201d you mean the online world  I \u2019 ve be educate people about childhood gender nonconformity and LGBTQ youth for four year  I encourage you to read my blog and book to learn more  If you mean that I should have use the PTA meeting a a forum to educate  I argue that that be not my role that night  I be there a a mom  not a the presenter or educator  I be there to listen and learn and when thing start to get out of hand  I know it be best for me to observe and not lash out with my initial reaction  \u201c None of those thing be say \u201d and \u201c I didn \u2019 t hear them \u201d \u2013 PTA Moms The thing that I write be say  Every single one of them  If you be at the meeting  you may not have hear everything  But  I can tell you that from where I sit I hear all of the thing that I write \u2013 and then some  When you have a child that be directly affect by the topic be discuss  you tend to listen very closely  a I do  I want to hear how people respond and react to this issue that my family deal with daily  I do not write in my blog post any comment that I hear outside of the public meeting \u2013 and those be much  much bad  \u201c You \u2019 re give the PTA and our school a bad name  \u201d \u2013 PTA Mom I argue that it \u2019 s not me who be give the PTA a bad name  but rather it be the mom who use transphobic  homophobic hate speech during the meeting and the peer who defend them then and have continue to defend them since who give our school and PTA a bad name  My post be not mean to be a referendum on the actual PTA organization  national  local or otherwise  For me  this horrible event could have happen anywhere  a church group  sport team  scout meeting  etc  The fact that it happen at a PTA meeting be just an example of this particular issue  That say  I do feel like our school \u2019 s chapter fail at the National PTA \u2019 s mission to connect all parent to their school community and encourage parent engagement  Tolerating behavior that alienate parent due to bias and prejudice have to be address  \u201c I for one will never again feel comfortable ask a question at a PTA meeting\u2026 I \u2019 m worry that people will not feel comfortable to ask questions \u201d \u2013 PTA Mom Instead of this all or nothing approach to speak out in PTA meeting  maybe you should take a minute to think about the thing you be say  the way you be say them  who be hear them and how they could be perceive  I teach my kid to think about what they \u2019 re go to say and always speak a if a person of every gender  ethnicity  religion  race  sex  disability and sexuality be in the room  You know  just to be respectful of others  Maybe you could try that  As adult  we can usually tell when a question be be ask out of sincere interest and when it be be ask skeptically  argumentatively and dismissively  I \u2019 ll meet with anyone from our school who have question that come from a place of want to learn about kid like my son  I \u2019 m serious  I \u2019 ll make time for every single family  do it confidentially  individually or in group and give you nothing but honesty  All you have to do be ask and show up with an open heart and open mind  A special thanks to the HRC  Welcoming Schools  PFLAG and the ACLU this past week  The support I \u2019 ve felt from these organization be tremendous and critical  Also  even though the presenter at the PTA meeting cite statistic gather and publish by GLSEN  he be not there a a representative of GLSEN  ",
