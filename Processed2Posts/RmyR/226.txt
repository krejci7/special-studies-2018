happen to me last week and my heart be still all warm inside  Popsicle Princesses My son be up in a tree house with a new friend he have meet just hour before  CJ  be wear a dress that have a big  full lilac skirt and a bodice make of black velvet with delicate purple and pink flower embroider on it  His new friend  CK  be wear the most amazing Cinderella knockoff I have ever see  complete with gathered tier and a sweetheart neckline  They be both barefoot with face stain from their homemade berry popsicle  They sit with their back to u two mom  They whisper to each other and giggled often  I could have die of happiness at the sight  CJ  and CK  both have old brother  who be approach the base of the tree house  CJ  hop up  throw open the white shutter and yell \u201c Hey  You boys  Stay out of our garden  \u201d \u201c Yeah  stay out of our garden  \u201d CK  yell from behind CJ  The white shutter slam shut and uncontrollable giggle waft over to the deck where I be sit  The old brother look at u mom and we just shrug  Yes  I think  stay out of their garden  stay out of their way  they be have the best day ever  A few week earlier  CK \u2019 s Mom have be look for play group in Orange County for gender nonconforming kid  there aren \u2019 t any  when she find my blog  What be the chance that we live just seven mile apart  We talk via phone  email  text and schedule a play date  I tell CJ \u2018 s Dad that we be off to play with a boy who like to play with girl stuff  leave the address of our destination and set out with managed expectation  Before I know it  the front door open and we walk into a house that be home to no girl  two boy  lot of pink  an enviable dressup collection and a fourfoothigh  multifloor  allpink castle  A pink princess tent take up most of the family room  Monster High Manicures CK  flit down the stair in a pink terrycloth sundress  CJ  look at me  I know what he be think and I nod and smile at him  silently acknowledge that  yes  he own the same exact dress in turquoise  CK  be petite  with olive skin  dark hair buzz for the hot day of summer and the sweet way about him  There \u2019 s an innocence about him that you want to protect and keep intact  Something about him ask politely to be treat delicately  and when you \u2019 re with him  you can \u2019 t imagine treat him any other way  The four brother start play immediately  CK  have request via text \u2014 because that \u2019 s how kid do it these day \u2014 that CJ  bring some \u201c girl stuff \u201d to play with  CJ  bring his lifesize plush ballerina doll  which be  1499 at Ralph \u2019 s in December and be quite a nappy embarrassment at this point   a Sleeping Beauty Barbie  who also look like she \u2019 s be through the ringer  and Ghoulia Yelps from Monster High  who lose her top sometime ago and usually have her red bowling short around her knee  but don \u2019 t you know her wedge sneaker be always perfectly in place    The two boy discuss in great detail My Little Pony  Care Bears and Strawberry Shortcake a the old brother spray each other in the face with the garden hose and chase each other with plastic snake  CK \u2019 s Mom and I compare our life  When do CK  start like \u201c girl stuff  \u201d Age two and a half or three  Same with CJ  Does CJ  like to dance  Oh  yes  CJ  wear a tutu to dance class   Yes  Can \u2019 t CK  No  How sad  We worry about the old brother  We worry about bully and we worry about school  Is it jar now for you to see him in boy clothes  Yes  Doesn \u2019 t it feel so much more natural to see them in feminine attire or do some thing feminine  Yes  We worry about who and when to tell that our son be gender nonconforming  Do you like the term gender nonconforming  How about gender creative  How about gender fluid  How about gender independent  How about gender identity disorder  No  Spending time with this family felt natural and easy  Over the course of our marathon  threehour playdate  which I assume would more closely resemble a 5K   CK  change once every hour  From pink terrycloth sundress to black leotard with tutu to fullon Cinderella ball gown to close the show  CJ  want in on the action  he want to slip out of his tiedyed rainbow shirt and into that lilac and velvet number he spy on CK \u2019 s miniature garment rack  Ever the gracious host  CK  show CJ  to a room where he could change in privacy  When CJ  emerge  all dolled up and glowing  CK  gasp out loud  \u201c CJ  you look beautiful  \u201d he say in sincere amazement  \u201c Thank you  \u201d CJ  say  He be try to be modest  but he be feel it  he felt beautiful  Shoe Sharing Sillies CK  offer CJ  some of his jewel  CJ  slide a heartshaped  pinkstoned ring onto his finger  CK  clip on chandelier earring and apply some Clinique lipstick  CJ  have serious 99 Cent Store earring envy  \u201c Man  I just can \u2019 t stop think about those earring  \u201d CJ  say later  on the way home  He be in the back seat with his leg cross  right over left  like my mother always tell me a lady should sit  \u201c Sometimes it \u2019 s hard not to think about something  \u201d I say  a I picture the two small boy make their way up to that tree house  with that garden that those pesky old brother wouldn \u2019 t stay out of  They be way up high  dress to the nine and my heart melt for my son in the late afternoon sun     Other thing you should be read this week  Pretty In Pink  An article by an amazing dad of a gender nonconforming son  It beg the question I \u2019 ve be ask a lot lately\u2026Does stand up for human decency make a person an activist  What \u2019 s So Bad About a Boy Who Wants to Wear a Dress   My answer be \u201c nothing  \u201d of course\u2026Nothing at all be bad about a boy who want to
