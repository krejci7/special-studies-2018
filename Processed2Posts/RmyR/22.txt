message from people ask where our son \u2019 s father be  a though I couldn \u2019 t possibly be around and still allow a male son to display female behavior  To those people I say  I \u2019 m right here father my son  I want to love him  not change him  My son skipping and twirling in a dress isn \u2019 t a sign that a strong male figure be miss from his life  to me it \u2019 s a sign that a strong male figure be fully vest in his life and commit to protect him and allow him to grow into the person who he be create to be  I may be a \u201c guy \u2019 s guy  \u201d but that doesn \u2019 t mean that my son have to be  \u2014 Matt What do I expect when I be pregnant and learn I be have another boy  More of the same  Life on repeat  A life of handmedowns \u2014 everything from clothes to toy to hobby  When CJ start show u that he be differently gendered  I grow frustrate and scar  He wasn \u2019 t a card I expect to be dealt  But  a Cheryl Strayed say  \u201c you don \u2019 t have a right to the card you believe you should have be dealt  You have an obligation to play the hell out of the one your holding \u201d I \u2019 m hold CJ  A child with special and unique need because of his gender expression and gender identity  Because he be a boy who be a girl at heart  And  because of what the future could very well hold for him  And  you know what  I \u2019 m go to play the hell out of this fabulous  unexpected card I be dealt  I \u2019 m go to love him  support him  encourage him  build him up and let him soar  I \u2019 m go to hustle for him and kid like him  Don \u2019 t sit at the table star at what you think be a shitty hand  start rearrange those card and make plan to play the hell out of them  It \u2019 s your obligation  Own it  Me  What \u2019 s this  CJ  The cover of the new comic book I \u2019 m writing  Me  How and why do RuPaul save the day  CJ  I \u2019 m not go to tell you yet  But  let \u2019 s just say it have something to do with Jinkx Monsoon  a couture gown and grape juice  Her  We \u2019 re have a gender reveal  Me  No  you \u2019 re have a genitalia reveal  Parentstobe CAN \u2019 T reveal their unborn baby \u2019 s gender  In general  gender be what \u2019 s in a person \u2019 s head that tell them that they \u2019 re male or female  or both or neither or some unique combination   A child \u2019 s concept of gender start to develop around age three  So  a child \u2019 s third or fourth birthday would be a good time for parent to host a gender reveal  Parentstobe CAN reveal their unborn baby \u2019 s sex  In general  sex be what \u2019 s between a person \u2019 s legs that tell them they \u2019 re male or female  That \u2019 s what \u2019 s truly reveal at a gender reveal  The fetus \u2019 s sex  Its genitals  Its penis or vagina   Or both if the baby be intersex   When I attend gender reveal party and the parentstobe yell \u201c It \u2019 s a boy   \u201d I want to yell back \u201c The baby have a penis  \u201d When they shout  \u201c It \u2019 s a girl   \u201d I want to shout \u201c The baby have a vagina  \u201d It \u2019 s amaze how fast time move when you \u2019 re watch kid grow  The human who make me a mother be 14 year old today  He ask for an electric guitar and spend the weekend a a production assistant on a music video set in Los Angeles  I \u2019 d never ask for him to stop grow \u2014 the alternative be my bad fear  I just wish I could slow thing down a bit  get him to hug me a little long and not be in such a damn hurry to be the amazing man he \u2019 s destine to be  Shoe shop with CJ be not fun  His foot be super narrow  One foot be half a size big than the other  He \u2019 s right smackdab in the middle of little kid and big kid size  Oh  and sometimes he want shoe from the girl \u2019 section and sometimes he doesn \u2019 t  But the shoe in the boy \u2019 section be \u201c too serious \u201d and \u201c no fun \u201d Our triedandtrue solution  Buy plainish shoe and customize them  We get shoe from Nordstrom Rack and add velvet shoelace by Aldo  a different color for each shoe  of course   Then  we add silver star and lighten bolt sticker patch from The Trend bar  Young CJ  I \u2019 m go to go dress up like a superhero  Me  Cool  Young CJ  Okay  I \u2019 m dress  Now take a picture of how superhero I be  I think he \u2019 d never be a reader  It didn \u2019 t come easy to him  And  in first grade  his teacher teach him that there be \u201c boy book \u201d and \u201c girl books \u201d Teachers  please don \u2019 t do that  Then  when he start read the Dork Diaries series  kid at school make fun of him for read \u201c girl \u2019 books \u201d Now  in fourth grade  he doesn \u2019 t care what people say about the book he choose  Lately he \u2019 s be tear through gymnast biography  \u201c People at school think I \u2019 m a lady anyway  So  they don \u2019 t care what I read \u201d That time CJ discover the \u201c big eye \u201d art of Margaret Keane and be so inspired that he do his makeup to look like a bigeyed waif from one of her painting  ", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Raising My Rainbow"}
