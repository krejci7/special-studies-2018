I guess something I want to talk about a little more  that I \u2019 ve be think about a lot lately  um  I guess  in term of reality check about what  what surgery might end up be like  Um\u2026 nerve damage  That \u2019 s not fun  It really do not seem like that big of a deal to me  when I be  um  look into surgery  I read all my side effect  sign all my paper  go to the doctor\u2026 I do everything right  everyone tell me what be what gon na happen  Um  but  if you don \u2019 t have  like  nerve damage\u2026 I mean any medical thing  anything you haven \u2019 t experience yet  you don \u2019 t really know what it \u2019 s like  But specifically right now  I \u2019 m talk about like\u2026 if you don \u2019 t have nerve damage  you don \u2019 t really know what that \u2019 s like  you don \u2019 t know what you \u2019 re sign up for  Um\u2026 it \u2019 s pretty distress to have an area of your body where you use to feel something\u2026 feel dead  I mean  it feel the same a like\u2026 when your mouth be numb  Sometimes  Sometimes it hurt like hell  And that \u2019 s the other thing be it \u2019 s like  it \u2019 s all over the place  Um  it \u2019 s really really weird to go from have normal sensation on a part of your body  to be  you know  drug to sleep and wake up  and then go forward  for year go forward  you have no sensation  or pain  or no sensation mix with pain  or like dead and pain  it \u2019 s just  it \u2019 s crazy  It \u2019 s really hard to describe  In term of like what sensation feel like  nerve damage kind of feel like it \u2019 s like  off the sensation spectrum  like it \u2019 s not really a kind of feeling I have consider exist before  Um  and you know\u2026 when I be with someone else who be trans  who I felt really comfortable with  who be get a mastectomy  like  my chest be able I be able to experience my chest a a part of our like  you know  intimacy together  A lot of other thing go wrong in that relationship  but I do experience my chest  a a a part of my sexuality  And that \u2019 s very weird  to go from have something\u2026 potentially  with the right person you feel really really comfortable with  in term of those issue  be a part of my sexuality  versus feel dead  it feel dead  or painful  Um\u2026 so yeah  and you know  I think anything be good than what I have  But you know  I wasn \u2019 t super realistic about how top surgery turn out when you \u2019 re not  you know  the \u201c right \u201d size  My surgeon\u2026 my surgeon tell me  the same a if someone be much small than me or you know  whatever if someone was the \u201c right \u201d size for a surgery like this  Um\u2026 I really  I really didn \u2019 t know what that would mean  Not that I think I \u2019 d feel any good about my chest  if it look super symmetrical and everything  I don \u2019 t think that I would  But I mean  it do kind of strike me that  you know  I wasn \u2019 t expect this  even though by any reasonable measure  I should have be  I \u2019 d see picture of people who have have surgery with  you know  I \u2019 d like  like  32DDs  and I wasn \u2019 t super really thin  you know  kind of\u2026 regular  So\u2026 I don \u2019 t know  I think that \u2019 s another element that demonstrate kind of how  you can go into this and sign everything and say all the right word  and not really have it be real to you  what the actual result might be  And my nipples whew  Oh my goodness  Yikes  Um\u2026 they still look like scar tissue  it \u2019 s be like three year  and they still be like\u2026 you know they \u2019 re not really perfectly round  they \u2019 re kind of\u2026tore up  you know  they kind of look\u2026 I don \u2019 t know  They don \u2019 t look\u2026 nothing look the way I think it would  And I didn \u2019 t have any real good reason to think it would look that way  either  I be just  you know  I wasn \u2019 t be realistic with myself  I would say all the right word  but inside  I wasn \u2019 t really realistic with myself  And you know  nipple sensation  Whew  You know  that \u2019 s\u2026 I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s come back  Um  I have almost no feeling and what I do have be pain  and it feel  it just feels nasty  it feel crazy  And it just bring up  you know  all the other feeling about my chest  Um\u2026 like you know  there \u2019 s little pocket on the front of your shirt  When I \u2019 m wear TWO shirt  I love put shit in my front pocket  Super convenient  I work at a job where there \u2019 s a bunch of key  so I can keep my key in the front pocket  Uh\u2026 keep my phone in the front pocket  And then summer come and I \u2019 m wear one shirt  and I put  and I try to put something in the front pocket on my tshirt  and it \u2019 s like oh shit  because it \u2019 s like on my nipple  and it just feels horrible  So then every time I go to put my phone away  I \u2019 m like I \u2019 m attention deficit  real attention deficit  and so I just forget all fucking day  So I \u2019 m constantly be remind that you know  you can \u2019 t use the front pocket of your shirt  or else you \u2019 ll have to think about your fuck chest all day  Um\u2026 yeah\u2026 um  you know\u2026 it \u2019 s not symmnetrical  I \u2019 m off testosterone now  I have be for like a year  and tissue \u2019 s kind of come back there a little bit  you know  because whenever it doesn \u2019 t generally come back until your weight start shift around  but I guess mine be now  a little bit  because my chest have a little bit more  like  breast kind of tissue  and then\u2026 um\u2026 and it \u2019 s super weird  because the new tissue have normal feeling  but the old tissue doesn \u2019 t\u2026 like  a lot of it be still nerve damagey\u2026 I don \u2019 t know it \u2019 s just  It \u2019 s crazy  I don \u2019 t know how to describe nerve damage  Super weird though  And if you know  it turn out that this isn \u2019 t something you have\u2026 easy feeling about  nerve damage sure a shit doesn \u2019 t help with that  damn  It so super do not help  Um\u2026 so yeah  I guess  just want to talk about that  basically  Um\u2026 just want to talk about how thing can turn out  because this be a reality  be that  there be nothing before I transition that would have clearly distinguish me from anyone else  That \u2019 s  I mean  my gender therapist be  be experience  and have a lot of  you know  have a lot of experience with this stuff  with a lot of people  and we \u2019 ve talk about how this all turn out for me  I don \u2019 t see a gender therapist anymore  whoo  I don \u2019 t see any therapist  damn  hoo  Um\u2026 but I email with my gender therapist  and we talk about this  and I don \u2019 t think my gender therapist know this be something that could happen to me  either  I don \u2019 t think anyone knew  And that \u2019 s kind of the problem  I mean  at the very least  people should be aware that this be how it can turn out  that you can end up year into it  year into it  you can realize\u2026 hey  um\u2026 I \u2019 m a fucking lesbian  and I really fuck up  And now  you know  I have to live with that  And that \u2019 s  this be where  you know and there \u2019 s  you know  there \u2019 s way to move forward from it  there \u2019 s talk about your feeling  there \u2019 s connect with other people  there \u2019 s plenty of thing you can do  but\u2026 I would not wish this on anyone  It would have be a LOT easy to not have that surgery  I really would have do myself some favor with THAT  Um\u2026 so yeah  Um\u2026 well  bye  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 BORN WRONG"}
