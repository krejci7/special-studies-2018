"tags": ["Uncategorized"], "text": "Lately  when I get really wind up about my mastectomy  there be some recur question I get stick on  Normally  they \u2019 re recur obsessive thought  The long I think about them  the more upset I get  Luckily  my attention span and shortterm memory both get a lot bad over the last few year  so normally I just distract myself a necessary when I feel like I have to think about anything  But if I \u2019 m badly upset around someone I feel comfortable vocalize this stuff to  which be vanishingly rare  I sob an awful lot and tend to repeat a few different question with very noisy terror  They \u2019 re not really the kind of thing anyone else can answer for me  I don \u2019 t think  I \u2019 ll probably make a post about each of my question eventually  I \u2019 m gon na go a little bit into my best guess at where these phrase I repeat be come from  The way I talk about my own chest shouldn \u2019 t be read a feeling or judgement I have about anyone else postop  just to be clear  It \u2019 s be a long time since I have issue with externalize my body issue and think nasty shit about others \u2019 appearance  This be 100  about my trauma  not the aesthetic result of this surgery or define anyone else \u2019 s experience with transitional surgery  That be said\u2026 here \u2019 s the post  \u201c WHO \u2019 S GOING TO LOVE ME NOW  \u201d I actually be well aware that a lot of people love me at this point in my life  mostly other woman  and I \u2019 m endlessly grateful for the many positive relationship I \u2019 m able to be a part of  On the surface this should be easy to talk myself down from  since there \u2019 s a lot of example of who do love me now  It \u2019 s not exactly about that  though  What I really mean be just that I feel like a repulsive freak when I see or remember what exist now where my breast be  As a result of that  I don \u2019 t feel like anyone could really love me ever again  I know this be irrational  There \u2019 s a couple direction where it come from  One of them be horror at the knowledge of what action be perform to change my body from how it be to how it be now  I get very distressed when I see footage  illustration  or detailed description of surgery  I do even before I have it  I can only watch the absolute fake movie gore without freak out the rest of the day about it  Even in cartoon  watch harm be do to live creature  or corps  actually  although that \u2019 s not pertinent here  upset me  Like  a a child I use to be pretty troubled by Loony Tunes drop anvil on people  I empathize with corps  too  to the extent where I couldn \u2019 t participate in my 10th grade fetal pig dissection  I couldn \u2019 t make myself cut into something that still look alive to me  The winter before my transition  when I be visit my  also FTM  we end up get our mastectomy a couple week apart  partner in Canada  I remember how M like to play through instructional surgery game on a smartphone  I try to play the rhinoplasty one once out of morbid curiosity  didn \u2019 t finish  and still have intrusive thought about the cartoon graphic year later  After that  when M have those game open  I would make a point not to look  Until my consult  I have successfully avoid think very much about how you go from have breast to not have breast  I have obsessively research every aspect of transition but I \u2019 d always skip over actual description of surgery  To his credit  Dr Crane do make me listen to a frank description of what double mastectomy entail  even though I say I would rather not hear it  I felt like I shouldn \u2019 t have to I \u2019 d be unconscious for it  He say it be important to know what you \u2019 re get into  Fair enough  I still hate him  What I remember of the description he give be that for each breast  they make an incision on the top of the breast itself  and then an incision beneath it  Everything between those two incision get cut away  They cut a hole in the tissue of the upper flap so that they can reattach the nipple  which they snip away from all the rest of my breast tissue  which they \u2019 re just gon na toss  The upper and low flap be stitch together  The stitch dissolve  I think  I would have remember them be take out  I would hope  I \u2019 ve be scar of stitch my whole life  Surgical glue be use along with the stitch to minimize scarring  After that  they cut slit in the side to put the draining tube into  The drain fill with pu  I think   It be yellow  and blood  Little chunk of tissue aren \u2019 t unusual  I get a paper say how much blood and pu  probably  I should expect  You empty the drain every few hours\u20263 or 6 or something  god  I don \u2019 t remember  You come back in some number of day to get the drain take out  After some other number of day  they take the cast off  I can \u2019 t remember which come first  M be the last operation Dr Crane do drain on  by the way  2 week after my operation  At least that \u2019 s what he tell u  Now Crane be the guy who doesn \u2019 t need to do drain  Anyway\u2026 my memory be shit and I \u2019 ve be actively repress this for year  so I would be very surprised if what I remember of him describe his operation be entirely accurate  Sequencing isn \u2019 t intuitive to me at the best of time but it \u2019 s one of many thing that go totally to shit when I \u2019 m upset  which I be  because think about this be upset  I make myself look at my chest in the mirror a lot after surgery  with the cast on and after it be off  I don \u2019 t remember how it make me feel  The other angle on why feel like my body be disgust upset me be broad  more about transition a a whole than the more episodic trauma of surgery  Growing up a a butch lesbian have already make me feel pretty monstrous  I think transition would deliver me from that  turn an unlovable girl into a lovable man  It didn \u2019 t work I have never be a man and never will be  Grieving this broad disappointment be pretty tie up in grieve the failure of my mastectomy to give me a chest that I could feel good about without have to do a shit ton of emotional work to get there  I think I be take a shortcut  In reality  I be use all of my notably limited emotional  physical  and financial resource to stomp in the opposite direction with great enthusiasm  It doesn \u2019 t feel good to think about this  Sunk cost fallacy and transition  especially transitional surgery  should probably be a whole separate post  though  because that be some real fuckin shit  ",
