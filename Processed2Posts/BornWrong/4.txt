all  the article  I don \u2019 t really feel like link it sorry  absolutely could have be bad  I understand that when you talk to a journalist  you lose control of the narrative to a significant degree  and we willingly sign up for that  It be a gamble and the outcome be middle  where \u201c good \u201d be Katie Herzog \u2019 s article and \u201c really bad \u201d be a Daily Mail shock piece  I wouldn \u2019 t highly recommend medium contact with Charlotte McCann to anyone in detransition community  even so  Making yourself that vulnerable on a very public scale isn \u2019 t worth it for a \u201c could be bad \u201d article  It \u2019 s worth it for a genuinely good one  I \u2019 m not try to stop people from share it or anything  I \u2019 m really glad others be find value in it and if I be able to be more objective  I might like it more  but some of the stuff that bother me feel really personal and be hard to be perfectly diplomatic about  Honestly  I really like Charlie  too  Would absolutely still recommend her a a house guest  The photographer be totally cool to work with  too  super nice about our various neurosis  Anyway  this response be mainly for talk about with people who know me personally  so that I don \u2019 t have to keep explain everything I find frustrating  and for myself  so that I stop recite in my head everything that \u2019 s bug me about that article  Our house be not a trash hoard  in case you be wonder  We have some thrifted painting and ceramic that apparently some people might think belong in garbage can  Fair enough  different stroke  but I would have appreciate clear language there  \u201c Full of junk \u201d imply our house wasn \u2019 t clean  It be  The guy who die a few month ago  the one I be support at work whose picture be on my wall  isn \u2019 t any type of Asian  and neither of u ever say he be  He be Alaska Native  I \u2019 m assume she just guess base on the photo  If a reporter be go to describe someone I care a lot about  whose death really mess with me  with very little information other than his race  it feel to me like it wouldn \u2019 t be that hard to ask where his family be from  Honestly  this be what \u2019 s bother me the most and probably a big reason why I \u2019 m feeling so cranky about the whole article  I work really hard to meet his need and advocate for his right when he be alive  but now he \u2019 s dead  and there really isn \u2019 t anything I can do about it  It suck  Feeling like his picture on our wall be be use a a vehicle to make some weird assumption about me and my partner \u2019 s life  and have disrespectful assumption about his race thrown in  be pretty shitty  My face be never sharp  I \u2019 ve be at least kind of fat as long a I be on testosterone  I have more masculine facial fat distribution when I be on HRT  but \u201c sharp \u201d be a serious stretch  Anyway  I didn \u2019 t show her any picture of myself on testosterone  Since neither of u say my face be ever sharp and we never show her any picture  I find that comment weird  My skin wasn \u2019 t rough  either  I get cold easy now because testosterone make your skin thicker  I haven \u2019 t notice my skin feeling softer  just the difference in cold sensitivity  Again  weird  since we didn \u2019 t say it and I feel like I would remember this lady have touch my skin a couple year back  I be diagnose a ADD and bipolar three or four year ago  not exactly recently  \u201c FTMTF \u201d be not how I understand myself  I \u2019 m actually pretty sure I recall the term come up  and u say something along the line of  we don \u2019 t know anyone who use that language for herself and we don \u2019 t feel it \u2019 s accurate  I be really  really clear that I have be female this whole time  I have never use that term for myself and actually find it pretty distasteful  I felt the offandon he pronoun thing be gimmicky  distracting  and inaccurate  Like\u2026 the sentence \u201c When Max be 19  just over three year after he come out a transgender  she realise he \u2019 d make a mistake \u201d  Geez  I \u2019 m actually one person  Just the one  I don \u2019 t feel separate myself into at least two  if not more  be actually gon na do me any favor  I didn \u2019 t use male pronoun for myself at any point in our conversation  I be very clear that I have be a girlwoman and a lesbian the entire time  I notice at another point in the article  when describe a theoretical \u201c preeverything \u201d three year old ostensibly begin identify a a transgender girl  the preferred pronoun of that hypothetical toddler be use  In contrast  I be refer to a male intermittently throughout  although I be super clear about not identify that way  Just something I notice  We do talk about this before the article come out Charlie ask me how I felt about it  I express that I hat it and why  she say that she could try to talk to her editor if I absolutely insist but she firmly believe that would ruin the story  At that point I repeat that I hat it but that obviously  she be the journalist here and it be her call  Which it be  I request that  in spite of the pronoun switching  she make it clear that I believe I have be female the whole time  that transition happen to me a a girl and a a woman  She assure me this would be clear  I don \u2019 t feel that \u201c Max be a woman and have be one for two year \u201d communicate this at all  In fact  it specifically communicate the opposite  \u201c Max detransitioned for several reason  the most significant one be that she be not transgender \u201d be an oversimplification that I specifically address during our interview  I tell her that while transition  I be as transgender a anyone else  that there \u2019 s no single part of my experience that apply only to woman who would eventually detransition  that everything you could pick out a a reason why I \u201c wasn \u2019 t ever trans \u201d be something that apply to a bunch of people who haven \u2019 t stop identify a trans  I say that by some definition  I still be transgender  although I don \u2019 t describe myself that way  I pass a male frequently  I \u2019 m butch  I have issue with people feel my legal sex doesn \u2019 t match my appearance  I tell her I still experience the feeling that motivate me to transition  and that I don \u2019 t see an inherent difference between me and those who continue transition  Kitty and I explain that we feel transition be one strategy for cop with dysphoria  but that both of u now utilize other strategy  I do not feel that any of these nuance be convey  The reporter only spend time in our living room and bathroom  where we don \u2019 t have any picture of ourselves up  There \u2019 s actually a bunch of picture  include both of u and many of our friend  by our kitchen table  on our cork board  She never ask about this and it never come up  as far a I remember  Kinda make all the extrapolation about why we don \u2019 t have those picture up seem silly  Basically  reading this article make me feel like a lot of what I say in that interview wasn \u2019 t actually hear  I \u2019 m have a hard time be objective about it  That be say  I still hope it can do some good  and I feel this be a productive learning experience for me and my partner  ", "feedtitle": "BORN WRONG"}
