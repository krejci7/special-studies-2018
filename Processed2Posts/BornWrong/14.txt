"tags": ["Uncategorized"], "text": "Despite the many massive and immediately obvious difference between the two  I think suicide contagion and how that spread be relevant to discussion of social contagion a a trigger for transition  Both be drastic strategy generally employ  at least in part  a an attempt to alleviate acute dissatisfaction with one \u2019 s life  I struggle with a drive to commit suicide for a long time and still have issue with suicidal ideation at time  My transition be motivate in part by my belief that it would make me less suicidal  In term of suicide contagion  the role of preexist vulnerability be acknowledge a a necessary causal factor for suicide contagion to impact someone  In term of suicide contagion  it \u2019 s not just like it \u2019 s actually just a result of see something on tv or whatever  What happen be that see suicide discuss in certain way can function a a trigger event for lifeending self harm behavior  in the context of someone \u2019 s current situation  While transition be not inherently lifeending by any mean  the rise in incidence a it presence on mainstream and social medium rise indicate that social contagion be probably a factor at play here  Here \u2019 s some further thought on that  Another similar feature be the possibility of \u201c mass cluster \u201d of suicide  as well a \u201c point cluster \u201d of suicide occur on a small scale  These be pattern that many of u have see with transition  From the abstract for \u201c The Clustering and Contagion of Suicide \u201d  Two general type of suicide cluster have be discuss in the literature  roughly  these can be classify a mass cluster and point cluster  Mass cluster be medium relate  and the evidence for them be equivocal  point cluster be local phenomenon  and these do appear to occur  Contagion have not be conceptually well developed nor empirically well support a an explanation for suicide cluster  An alternative explanation for why suicide sometimes cluster be articulate  People who be vulnerable to suicide may cluster well before the occurrence of any overt suicidal stimulus  and when they experience severe negative event  include but not limited to the suicidal behavior of one member of the cluster  all member of the cluster be at increase risk for suicidality  a risk that may be offset by good social support   On a local scale  many of u involve in trans community have watch \u201c point cluster \u201d structured explosion of transition within a social group happen right in front of u  I know I \u2019 ve watch friend group go from have a couple trans people to entirely transidentified  online many time and once in person  This also appear to be occur on a \u201c mass cluster \u201d like scale\u2026 here \u2019 s a graphic an online news site post in an article speaking positively about transition  show the rise in referral to the only clinic in England handle pediatric transition  If you view transition a exclusively positive  this rise in it incidence be a good thing  As someone who experience transition a an effort to medically \u201c correct \u201d me a an underage traumatize butch lesbian with a learning disability  though  I have a hard time believe that no one else be go to be hurt by this  I seek transition because I could see no other way to move forward  Have all 1398 of these child and adolescent be make aware of other way to cope with these feeling  involve few medical risk and no ongoing reliance on synthetic hormone  Were their struggle all see and respect before they pursue transition  Are they all cognitively develop enough to make fully educate choice when it come to decision that may affect their body in huge way for the rest of their life  I doubt this very much  Anyways here \u2019 s the aspect of medium report that the CDC cite a contribute to suicide contagion  Presenting simplistic explanation for suicide Providing sensational coverage of suicide Reporting \u201c howto \u201d description of suicide Presenting suicide a a tool for accomplish certain end Glorifying suicide or person who commit suicide Focusing on the suicide completer \u2019 s positive characteristic As a thought experiment  replace \u201c suicide \u201d with \u201c transition \u201d in each of these \u201c don \u2019 t \u201d  Does that not describe how transition be frequently discuss  both intercommunity and to an increase degree  even in medium outside the community  Obviously there \u2019 s a ton of medium against transition  too\u2026 but everyone in the world be also saturate with medium that  in term of explicit message  if not how it treat people struggle  generally discourage suicide  in a range of way with very diverse level of empathy and potential helpfulness to a suicidal person   In light of that  I don \u2019 t think the existence of a shit ton of transpeoplehating medium wholly invalidate the comparison  Another important note  suicide contagion be generally see a most likely to occur when a vulnerable population feel they have a lot in common with the deceased  I feel that this fit the pattern I \u2019 ve see in trans communities people seem more likely to consider transition when someone who they previously view a \u201c the same \u201d a them begin transition  For example  I know several butch woman who have talk about transition spread through friend group formerly compose exclusively of woman who know themselves a butch lesbian  Here \u2019 s something else about suicide contagion  there be community response that can mitigate it impact  In term of suicide  the focus be fully on prevention  This isn \u2019 t directly analogous to transition  I don \u2019 t think the focus should truly be to prevent transition  For one thing  this would imply a lack of support for those who have already transition  a group I \u2019 m visibly a part of  As long a transition be available  some of u will choose it  and that doesn \u2019 t mean they \u2019 re any less human or deserving of support  Withdrawing support upon transition also make it less likely for individual to feel that stop transition be an option  However  I do feel that effort should be make to communicate that transition be not the only option when it come to cop with a drive to transition  This isn \u2019 t common knowledge  Support for woman cop with rejection relate to gender noncompliance  alienation from their body  distress at be see a female  and other experience often cod a inherently trans should be widely available  whether or not those experience be a part of a trans identity for the individual suffering  These be female experience and should be decouple from transition narrative to a high degree  while still allow trans individual to recognize them a a part of their story  Resources on all of the different way different individual have manage to handle what would be diagnose a GID or gender dysphoria  without further reliance on medical intervention  should be broadly available  especially in community where a reduction of social restraint on transition have take place  If transition be suppose to be a choice  there have get to be other option  Doing something because you believe it \u2019 s the only way to avoid eventually kill yourself isn \u2019 t really the same a make a free choice  Whether it help you or not  medical transition expose you to a shit ton of risk  There be low risk option that  for many of u  work an awful lot well  Would point cluster of transition occur with the same frequency if sensitive  unbiased support system that acknowledge these feeling do not inherently necessitate transition  be make available to those struggle  Would mass cluster  I don \u2019 t know for sure  It \u2019 s worth note that  in the year I \u2019 ve spent in detransitionreconciling community  I \u2019 ve never see a bunch of u return to a trans identity at once  This have be true  as far a I \u2019 ve see  even though some individual do return to transition  and everyone in these circle have previously consider herself trans in some way  I believe our resilience to intercommunity transition spike be heighten in this community because  by virtue of be connect to each other  we can freely process the way it make u feel when someone we feel we have a lot in common with return to a cop mechanism that we know have do u harm  Naming our feeling and work with each other to identify way to move forward probably make u less likely to rely on objectively higherrisk strategy  This be not something that many woman have  but I feel that it \u2019 s something all woman deserve  to the extent that they can participate without harm others   We can \u2019 t find out if anyone would choose transition freely until everyone know it \u2019 s not their only option  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 BORN WRONG"}
