really lucky that  when my dissociative defense start gradually crumble around me  other woman have already be organize around the experience of stop transition other woman who have live it  If it wasn \u2019 t for the community that exist because of their hard work  I doubt I would have stop transition any time soon  The alternative to community create \u201c for u  by u \u201d look a lot gnarlier to me than continue to pretend I be a man on the inside  For example  my main exposure to criticism of transition  while I be transition  be a certain blogger who love to post photo roundup of unfortunate FTM soul  Seeing postop picture of actual people \u2019 s actual chest and genitals  that they live with every day  share nonconsensually  yeah  they be already online  but they be sensitive picture not share with any intention of be consume a antitrans medium  strongly reinforce the hyperbolic description of radical feminist that I be already hear from the trans community  I read this content compulsively anyway  It cause emotional flashback to extreme shame and self hatred  In response to that level of desperation  my drive to transition felt even more immense  When I be transition  I know a lot of other FTMs who would compulsively trigger themselves use the same blog  None of u stop transition a a result of it  either  We just cry a lot about it  The value of community and activism direct by the individual it \u2019 s state to serve have be identify by individual from a wide range of specific experience  The motto of the Autistic Self Advocacy network be \u201c nothing about u  without u \u201d  Girls Educational  Mentoring Services  an organization create to serve trafficked woman and girl  be found by a woman traffic in childhood and state a part of their philosophy that \u201c the voice and experience of youth survivor be integral to the development and implementation of all GEMS \u2019 programming \u201d It isn \u2019 t a new idea that people face specific challenge know a thing or two about those challenge  and that those observe from the outside often approach their issue in counterproductive way  Many woman  I don \u2019 t attempt to build community with male  who have never transition consistently fail to approach the issue with genuine empathy  Some of them appear to believe that  before a woman with a history of transition can be welcome back into the fold  proper penance must be demonstrate  We be apparently obligate to apologize personally for every antifeminist action ever perform by anyone FTM  \u201c Abandoning womanhood \u201d be see a deeply selfish  Nobody can truly abandon their trauma  no matter how hard they might try  and there be nothing anyone female can do to void her right to name herself a a woman if she so choose  Asking u to carry the real or perceived sin of everyone else on the same path we take be not fair  and expect u to talk shit with you about those who don \u2019 t stop transition be fuck up  We be not \u201c special snowflake \u201d for recognize the area in which our experience be distinct and have the selfempathy to recognize when we \u2019 re be treat poorly  Transition may not be a feminist act  but we be not bad feminist for try our best to survive  Is transition a selfish act  Insofar a any act intend to be selfpreserving over all else be  yeah  It \u2019 s worth note here that the perception of attempted selfpreservation a immorally selfish be apply very sparingly to the action of white  straight men  but broadly apply to anyone female  especially woman dehumanize in additional way   even by other woman within feminist community  Are we entitle to protect our own life to the best of our ability  or aren \u2019 t we  Under patriarchy  woman be frequently present with situation in which it be not in their own immediate best interest to act out feminist principle  Shitting on FTMs be not any more politically justifiable than mock a woman for wear makeup to work or get \u201c feminize \u201d cosmetic surgery  I absolutely do not believe that transition be more selfish than expect other woman to selfflagellate for have transition  Condemning someone for choose  under duress   an option that keep her alive but do not uplift other woman be not compatible with a realistic assessment of the threat woman live under  Referring to transition a an act of selfpreservation might seem confuse  since I \u2019 ve discuss in the past how I experience it a selfharm  In reconcile the knowledge that many woman ultimately felt their transition be an act of selfharm with the way many currently transition describe the process a lifesaving  the concept of selfharm a selfpreservation be essential  From SANE  a organization establish in the UK to improve quality of life for those affect by mental illness  Paradoxically  selfharm be mainly an act of selfpreservation  Participants find it helpful in control emotion and behaviour  There be a sense of a struggle against behavioural impulse that do not match long term goal and people \u2019 understanding of who they be  Most commonly  suicidal behaviour need curbing\u2013 over 100 participant say selfharming have prevent them from kill themselves  Instances of selfharm  particularly wristcutting and overdose  have be mistake for suicide attempt  It be clear  though  from our research  there be rarely a wish to die  Rather  participant often harm to end period of intense suicidal thought and feeling  try to save  not eliminate themselves  Many believe that harm prevent them from act of violence and generally make them able to behave in a more acceptable way  Often this entailed limiting expression of emotion  hide how one truly think and feel  \u201c It keep me happy in front of others  It have stop my depression spill out \u201d Selfharm appear to be associate with a felt need to keep inner life hide from others  even family and friend  For woman live under patriarchy  selfpreservation frequently appear to require selfharm  Once in a while  maybe there really isn \u2019 t any way to survive without selfharm  Often  there be  but to the victim of direct abuse or societal violence  an open door doesn \u2019 t always look like an open door  We do our best  Selfharm be an expression of distress  Realistic discussion of the potential cost of a give strategy be important we all deserve accurate information about our choices but condemnation be not  Just stop the behavior itself win \u2019 t eliminate the distress that make it feel necessary in the first place  From SANE again  Six participant write that it be pivotal to the success of their attempt to discontinue harm to keep choice to harm a a possibility  This may be for fear of lose a coping mechanism  it may also be that accept the possibility of future selfharm may validate past decision to harm  remove associate guilt and shame  \u201c After I \u2019 d be in hospital  I go to the college nurse and tell her I have be selfharming  She tell me that there be nothing wrong with do it and that I should continue if I want to  and book me into see a counsellor  By tell me that I could do it  it take the guilt out of the cycle and I slowly begin to stop  I finally realise that what I be do wasn \u2019 t \u2018 bad \u2019 or \u2018 wrong \u2019  it be just my way of coping \u201d Taking the guilt out of the cycle may be an important element in successful treatment  follow the usual feeling of reliefrelease andor calm  a quarter of participant felt guiltshameembarrassment and one in nine experienced selfloathing after an episode of selfharm  Given that these emotion be also precipitant of selfharm it be easy to see how such behaviour can fee itself in a vicious circular dynamic\u2013 but only insofar a it be interpret a wrong or loathsome rather than a simple fact  It be not helpful to shame  mock  or express disgust with the strategy a woman have employ in an attempt to survive the circumstance of her life  and sabotage another woman \u2019 s heal from patriarchal trauma be an antifeminist act  If you need to vent about your own complicated feeling concern a certain survival strategy  find an appropriate place to communicate about that  Feel what you feel  But have some respect for your sister when you do it  Don \u2019 t act like \u201c transmen betray woman \u201d or \u201c FTM body be disgust \u201d be a sound feminist critique  It \u2019 s not  While we \u2019 re on the subject  voyeuristic consumption of uncredited postop image of someone \u2019 s shirtless or naked body take without permission and use for basically the polar opposite of the OP \u2019 s intention be not chill  whatever judgement you hold about those intention  Asking for a little bit of sensitivity around an issue that have shape so many woman \u2019 s body and life in way that will never leave u isn \u2019 t the same a say that transition should never be criticize  and expect somebody you just meet with a history of transition to grovel for your forgiveness because you \u2019 re carry a lot of intense emotion about the type of trauma she have live with be wildly inappropriate  On top of be morally wrong  treat other woman like stupid  selfish traitor be a shit political strategy  By refuse to regard anyone with a history of transition a your sister unless she demonstrate sufficient submissiveness and willingness to disavow others who make the same choice she do  you \u2019 re screen out everyone in that group who have fight to reclaim some amount of selfworth  The handful who may continue to engage with you despite your mistreatment of them be not go to be able to feel or perform their best in a mess up emotional climate like that  For those observe from outside and still buy into trans ideology  these display of callousness  and the presence of obviously selfhating detransitioned woman be expect to atone  validate the idea that \u201c TERFs \u201d be heartless bogeywomyn  Expressing empathy for those who transition  on the other hand  pave the way for anyone with these experience look for a way back home by facilitate sincere connection and understanding  Many of u felt there be no way we could conceive of ourselves a female anymore  that we didn \u2019 t deserve to  and that weren \u2019 t want anywhere  This belief can trap somebody for year live a life they no longer want  Living stealth a a man be the lonely I \u2019 ve ever felt  It be absolutely fuck miserable  It \u2019 s so not okay to undermine opportunity for someone of that experience to connect with other woman  provide she \u2019 s ready to engage in good faith  That \u2019 s another thing loving boundary create to protect the intention of female space be not incompatible with make room for those of u with a history of transition  If a currently transidentified female be still try to talk others into transition  or isn \u2019 t okay with be acknowledge a a woman within woman \u2019 s community  she \u2019 s probably not ready to participate there  That doesn \u2019 t mean she \u2019 s an evil traitor to femaleness  though  It doesn \u2019 t mean she \u2019 s \u201c like a man \u201d  It just mean she may not be a good fit for that group right then  because she \u2019 s carry some complicate baggage that could hurt others  This isn \u2019 t about make sure we have pronoun circle at our bonfire or erode the definition of female  It \u2019 s about listen to each other  It \u2019 s about welcome woman who recognize a need to find community a woman  but aren \u2019 t sure they have a place anywhere anymore  We all need each other  We all need to be see  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 BORN WRONG"}
