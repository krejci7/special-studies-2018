comment box doesn \u2019 t allow line break  so this way I can post a link to it for anyone else who absolutely can not read that many word with no line in between   \u201c Where be the people who switch pronoun at 10  switch pronouns again at 25  and find the experience traumatizing  Where be the people who receive unneeded medical intervention and be permanently  or temporarily  harm  \u201d I transition FTM at 16  be on testosterone and have a double mastectomy by 17  I \u2019 m 20 now and back to understand myself a a lesbian  like I be before I find out about transition and latch onto it a a way to \u201c fix \u201d body issue create by the challenge of grow up in a deeply misogynistic and lesbianhating world  I don \u2019 t know if he \u2019 s ever plan on use the interview directly but I \u2019 ve speak to Singal at length about what happen to me and I know at least one other woman who transition underage and talk to him  too  so he know woman who go through this be out there  He be not speak in the hypothetical  I absolutely be traumatize by what happen to me  and I \u2019 m not the only one  I \u2019 m a part of support network for woman who stop transition that have over 100 member  and that \u2019 s just the individual who have go look for others with this experience and find u  I \u2019 ve meet more than a dozen of these lady in person at different times\u2026 we \u2019 re definitely real  If you \u2019 re interested in learn more about this experience  here \u2019 s a publication by some of these woman  not focus specifically on pediatric transition although I believe at least one contributor do transition underage   http  wwwgreenwomanstorecombloodandvisionshtml Plenty of others who transition  whether they continue or not  live with complicated feeling about what happen  Not all of u name those experience the same way  search for community to process that pain  or ever \u201c go public \u201d to any degree  This be trauma  Hormone therapy really wasn \u2019 t that safe  in my experience  I remember be 17 and watch my pediatric endocrinologist literally Google dose information right in front of me  Didn \u2019 t inspire confidence  The doctor control my HRT have no idea what they be do  at least with patient like me  They be all just a confuse about how to treat me medically a they be about how to interact with me a a human be  When I be on testosterone and take Adderal for ADD  I get heart palpitation  chest pain  and shortness of breath  I didn \u2019 t tell anyone because I didn \u2019 t want to have to choose between a psych med that be make a huge difference in my ability to function in the workplace and hormone therapy  and I didn \u2019 t want to acknowledge that what I be do be dangerous  Early in my transition  I go through menopause  This cause vaginal atrophy and drip incontinence that have persist for year  I piss myself slowly all day now  it \u2019 s really not cute or fun  I refuse to acknowledge it be connect to the HRTcaused vaginal atrophy that immediately precede it onset until month after go off testosterone  Yeah  I sign a paper say I know that could happen  I also think this treatment be my only hope for cop with the intense feeling of alienationdisgust with my femaleness  I be wrong  Transition didn \u2019 t help  It do harm  harm that I now have to learn how to live with on top of all the shit I think transition would fix  I know plenty of others who have a wide range of even more concerning side effect on testosterone  and many of u didn \u2019 t ever say a word about these health problem until we be \u201c desist \u201d  Nobody want to be tell they need to go off it  many of u be willing to lie or risk our health in order to stay on testosterone  My double mastectomy be severely traumatize  I pay a guy  a guy who do this every day for cash  to drug me to sleep and cut away healthy tissue  I do this because I believe it would heal all of the emotional issue I be blame on my female body  It didn \u2019 t work  Now I \u2019 m still all fuck up and I \u2019 m miss body part  too  There be no surgery that will undo what \u2019 s be done\u2026 add synthetic material to resemble the tissue of mine that be incinerate year ago would not help me  It take 3 year of stuff down every negative feeling about my mastectomy before I be ready to face that what happen do harm to me  I be off hormone for month before I admit to myself that I deeply  deeply regret this surgery  The best way I can think of describe the loss be like  kill a family member who I blame for be a burden on me  and then realize year later that the blame I put on them be extremely and tragically misplace  It be not their fault  but they \u2019 re go now anyway  because I want them go  I have lose my breast and I have lose the chance to reconcile with my breast  It wouldn \u2019 t be easy  but it would be work worth do  Now the work before me instead be reconcile with what I \u2019 ve do and with the chest I have now flat  scar  assymmetrical  and nervedamaged  \u201c The social pressure on ci people to become trans  on the other hand  do not exist  Singal say his goal be to help child  But who be help by gin up fear of amorphous harm do to vaguely define victim  \u201d I think the victim be define pretty clearly  those who ultimately end up feel that transition do them harm  It would have help me to have not be subject to this shit  so yeah  I appreciate write that acknowledge woman like me exist  The framework of ci v trans be extremely limited which do you think I be  Am I cis  because I be bear female and describe myself a a woman  Funny  because my driver \u2019 s license still say Maxwell  and it still say male  My chest be flat  I grow a beard that I don \u2019 t usually shave  So do that make me trans  This dichotomy leave no room for woman who experience severe alienation from their femaleness but still choose to claim it  and it leave no room for woman who claim their femaleness after transition have transform their material circumstance  Please don \u2019 t give me the \u201c you \u2019 re nonbinary \u201d gotcha  either\u2026 I \u2019 m not  I \u2019 m a woman  This happen to woman  I know it would be a lot easy for a lot of people if I would just lie about what I be  but I \u2019 m do convince myself to believe convenient lie about me that deep down  I recognize a false  I invest so much in this idea that  by make myself superficially distinct from other woman  I could erase the harm do to me because of my femaleness  That lie give me hope  but it \u2019 s just not true  I have an awful lot more in common with butch lesbian who never transition than with anyone bear male  \u201c Singal \u2019 s article be less a call to help child  and more a confused reaffirmation of stereotype about queer people seductively convert straights \u201d Really  Is it  I go from be a lesbian who be see a a lesbian to be a lesbian who be see a a man  after a string of heterosexual doctor do a bunch of shit to my body  Who \u2019 s try to convert who  I start date my girlfriend when I be already live stealth at school and in public  We be never see a a lesbian couple until this year  and even now  I \u2019 m not usually recognize a female  Yes  I ask for the treatment I get  I push for them hard  I do that because I genuinely have no idea that a woman could feel the way I felt  I didn \u2019 t know a woman could hate her breast  could hate the way she be treat  could hate her own femaleness  I didn \u2019 t have enough empathy for woman under patriarchy  include myself  to realize that these feeling be an entirely reasonable response to all of the horrible shit that have already happen to me by the time I be 16 and beg to be put on hormone  Pediatric medical transition be a relatively new phenomenon  and it take a while to get to a place with your trauma where you \u2019 re comfortable go public  Give it a few year and there will be an awful lot more of u  I wish this wasn \u2019 t the case  I wish you be right  that this treatment wasn \u2019 t do harm  that all of these child be go to grow up and be just fine  I wish that I be just fine  I \u2019 m not  this destroy me in a lot of way  I will never be the same  Transitioning do require courage  but so do recognize that transition have do you far more harm than good  Disagree all you want but try to remember that you \u2019 re talk about my trauma and the trauma of others like me  the least you can do be acknowledge that we exist  This be not Triton  What happen to u be not painless  It make sense that I \u2019 m concern about these treatment that do me so much harm a a teenager become increasingly available to child  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 BORN WRONG"}
