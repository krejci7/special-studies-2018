"tags": ["Uncategorized"], "text": "This isn \u2019 t my surgeon I \u2019 m talk about here  just to be clear  I go to Dr Curtis Crane in San Francisco  I \u2019 m talk about another \u201c big name \u201d in transitional surgery  Dr Garramone  I go to go doublecheck the spelling of his name yesterday  I always think it \u2019 s Garramond for some reason  and get a look at his website  Which\u2026 like  damn  From his website  ManSculpture\u00ae Body Masculinization  Transgender Surgery ManSculpture\u00ae Body Masculinization be commonly perform at the same time a the FTM Top Surgery\u00ae Procedure  This consist of shape the body to a more \u201c masculine \u201d form with the use of Power Assisted Liposuction technique  By lipocontouring the abdomen  stomach   love handle  flank   and the \u201c saddle bag \u201d area of the outside hip or thigh with ManSculpting  Dr Garramone can give your body a more streamlined and masculine appearance  This be an attempt to upsell\u2026 Garramone \u2019 s special trademark manly lipo  you \u2019 ve get to specify it \u2019 s masculine  because get fat remove from your body be culturally cod a feminine  cost  2500 to  6000 extra  With the use of the derisive term \u201c love handle \u201d and \u201c saddle bag \u201d  he \u2019 s use the \u201c problemagitatesolve \u201d advertising strategy  This be use most transparently in infomercial for quick fix product  Here \u2019 s a rundown of the structure from a marketing blog  Problem  Identify your reader \u2019 s pain point  Agitate  Stir it up so it hurt to the point of discomfort  Solve  Deliver a solution  The problem reader be have be profound  lifealtering level of disconnect andor distress with their body  The language here be intend to agitate these feeling by use word that connote disgust for body fat  particularly disgust for typically female pattern of body fat distribution  The solution be liposuction  Deliberately play on the emotional problem of those who seek transition in order to \u201c move product \u201d should not be consider acceptable conduct from someone provide a surgery that \u2019 s think to be the only way to avoid death by suicide  If you think transition be essential to survive the desire to transition  you should be horrify to see this shit  Somebody offering you a lifeboat shouldn \u2019 t be say \u201c hey  for  2500 to  6000 more  I \u2019 ll throw in some water bottle  and by the way  you look fat from up here \u201d That be not the kind of help anyone should be grateful for  The fact that this guy be still get pay a shit ton of money to remove healthy tissue  despite a clear lack of empathy for his patient  speaks to the chronic low selfworth and desperation that tend to drive business for any cosmetic surgeon  It \u2019 s worth note here that an awful lot of people who be seek transitional surgery  myself include  spend month obsess over their prospective surgeon  reading and reread every relevant page of their website  For me  this be true from the very early phase  when I be really just fantasizing  all the way up to right before my operation  My impression from the time I \u2019 ve spent in both transition and detransition community online have lead me to believe I be very typical in this respect  Garramone almost certainly have a huge amount of repeat traffic from the same viewer  which have to heighten the emotion impact of the strategically misogynistic language choose  The phrase \u201c love handle \u201d and \u201c saddle bag \u201d aren \u2019 t just agitate to FTMs  They \u2019 re a part of the language of selfdisgust that all woman be taught  One of the patriarchallyapproved technique we be give to soothe ourselves be externalize this shame  so it \u2019 s also how many woman talk about body fat in general  I google \u201c love handle liposuction \u201d for a minute and that \u2019 s apparently how an awful lot of plastic surgeon refer to the flank  Really  It \u2019 s coercive to deliberately activate shame in order to convince people make vulnerable by an incredibly toxic society that remove healthy tissue will solve their emotional problem  Cosmetic surgeon  include those offer transitional surgery  be try to move product  Like most people in sale  they prey on emotional vulnerability  When I go to Curtis Crane \u2019 s office for my double mastectomy consult  I couldn \u2019 t believe how nice the staff treat me  As a teenage butch lesbian with learn disability who be unable to perform maledefined femininity \u201c correctly \u201d and pretty much always perceive a \u201c weird \u201d or outright peg a a dyke  I be not use to stranger be that kind to me  I haven \u2019 t have stranger treat me with that kind of impersonal sweetness anywhere else except church  The last time it happen at church be while I be work a couple week ago and take a man to a sign language service at the Kingdom Hall  I get offer two different job  they make sure I get second  my foodbody issue have improve in a lot of way but I still have a real weakness for anyone who indicate they don \u2019 t want me to starve until I look \u201c well \u201d   A part of me want to go back follow their dress code  the first time I have even think of go out in public wearing clothes I hat in year  That \u2019 s how lovebombing make you feel it make you want to do whatever \u2019 s necessary to keep that attention come  Another experience that remind me of Crane be go to the dermatologist who prescribe me Accutane when I be 14  a woman who have visibly have a decent amount of elective procedure on her face  She look at my  moderate and typical for my age group  acne with such pity and she promise she be go to help me be the beautiful young woman I be mean to be  The concept of a lifechanging makeover be not a new one to any woman  As someone who have a trauma response to dress \u201c like a girl \u201d  the pressure to be beautiful  accord to male standard  have be painful in a specific way  Lots of woman have try to help me look more like them all my life  My degree of compliance vary by situation  but I consistently experience these effort a a rejection of me a I already be  whether or not I let on about it  How do I convince myself that try to transform myself into a man be go to feel any good than try to transform myself into a type of woman I never have any interest in be  Sometimes I can follow my old logic  sometimes I can \u2019 t  Neither make sense without the basic assumption that I need fix  Neither make sense without a fundamental lack of faith in the ability of butch lesbian to live meaningful life  I don \u2019 t know  Fuck Garramone  and fuck Crane  ", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 BORN WRONG"}
