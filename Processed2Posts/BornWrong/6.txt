["Uncategorized"], "text": "I \u2019 m posting here the statement I make on behalf of ReSisters that \u2019 s be read on Women \u2019 s Liberation Radio News  Here be the episode where it be include  My name be Max Robinson and I \u2019 m a member of ReSisters  an organization for detransitioned and reidentified womyn  as well a femaleborn trans people  ReSisters form to build solidarity between these population and to fight for female liberation  particularly when the battle at hand will be well fight when arm with our perspective  I \u2019 ve do a lot of speaking and write about be a woman who stop my ftm transition and reclaimed myself a a lesbian  Rightwing Christians have often move to coopt my experience  and those of many other woman like me  try to utilize u against our own interest and the interest of female a a class  Having my word take out of context and use by the right lead me to understand a lot about the dynamic at play when fundamentalist decide to \u201c include \u201d radical feminist in their platform  They wouldn \u2019 t do that unless they know that ultimately  the suppose \u201c alliance \u201d would serve their patriarchal order  I could list many example of hardrightwingers utilize the word of detransitioned women\u2014for one  Michelle Cretella  formerly a Board member of NARTH  the foremost antigay \u201c conversion therapy \u201d organization in the US  and current president of the American College of Pediatricians  an activist group of conservative physician against gay and lesbian parenting  Cretella recently write a glowing endorsement of feminist anthology \u201c Female Erasure  \u201d specifically mention all the detransitioned woman \u2019 s narrative  Was this a heartwarming moment of female solidarity across political line  No  Cretella blatantly lie about our essay  utilize the idea of u for her own agenda  Conversion therapy advocate believe that be gay or lesbian be link to childhood gender role confusion  They believe a wholesome Christian family\u2014a Gender Correct Father and a Gender Correct Mother\u2014prevents child from be gay or lesbian  Their issue with pediatric transition be that they believe it \u2019 s against God \u2019 s plan\u2014that it make permanent the \u201c role confusion \u201d of homosexuality  which should instead be \u201c straighten out \u201d They think woman like u be potentially useful a pitiable rhetorical object  Or that we can be \u201c perfected \u201d into stereotypeconforming heterosexual woman  Most woman who stop ftm transition be lesbian  many of u have no intention of lead stereotypedriven life  many of u will continue to live socially pass a men whether we want to or not  and all of u want the best possible life for our friend and love one who still live a transmen  Nothing that hurt gay  lesbian  and transmen be go to be acceptable to u  We don \u2019 t welcome someone like Cretella to use our word against u  But this be one example in a large trend  The Federalist put a reporter  Stella Morabito  on the \u201c gender identity \u201d beat  The Alliance Defending Freedom start fund a group call itself Women \u2019 s Liberation Front  The Heritage Foundation host a panel discussion title \u201c Biology Isn \u2019 t Bigotry  Why Sex Matters in the Age of Gender Identity \u201d The power difference between these \u201c ally \u201d ought to tell u a lot  Why be the powerhouse think tank that help elect Trump host radical feminist on a panel  Who host the event  Who publish the article  or air the news segment  Who \u2019 s get the money in their hand  Usually  it \u2019 s not radical feminist  Conservatives have demonstrate time and again that they be capable of extremely effective strategizing  Their current strategy relies on exploit the inherent weakness in LGBT \u201c inclusion \u201d practice which fail to differentiate between the need of lesbian  gay men  transmen  transwomen  and other queeridentified people  By fight against what they call \u201c SOGI  sexual orientation and gender identity  law \u201d \u2014which be any legislation impact any member of these obviously distinct and internally diverse group  the right utilizes legitimate feminist resistance against the excess of \u201c gender identity \u201d against the entire range of lesbian  gay  and trans people  as well a woman overall  A feminist response would need to hold some nuance\u2014defending lesbian  gay  and transgender housing and employment right against the like of the Heritage Foundation  for example  while also resist law which would render sex a meaningless category  A feminist response must be a real alternative  rather than throw weight behind either \u201c side \u201d when neither side represent the interest of female a a class\u2014that be  all female  whether lesbian  straight  transgenderidentifying  or other  There be a difference between law that allow gendernonconforming people\u2014transidentified or not\u2014to participate fully in society  versus law that entitle someone with a penis to housing in a woman \u2019 s shelter base on a state \u201c identity \u201d A feminist response need to account for this discrepancy  There \u2019 s nothing feminist about ally with those who want to make discrimination against transgender  lesbian  and gay people as legal a possible  When woman be use to promote conservative value against our will  we have even less control over how they choose to represent our belief and experience  Cooptation  whether consensual or not  undermine the goal of female liberation  Under the cut I \u2019 m go to longer  unedited version  My name be Max Robinson and I write this statement address collaboration with conservative on behalf of ReSisters  an organization for detransitioned and reidentified womyn  as well a female born trans people  form to protect the interest of this population  Inclusion of radical feminist on conservative platform would not happen unless the belief they be be allow to espouse by explicitly heterosexual authority be not any kind of threat to the conservative church or patriarchal family unit  Who host the event  Who publish the article  or air the news segment  Who \u2019 s get the money in their hand  Usually  it \u2019 s not radical feminist  I \u2019 m go to address several contemporary instance of conservative utilize radical feminist to promote their own position  Conservatives have demonstrate time and time again that they be capable of extremely effective strategizing  The Heritage Foundation be a conservative think tank that help to get Trump elect and have support him in many way since he take office  This same organization also invite the wellrespected lesbian activist Miriam BenShalom  among others  to a panel discussion title \u201c Biology Isn \u2019 t Bigotry  Why Sex Matters in the Age of Gender Identity \u201d  The moderator of this panel  Ryan T Anderson  have numerous piece publish on the Heritage Foundation website oppose samesex marriage  samesex adoption  and antidiscrimination law protect all type of LGBT individual  In these article  Ryan often make no distinction between gay men  lesbian woman  and transgender people  use the term \u201c SOGI law \u201d  sexual orientation and gender identity  to describe any legislation impact any member of these obviously distinct and internally diverse group  In the same article  Ryan consistently fail to differentiate between law that protect transgender  and gay or lesbian  people \u2019 s right to housing  employment  or the ability to charge biasmotivated assault or murder a hate crime  at no cost to the right of woman in general  versus those that entitle someone with a penis to access space like a femaleexclusive spa on the basis of verbally state identity  By participate in alliance like this  radical feminist be lend their support to a movement with the goal of keep actual discrimination  include biasmotivated assault or murder   against transgender  lesbian  and gay people as legal a possible  Who be serve by this coalition  and who be use  This be not sit next to the missionary \u2019 s son in the lunchroom  or bring muffin to your Republican neighbor when her husband be sick  Personal relationship be distinct from political alliance  Ryan might be an awesome guy to talk to in the grocery store line  but he be pay to produce material undermine the right of LGBT people to have family and access housing and employment without fear of mistreatment base exclusively on their orientation or history of transition  Beyond simply be antilesbian  the belief that the \u201c natural family \u201d consist of one man  one woman  and their offspring be directly in opposition to the foundational belief hold by radical feminist  An example even more pertinent to the member of ReSisters be the inclusion of Dr Michella Cretella in the feminist anthology Female Erasure  Here  a feminist do create and control the platform  but choose to include a conservative woman  Dr Cretella be the current president of the American College of Pediatricians  an activist group of conservative physician found in opposition to the American Academy of Pediatrics \u2019 support for samesex adoption  She serve for year on the board of director for NARTH  National Association for Research  Therapy of Homosexuality   now rebranded a the Alliance for Therapeutic Choice  The sole purpose of this organization be to justify and promote reparative therapy  an abusively antigay practice  Three member of ReSisters  Crash  Devorah  and Max  be also include in this anthology  We be not aware of Dr Cretella \u2019 s involvement until after publication  Cretella \u2019 s endorsement of Female Erasure include specific reference to the work of the ReSister member who contribute  \u201c detransitioned woman view their transgender experience a have be pressure into chemically and surgically impersonate a man in order to role play a heterosexual relationship with another biological woman \u201d Not only do none of u ever experience our transition in the way she describe  none of u indicate this in our contribution to Female Erasure  either  This blatant lie about our life and work serve the agenda of both the American College of Pediatricians and the Alliance for Therapeutic Choice much more effectively than the nuance express in our actual contribution  however  Antigay religious group frequently describe homosexuality a stem from \u201c gender role confusion \u201d  a formulation which imply that our deviant behavior can be correct through reparative therapy  Flattening our unique experience with transition in this way promote her consistently express belief that homosexuality can and should be fix whenever possible  She later describe a \u201c transgender tsunami \u201d and \u201c transgender tyranny \u201d  but never differentiate between transgender men and woman  or identifies men a the benefactor of misogyny  This do not serve woman  and it certainly do not serve lesbian woman  andor woman with a history of transition  Casting transgender people a a homogeneous pack of enemy be a conservative invention that lend itself readily to the misogynistic and homophobic basis of the conservative gripe with transition  Another quote from Cretella \u2019 s endorsement  \u201c However  the great gift I receive from Ruth \u2019 s invitation to be a part of Female Erasure be the opportunity to have civil and heartfelt conversation with fellow woman regard topic over which we sharply disagree  abortion  homosexuality in child  and samesex marriage and parenting  Together we discover that while we may never fully agree on these topic  we be more alike than we be different \u201d Yes  we may all bleed red  but uphold the fathercontrolled family unit at the cost of strip right from anyone who fail to perfectly recreate patriarchal structure in their home be in direct opposition to radical feminist value  Cretella minimize the importance of female reproductive autonomy  gay and lesbian child \u2019 s right to grow up in peace  marriage equality  and parental right for lesbian and gay people with child  By choose to work with woman like Cretella  radical feminist support the conservative devaluation of female life  Further evidence of right wing eagerness to coopt the narrative of detransitioned woman in particular be see in this article publish on the Illinois Family Institute \u2019 s website  whose \u201c statement on the family \u201d read \u201c We deny that \u201c family \u201d include two or more person of the same or opposite sex who live together outside the institution of marriage whether for convenience or homosexuality or romance or experimentation or otherwise \u201d Three member of ReSisters be quote in IFI \u2019 s article  Cari  Carey  and Crash   None be ask for permission  and none would have give their permission if ask  The single woman IFI choose to include  beforeafter  photo of  however  be the only one of the three who be heterosexual and relatively genderconforming in appearance  Although Cari and Crash be lesbian and all three of these woman acknowledge that many detransitioned woman be lesbian  there be no mention of lesbianism in the IFI article  Their experience and viewpoint be sanitize in order to oppose what IFI term \u201c sciencedenying sexuality dogma \u201d  a phrase which conflate homophobia with the critical thought these woman apply regard the role transition play in their own life  Collaboration with conservative regard issue of gender identity be intrinsically incompatible with radical feminist value  When it be willing  we be choose to water down our belief substantially in order to be tool of antiwoman  antigay organization  Making this choice demonstrate to other woman that access illusion of power through patriarchal authority be no less feminist than autonomous organization  When woman be use to promote conservative value against our will  we have even less control over how they choose to represent our belief and experience  Cooption  whether consensual or not  undermine the goal of the feminist movement  Thank you  Where you can find work of the woman mention
