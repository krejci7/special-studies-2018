Born wrong \u201d be a joke we \u2019 ve be make for year about our rescue St Bernard mix Kovu  a dog who be not breed with care  He \u2019 s get hip dysplasia  he shed more than any animal I \u2019 ve ever meet  he drool constantly  He have this habit of come over to u on the couch and bump into you with his head and snuffle you all over  which could be cute if he wasn \u2019 t always drool  Since he IS always drool  this wipe pretty impressive amount of drool all over your body  Drool isn \u2019 t just like a lot of spit  by the way  That \u2019 s what I think it be go to be when I get him  but it \u2019 s more like spit mixed with snot  It \u2019 s viscous and it doesn \u2019 t dry clear  The strand collect his own hair  dirt  and wet chunk of whatever horrible thing he \u2019 s gotten into that day  They swing off when he trot around  Sometimes one just hit you out of nowhere  He doesn \u2019 t listen  either  We \u2019 ve be try for year to get Kovu to sit down before he talk to u on the couch  instead of come over and wipe his slime mouth all over u and whatever notebooks  computer  sew project  etc we \u2019 re look at  Every single time he do it  we ask him to sit down  it get his head and drool away from u   He just look at you  When you \u2019 ve get food  he sit real quick  but good luck the rest of the time  You can look away and completely ignore him and he \u2019 s still gon na put his big wet head on you for like  1060 second before he finally sit down  if he ever even do  Sometimes he just slim you and then stomp off all bowlegged to go ruin some other corner of the house  He \u2019 s extremely naughty and I love him very much  When I be 18 and go to community college  which last like  6 month  I take this color theory class for fine art credit  It be after my mastectomy but before I \u2019 d be on hormone long enough to pass consistently  Most everyone in the color theory class think I be a woman  Same in cycling  I think  I only pass in biology  I can \u2019 t remember how I felt about that  So one of the big project in color theory be a monochromatic selfportrait  I suck at human face  could not stand to think about my appearance  and be tire of feel conspicuously bad than everybody else in the class  so I paint Kovu instead  My artist \u2019 s statement be about what him and me have in common  which I think pretty much boil down to \u201c we both do our best and we still mess everything up \u201d  I would have just be diagnose with ADD then  but I didn \u2019 t really know what it mean  For the first time  when I saw a psychiatrist with a flat chest and real straggly facial hair  the issue I \u2019 d have functioning at the same level a my peer in many area weren \u2019 t explain away by how sad I be  I stay on Wellbutrin  but he give me Adderal  too  That be the end of the conversation  It didn \u2019 t even occur to me for another 2 year to look up \u201c ADD adult woman \u201d  I be a man  and I be fine now  I take the pill and could not believe the difference it made I have one complete think about the actual environment in front of me at a time  New thought follow in a logical order and at a manageable speed  instead of a half dozen scatter race stream of anxious tangent overlap each other  I get my homework do  I didn \u2019 t wander off  It just felt like be normal  more normal than I \u2019 d ever be before  The constant screwups slow down  I didn \u2019 t microwave cup of noodle without water or lock myself out as often  Making few mistake make me feel like a more lovable person  I just want to stop be the problem  Part of why I love Kovu so much be that no matter how incredibly inconvenient he be to u  he never actually seem to think it \u2019 s his fault  He do the scold dog look and all that sometimes when you \u2019 re really put out with him  but even then  it \u2019 s so obvious that he have no idea why you don \u2019 t want to be buddy right then  It \u2019 s just never occur to him that screw everything up could be connect to people be annoy with you sometimes  Selfblame be entirely unthinkable to this dog  and I envy that more than I can even figure out how to express  I feel consume by shame constantly  all day  sometimes  Shame for thing I just do  shame for thing that I do last month  shame for thing I do in 6th grade  Feels like I \u2019 m a big old carcass get tear to shred by a billion different shame  a whole ecosystem of lively and diverse shame  An awful lot of the time  all I can feel for myself be complete disgust  This have be get well in the last year or so  but that \u2019 s really  really new for me  Something I would have learn  if I would have be see a a woman  if my doctor have know anything or actually give a shit  would have be that grow up female and attention deficit mean grow up believe that it \u2019 s your fault you aren \u2019 t the same a your peer  Reading Sari Solden \u2019 s book about this recently be absolutely crazy it never occur to me that I could exist without constant overwhelming shame over all the stuff I couldn \u2019 t always do right  Like  that be a new concept to me  I want that for myself  clearly\u2026 I want to be like Kovu  A lot of my tumblr friend during the year when I be transition be \u201c otherkin \u201d  people who identify with some nonhuman entity so strongly that they felt it be more accurate to say that they identify AS the entity  I find these group from others mock them but end up stick around  We be all very traumatized and this cop mechanism never strike a all that much bad than any of the other weird shit we do  I didn \u2019 t argue with anyone about it but never do understand the necessity of leap between \u201c identify with \u201d and \u201c identifying a \u201d  since they would all clarify when press that they know they weren \u2019 t literally what they describe themselves a  and be clear about it be a spiritual beliefcoping strategy  An awful lot of otherkin I know start out just do a lot of roleplay online  I didn \u2019 t consider myself \u201c kin \u201d in any sense  but in a way  I envy them  too  Obviously that \u2019 s not reasonable or fair\u2026 all of u have horrible life in a lot of way  But secretly  I still love the idea of actually convince myself I be a dog and have my friend all agree  What stop me from do what some of my friend be do wasn \u2019 t not wish I be a dog  What stop me be my fear of look stupid  Pretty much all of my otherkin friend also identify a trans  I saw them do the same kind of clueseeking look into their childhood that take place in my process of justify my transition to myself  Things like \u201c I always love playing in the dirt \u201d be use to support a current identity a a certain Digimon or whatever  I could see the flimsiness of this logic even then  These people talk a lot about how \u201c kin positivity \u201d  but consider themselves nonhuman didn \u2019 t appear to be enhance the quality of their life in any material sense  at least as far a I could discern  \u201c It \u2019 s a coping strategy for my traumamental illness and you don \u2019 t know my life \u201d be pretty much always the end of any conversation about whether or not this be help  Even so\u2026 few month before I finally start let myself question the efficacy of transition a a strategy in my life  I remember make this rambling post about how one of the reason I identify a male and like he pronouns be because it felt closer to be a dog than she pronouns or femaleness  That \u2019 s where my line of reason stop  at that point  The broad context of the circle I be in allow for me to say something like this without anyone ask any of the question that the statement pretty much begs  why do you want to be a dog  What be that dog and men have in common that you want badly enough to justify hormone  surgery  and everything else  It would have startle me to hear  but I think I could have answer it  even then  Here \u2019 s some of the reason I think I \u2019 d have give  People expect less of dog  People be nice to dog  When dog make a mistake  people don \u2019 t treat them bad for it  Dogs get to go outside a lot  Dogs don \u2019 t have to worry what anybody think of them  I \u2019 m just notice now be that all these thing assume the dog  or the man  isn \u2019 t abuse or neglect  \u201c Always greener on the other side \u201d thinking be a big part of transition for me  I be really into convince myself that the outcome I would get from these step would always be the \u201c best \u201d one possible  With my double mastectomy  I know that noticeable asymmetry  result very different from a male chest  nerve damage  and loss of nipple sensation be risk I be assume  and if you ask me  I would have say that all of those thing very carefully  I think I really do usually believe that  there be always crack in my selfdeception   but it be not true  I be way too dissociate to truly engage in earnest with the subject matter  my own body  In no sense do I actually try to imagine the reality of living with so many of the experience that I have no choice but to live with now  My priority be so different then  Having it \u201c look good \u201d and happen quickly be what I want most  The insurance I have would have cover an innetwork guy  but the only review I could find of his work be that they have end up go to Dr Crane for a revision anyway  I have be earn royalty since I be 16 design printtoorder gift and apparel with the intention of use it for surgery and for college  so with some help from my family  I could afford him  I know Garramone have more malelooking result with chest the size of mine  but I didn \u2019 t want to fly to Florida  Here \u2019 s an aside real quick\u2026 just google his name to check my spelling and the description for his site include a trademark register with a national trademark office  \u201c Top Surgery \u00ae Florida \u2013 Dr Garramone perform the best FTM Top Surgery \u00ae Procedure  Periareolar  Keyhole  Double Incision  and DI offer in Florida \u201d  I hadn \u2019 t be to his site in a long time  It \u2019 s a lot more transparent about market transitional surgery than I recall notice in 2012 or whatever  The way my chest actually look now be not a possibility I have actually seriously consider  as far a I can remember  even though I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s especially unusual as far a result go  I think anything would be good than have breast  but I refuse to investigate my feeling about the individual outcome contain within that \u201c anything \u201d  Not that I \u2019 d feel any good if my chest do look identical to a man \u2019 s  I don \u2019 t believe anymore that cosmetic surgery can \u201c go right \u201d  Wanting to look different so badly that you actually pay money to be drug to unconsciousness  cut apart  and wake up stick back together by doctor  who get pay to do this all the time  \u2026 how could that be anything but traumatic  I understand that many survivor of cosmetic surgery disagree with me on this  They \u2019 re fully entitle to believe what they will about their own experience  and about cosmetic surgery a a practice  But so be I  My big hope for conversation about these topic isn \u2019 t that whoever I \u2019 m talk to agree with everything I say  All I really want be to for u to be able to listen to each other  For most of my transition  I would have completely shut down if I try to read anything like the kind of stuff I write now  I remember try to write rebuttal to feminist write on transition that I find offensive but never be able to get more than a few word down  because the possibility that transition be not this save grace make me too distress to think straight  I be extremely dissociated and absolutely miserable in my body  I have do an awful lot of thing try to feel well  and nothing have work  I just want something to work  By the time it be become difficult to keep convince myself transition have resolve these issue that be clearly still present  I have already invest so much  I didn \u2019 t want to die  and this have seem like the only way to stay alive  It be really fuck hard to admit I be wrong  If I hadn \u2019 t be in a place with more stability and supportive woman in my life than I \u2019 ve ever have before  I think I would have back out  Actually face my reality have be much  much hard than transition  Lately I \u2019 ve be work on the way I tend to think or sometimes actually say \u201c I want to die \u201d whenever anything go wrong  which get a lot bad when I go off Cymbalta  Now  when it happen  I remind myself that I don \u2019 t really want that  I just be feel hopeless  I walk myself through name what \u2019 s bother me and make a plan to address it  That mean take step like consider a transfer at work  quit weed  try to find somebody to talk to about my feeling  or whatever  I \u2019 ve be notice that for me now  the way I feel when I say \u201c I want to die \u201d be pretty close to the way I remember feel when I be obsessively fixate on the whatever next step of my transition  It \u2019 s an attempt to find a shred of hope in hopelessness  to believe that something can relieve my pain  whether that \u2019 s suicide or facial hair  These thought be a feeble attempt to combat learn helplessness  They be a maladaptive expression of resilience in the face of a world that be build to destroy woman like me any way it can  \u201c If I \u2019 m the problem  I can fix it \u201d line of think justified my suicidal ideation as well a transition  My overwhelming selfblame seem like an attempt to claim control where I feel I have none  Do I really have none  though  Not quite  I \u2019 m realize that now  a an adult woman  I have a lot more control than I ever realize  I don \u2019 t have as much control a I want  and I don \u2019 t have as much control a I feel woman deserve  Still  an awful lot of what have keep me still in fear be not material barrier  It \u2019 s the fear I have be teach since girlhood  Why bother lock woman in if we \u2019 re all too scar to go outside anyway  Patriarchy have grow complacent in the totality of it reign over woman  The more time I spend actively train myself out of learned helplessness  the easy it \u2019 s become to strategize around the obstacle that be not just in my head  I don \u2019 t know  I mean to tie this all together more coherently but I \u2019 m kind of lose interest  The main thing be  I don \u2019 t think anybody be actually bear wrong anymore  but that kind of thinking be a major part of why I transition  Now  I believe everyone deserve the quality of support and accommodation necessary for her to live a she be  I do not believe that the male medical industrial complex be a great place to find genuine heal from issue of profound and lifealtering bodily dissociationdistress
