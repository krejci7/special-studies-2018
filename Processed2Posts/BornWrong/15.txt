"text": "Discussion of the rise in transition rate be potentially cause by social contagion  usually discuss a spread through social medium  often neglect to address what have render so many young people vulnerable to it  When transition possibly cause by social contagion be bring up without explicitly acknowledge that only certain individual be likely to be susceptible to seek transition after online exposure to trans community  I feel like the uninitiated be likely to assume this be some kind of fad  like when everybody in 6th grade make a Club Penguin account  It \u2019 s not  Yeah  I read a lot of fuckyeahftmstumblrcom before I come out  and I \u2019 m not go to say that kind of thing have no impact on me  Still  I really doubt I would have give much of a shit  or spend so much time on those site  if it weren \u2019 t for the people on that blog look more like me than anyone at my school  if it weren \u2019 t for them describe their dysphoria in language that very much resonate with me  if I hadn \u2019 t be look for some kind of \u201c out \u201d all my life  etc etc  We all have different story about how we get here  but none of them  that I \u2019 ve heard  at least  be actually as simple a \u201c I saw it on the internet \u201d  even if immerse ourselves in internet subculture that glorify transition be one factor  This implication be alienate as hell to people who never have their emotional problem validate until they describe them use the language of transition  From the Wikipedia article on behavioral contagion  Behavioral contagion be a result of the reduction of fear or restraint \u2013 aspect of a group or situation which prevent certain behavior from be perform   2  Restraints be typically groupderived  mean that the \u201c observer \u201d  the individual wishing to perform a certain behavior  be constrain by the fear of rejection by the group  who would view this behavior a a \u201c lack of impulse control \u201d   2  An individual  the \u201c observer \u201d  want to perform some behavior  but that behavior would violate the unspoken and accept rule of the group or situation they be in  these rule be the restraint prevent the observer from perform that action  Once the restraint be break or reduce the observer be then \u201c free \u201d to perform the behavior his or herself  this be achieve by the \u201c intervention \u201d of the model  The model be another individual  in the same group or situation a the observer  who perform the behavior which the observer wish to perform   2  Stephenson and Fielding  1971  describe this effect a \u201c  Once  one member of a gathering have perform a commonly desire action  the payoff for similar action or nonaction be materially alter  \u2026  The  initiator  by his action  establish an inequitable advantage over the other member of the gathering which they may proceed to nullify by follow his example  \u201d  1  This ring true for me  When I first learn transition exist  when I be around 13  I be really intrigue  but never consider it a a possibility for myself the cost be too high  These be people I only saw on daytime talk show when I stay home sick  get call really horrible name and treat a spectacle  Over the next few year  a I gradually learn more about transition and get to know more individual who be transition online  I felt less and less like transition would make me a freak or totally alone  By the time I be around 16  the costbenefit equation have shift considerably in my eye  enough for me to start pursue transition  In a way  it \u2019 s a good thing that I didn \u2019 t judge myself a harshly for have a drive to transition  I don \u2019 t think people who want to transition  or who do transition  should feel like they \u2019 re disgusting freak for it  the way I use to  And of course  not transition alone wouldn \u2019 t have resolve any of the trauma or pervasive lifelong gendered rejection that make me want to escape femaleness  It \u2019 s not like I would be totally fine if I have just manage to avoid one maladaptive cop mechanism  Given that no healthier option be make accessible to me  I be go to keep try selfpreservation strategy with high cost  transition or no transition  I might have have more serious alcohol issue  throw myself into casual sex  whatever  Something be gon na have to give  So\u2026 social contagion  a it \u2019 s generally understood  to my knowledge  I \u2019 m no expert  doesn \u2019 t create new aspiration out of thin air  It reduce inhibition that prevent someone from do something they kinda want to do in the first place  or would once somebody else tell them about it  If your kid ask for hormone after spend 3 day straight on FTM Youtube  bad news blame the internet be an overly simplistic explanation that erase the complexity of their inner life  Succeeding in block them from transition alone will not resolve any of the underlying feeling that motivate them to seek it  The way this model of social contagion can apply to maladaptive cop mechanism be really striking  At my middle school  a ton of the girl  me include  start cut one after another  Were we cut to be cool  Was it the same a the way those fuck save the booby bracelet spread  No  All of u be still humiliate if anyone saw our cut  even other girl who be cut  It felt like shit  It definitely do not help u when people talk about how all the girl be cut lately a if it be like any other trend  We all have our own reason for do it  When I go to my little sister \u2019 s graduation from a fancy charter school this year  I be really surprised that so many of her classmate be trans  I be the only person who transition at my high school several year ago  and I go on independent study to do it  Almost nobody even know why I wasn \u2019 t in class anymore  So why be there so many trans teenager at this school  Are my sister \u2019 s classmate \u201c fake it \u201d  I doubt it  The most likely explanation to me seem like  since the social cost be low  the strategy of transition to cope with certain feeling be be use more widely  Nobody go through all this trouble just because they saw it online  at least nobody I know  and an awful lot of woman in my life have seek transition at one time or another  Everyone have their own reason  For me  some of the big one be gendered rejection  sexual trauma  difficult dynamic at home  be entirely isolate from lesbian  especially butch lesbian  role model and community  see boy with similarly ADDlooking issue treat with much more understanding than I ever be  stuff like that  I need help find a healthy lesbian community  resource for cop with be female and ADD  and support learning to live with sexual trauma  Just lock up my laptop wouldn \u2019 t have help me get those need meet  All it would have do be change the direction of my selfdestructive shitspiral for a while  at least  Basically  I would like to see more care take in these discussion  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 BORN WRONG"}
