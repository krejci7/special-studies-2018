"tags": ["Uncategorized"], "text": "Was I ever really trans  This depend how you define trans  For the purpose of this post  let \u2019 s try two common one  The first one be the definition that be more or less common usage within the transgender community I participate in  In this community  \u201c transgender \u201d be use to describe anyone who identify a trans  It be also use to describe anyone  celebrity  historical figure  fictional character  etc  who hadn \u2019 t explicitly state they be not trans  as long a they \u201c seem trans \u201d  a totally subjective matter  although gender nonconforming people \u201c seemed trans \u201d an awful lot more often   The other be the medical definition  From the DSMV  quote from crashchaoscat \u2019 s helpful post with the exact text \u201c Gender dysphoria refers to the distress that may accompany the incongruence between one \u2019 s experience or express gender and one \u2019 s assign gender \u201d I be trans  as much a anybody else ever be  I identify a trans and have diagnose dysphoria  The feeling that be diagnose that way absolutely do exist  and continue to exist  although I understand them differently now  I seek and obtain legal and medical transition measure  I be see by a half dozen different mental or physical health professional in a context relevant to my transition  all of whom be convince I be transgender  There be no trait I have that do not also exist in FTMs who do not stop transition or report negative outcome  I don \u2019 t describe myself a trans anymore  but by some definition  I could still be describe that way by others and still often be  People who have be introduce to me a a woman still ask me if I \u2019 m trans  Strangers online say that I \u2019 m just repress my true transgender self  Some legal and social complication due to legal identification form perceive  by oneself andor by others  a incongruous be also hold in common between many trans people and me  My passport still say male  at this time  Strangers generally assume I \u2019 m male  and be surprise by what they see a a disparate sex on my license  which I \u2019 ve change back to female  I haven \u2019 t get through the paperwork to change my sex back to female with my healthcare provider  this have lead to inconsistent pronoun in medical documentation I need to obtain disability accommodation  I experience a sense of alienation from my body and often wish many of my feature appear more maletypical  I can not function normally in clothes that I feel make my body appear more obviously female  due to the amount of distress my appearance cause me under those circumstance  I be deeply upset by how female my face look when I shave my facial hair  Despite this  the relief I get from actually make my body appear more maletypical be fleeting  and my quality of life have improve dramatically since stop transition  The premise  \u201c people who detransition be never trans \u201d  be frequently assume to be freestanding  with no defense provide  This be convenient to those who be highly invest in dismiss detransitioned woman a credible witness to our own life  but ignore the many  many point of similarity that tend to be hold in common between those who continue transition and those who find other way to cope  Women who detransition absolutely be trans at one time  at least accord to many definition  We all identify a trans and have a strong drive to pursue transition  in some form or another  at one point  Many of u be diagnose officially  There be not any common trait  or set of trait  that set u all apart from those who continue transition  The belief that only those who be not \u201c truly trans \u201d could experience relief through strategy other than transition put a whole lot of power in the hand of the professional who profit daily from the current framework  wherein transition be consider the only treatment for virtually anyone motivate to seek it persistently  In contrast  the belief that there be many potentially useful strategy for handle the experience diagnosable a dysphoria  alongside or instead of transition   many of which can be successful without any contact with mental health professional or physician  put more power in the hand of individual with those experience  In many way  this be analogous to the belief that someone who experience relief without utilize the psychiatric model of care be never really suffer  because those who be truly suffer require psychiatry to heal  Both empower doctor  at the expense of everyone experience direct psychological and physiological consequence from the choice those doctor make about their treatment  In both case  it make sense that professional tend to be emotionally invest in a narrative where their care be the only barrier between suffer and suicide  Seeing yourself a a savior feel really good  whereas see yourself a someone who sometimes do totally unnecessary harm feel pretty bad  Sunk cost bias applies to doctor and therapist as much a it apply to anyone else  I understand the resistance to what myself and other detransitioned woman be say  ",
