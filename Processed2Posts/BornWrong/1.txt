"\u201c Psychology suggest that only after heal yourself can you begin to heal the world  We disagree  People do not have to be perfectly functioning  selfactualized human being in order to create social change  Think of the lesbian and feminist you know who have be influential in the world  and who have work hard and effectively for social justice  have they all love and accept themselves  \u201d \u2013 Celia Kitzinger and Rachel Perkins  Changing Our Minds  Lesbian Feminism and Psychology I be so tired of people assume that I believe \u201c good \u201d therapist  or therapeutic guideline  be the solution to the existence of woman who stop transition  It \u2019 s a reflexive defanging of my actual position  which have often already be clearly state  I be deeply hostile to the concept of pay a professional to act a an authority figure regard my inner life  Avoiding therapist have do me an awful lot more good than go near them ever do  I read Changing Our Minds recently  a book by two lesbian train a psychologist  which argue that the whole concept of psychology contradicts many aspect of lesbian feminist politics  It be incredibly insightful and I really  really recommend it to any woman curious about the detail of the position I \u2019 m talk about in this post  From a section title Therapy Is Wrong  Therapy be take over our everyday live a lesbian  Although we have criticize many individual therapist and therapist in this chapter  our main objective have be to point out that the very idea of therapy be wrong  We do not think the situation be improve by \u2018 ethical guideline \u2019 for therapist  however efficiently these be enforce  because we think therapy in and of itself be a fundamentally unethical enterprise\u2026 if something be bad  it doesn \u2019 t become \u2018 good \u2019 just because more people have access to it  The fundamental problem be not the abuse some therapist perpetrate  nor the racist  classist  and ableminded condition of access to therapy  although all those thing be problem too   The fundamental problem be the nature of therapy itself  We would like lesbian to know the difference between therapy and feminism  even if they sometimes still choose therapy   We would like lesbian to believe that most of u  most of the time  be strong and capable human being who do not need to be \u2018 cure \u2019 \u2026and that on those occasion when we be not strong and capable  we are or should be  could be able to take care of each other  To the extent that we be not  that be an indictment of our movement \u201d I agree with this  I know others who say they \u2019 ve benefit from therapy  and I \u2019 m not argue that they didn \u2019 t  At it best  therapy resembles friendship  and some friendship be incredibly helpful  but be license a a counselor of some kind in no way guarantee that someone be capable of help another person  I suspect that the people who \u2019 ve get a lot out of therapy would have get even more from an actual friendship with that same therapist  on equal footing  Providing support to each other should be a primary function of community  Outsourcing our need might feel very necessary  and on an individual scale  I wouldn \u2019 t fault any woman for feel the need to do so  On a broad scale  though  rely on pay professional to help u take away part of what drive u to work together  and can easily cause u to personalize what we face to the exclusion of politicize it  Another one of the idea in this book that really get me be that  in many way  how we feel isn \u2019 t always necessarily that important  and eternally turn inward to try and resolve the problem you see a personal can be consider an action that run contrary to feminist belief  \u201c When I first heard    that Gloria Steinem didn \u2019 t have selfesteem  my reaction be  \u201c Who care  Look what she \u2019 s do with her life  It \u2019 s the life that matter in the end \u201d \u2013 C Sternhell  a quote in Changing Our Minds I be floor when I read this  It have never occur to me to question the inherent importance of constantly examine every detail of our inner life  I felt like the more issue I have  the less politically effective I could be  In some way  yeah  problem like be unwilling to go outdoors in daylight have have material consequence  in term of what I can do for other woman  Even then  though  I didn \u2019 t start go outside more often because of psychologist  Initially  I start go outside more because I get a dog to help me with certain stuff and be train her for public access  I get more resilient about how other people saw me because my belief change around the meaning of my appearance and how others interpret it  That resistance to leave the house be not a \u201c personal problem \u201d  either it be a direct consequence of be tell by the trans scene I be in that be see one way or another be suppose to feel validating  and my gradual realization that  at the time  there be no way others could view me that didn \u2019 t make me feel sick  I find relief through practical change in my circumstance and through shift my ideological framework  Basically\u2026 the idea that public accomplishment could matter more than one \u2019 s internal world  past or present  be really free to me  Shortly after I read this book  I learn about a woman whose life really exemplify that concept  Pauli Murray  a black lesbian who overcome huge institutional barrier to help found NOW  contribute to the Brown v Board of Education victory  write paper use to uphold the ERA  organize influential early protest against segregation  and much  much more  The same New Yorker article that write glowingly of Murray \u2019 s many success also devote a few hundred word to a more private struggle of hers  Murray \u2019 s complicate feeling about be female a a black lesbian in the 1900s be distil to \u201c Murray  the passionate advocate for woman \u2019 s right  identify a a man \u201d This position seem to be base on the interpretation of Murray \u2019 s document find in Rosalie Rosenberg \u2019 s book  Jane Crow  The Life of Pauli Murray  It \u2019 s note that Murray seek transition well before the 1960s but do not find medical service available  What  then  of the rest of Murray \u2019 s life  She die in 1985  FTM transition be not so inaccessible by then  at least not for a tenured professor  The simpler explanation be that Murray find a way to live without transition  as necessary a it may have felt at some point  Murray  for her part  write her own autobiography that make no mention of these issue  Rosenberg \u2019 s interpretation a represent in this article  that a woman who seek transition at one point must not be a woman after all  speaks of a fundamental misunderstanding of the social force impact woman  and possibly of a lack of intellectual honesty concern the life and work of other woman  These same quality be evidence in an early project of Rosenberg \u2019 s  a describe in Susan Faludi \u2019 s Backlash   testify against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of the Sears corporation  She state that their female employee be consistently pass over for highpaying commission sale position because this be the \u201c natural effect \u201d of woman \u2019 s \u201c difference \u201d  and that to mistake this sexbased discrepancy in hire for sexism be \u201c naive \u201d  Rosenberg be friendly with the Sears chief defense lawyer  who have once employ her exhusband  In prepare her testimony  she choose not to speak with any woman employ at Sears  \u201c In form her opinion on this case  Rosenberg didn \u2019 t conduct any independent research  She didn \u2019 t talk to any actual saleswoman or interview any female employee at Sears  \u2018 I just pretty much rely on what  the Sears legal team  give me \u2019 To help the Sears lawyer  she cull evidence from other scholar \u2019 book  evidence that she say show that woman traditionally prefer \u2018 different \u2019  more female type of job  She hand over this material to the Sears lawyer  They write her court statement for her  she says\u2013 then hand her the complete brief to sign  \u2026When the EEOC lawyer receive a copy of the write testimony  they pass it on to KesslerHarris for her comment  \u2018 This be not an argument that any reasonable historian would make  \u2019 KesslerHarris recall think at the time\u2026 When Rosenburg do proceed to court  KesslerHarris agree to testify for the EEOC to correct the record on her own writing  In court  KesslerHarris point out where Rosenberg have twist the meaning of her work  mostly through the creative use of ellipsis  For example  Rosenberg have quote KesslerHarris a say that woman quit industrial job in drove after the WWII a historical evidence woman have \u2018 choose \u2019 not to hold traditional male job  But she skip over the part where KesslerHarris say woman hadn \u2019 t willingly abandon their post  but have be force out to make way for return soldier  Rosenberg have take similar liberty with the work of other scholar  One of the distortion of Phyllis Wallace \u2019 s study of the AT  T case be so egregious that  when challenge in court  Rosenberg retract it and ask it to be expunge from the record  \u2018 It be a mistake  \u2019 she say now  make in the rush of compile her evidence for Sears \u201d Susan Faludi  Backlash I \u2019 m glad I be read Backlash when I find out about Rosenberg \u2019 s interpretation of Murray \u2019 s experience  the context Faludi provide regard the nature in which Rosenberg have approach \u201c scholarship \u201d in the past be really helpful  When someone else write your story  they can say whatever they want about what your feeling mean  but they can only misrepresent your action to the extent that they be never document honestly  I agree wholeheartedly with Sternhell \u2013 it \u2019 s the life that matter in the end  Murray be amaze either way  and her emphasis on take action rather than view herself a the problem be an inspiration  Seeing my own pain a political can make me feel hopeless at time  because it reveal the overwhelming extent of what \u2019 s wrong with our society  but view my problem a purely personal be what actually remove all hope for change  I don \u2019 t want to do that  Identifying what \u2019 s go wrong be the first step to formulate a coherent strategy of resistance  ", "feedtitle": "BORN WRONG"}
