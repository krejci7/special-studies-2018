already be pay and can not be recover  For example  a business may have invest a million dollar into new hardware  This money be now go and can not be recover  so it shouldn \u2019 t figure into the business \u2019 s decision make process  Or  let \u2019 s say you buy ticket to a concert  On the day of the event  you catch a cold  Even though you be sick  you decide to go to the concert because otherwise \u201c you would have waste your money \u201d  Boom  You just fell for the sunk cost fallacy  Sure  you spend the money already  But you can \u2019 t get it back  If you aren \u2019 t go to have a good time at the concert  you only make your life worse by go  From psychologytodaycom  also lol\u2026   You justify \u201c rid a loser \u201d or get stick on what you already have because you fear that walk away would mean that you waste your time or money  you make a mistake  people will now say  \u201c I tell you so \u201d  or you will then conclude  \u201c I must be bad at make decision because this one didn \u2019 t work out \u201d  If you recognize any of this in yourself then you be suffer from commitment to sink cost  You be try to recover your investment by hold onto it because you can not accept it be no longer work  I \u2019 ve know about this concept since before my transition  I would read my dad \u2019 s economics book a lot a a teenager  I studiously avoid apply it to my transition  as far a I can remember  until last year  I didn \u2019 t connect the two until around this time  Juneish  last year  when I be describe myself a a \u201c gendercritical transman \u201d  I be become increasingly aware of the way that transition a a strategy have fail to make me feel any good  I also be realize that  if transition be mean to be a real choice  there have to be other option  I shouldn \u2019 t experience such overwhelming distress at the entirely hypothetical concept that I could possibly ever realize it wasn \u2019 t the best choice  I start recognize that my distress undermine the narrative I be try desperately to talk myself back into  I feel this process be relate to both to sink cost fallacy and to both denial and bargaining a stage of grief  It be incredibly uncomfortable  force myself to actually stay present with those feeling  It felt like torture  I be so used to run from feeling like that  I just couldn \u2019 t stand the dissonance anymore  The more I actually let myself talk  the more I could finally tell that what I be try to talk myself into didn \u2019 t make any sense  From griefcom  Denial be the first of the five stage of grief  It help u to survive the loss  In this stage  the world become meaningless and overwhelming  Life make no sense  We be in a state of shock and denial  We go numb  We wonder how we can go on  if we can go on  why we should go on  We try to find a way to simply get through each day  Denial and shock help u to cope and make survival possible  Denial help u to pace our feeling of grief  There be a grace in denial  It be nature \u2019 s way of let in only as much a we can handle  As you accept the reality of the loss and start to ask yourself question  you be unknowingly begin the healing process  You be become strong  and the denial be begin to fade  But a you proceed  all the feeling you be deny begin to surface  After a loss  bargaining may take the form of a temporary truce  \u201c What if I devote the rest of my life to help others  Then can I wake up and realize this have all be a bad dream  \u201d We become lose in a maze of \u201c If only\u2026 \u201d or \u201c What if\u2026 \u201d statement  We want life return to what be be  we want our love one restore  We want to go back in time  find the tumor sooner  recognize the illness more quickly  stop the accident from happening\u2026if only  if only  if only  Guilt be often bargaining \u2019 s companion  The \u201c if onlys \u201d cause u to find fault in ourselves and what we \u201c think \u201d we could have do differently  We may even bargain with the pain  We will do anything not to feel the pain of this loss  We remain in the past  try to negotiate our way out of the hurt  People often think of the stage a lasting week or month  They forget that the stage be response to feeling that can last for minute or hour a we flip in and out of one and then another  We do not enter and leave each individual stage in a linear fashion  We may feel one  then another and back again to the first one  This time last year  I be spend an awful lot of time in denial  carve my way out of it gradually through engage with a very confusing and frustrating bargaining process  It wasn \u2019 t fun at all  The process remind me of that kid \u2019 s song\u2026 \u201c can \u2019 t go over it  can \u2019 t go under it  get to go through it \u201d  I didn \u2019 t know what I would find  It be so fucking scary  From Science Translational Magazine  But they keep on go  because after all  we \u2019 ve come so far  Spent so much time  Surely there have to be something come that will make good on all this effort  Not in those case  and not in a lot of others  An economist  or a behavioral psychologist  might tell you that the way to handle a sunkcost situation be to ignore the amount of effort  time  and money that \u2019 s be spend  As painful a it might be  those aren \u2019 t really that relevant  Treat the project a if it \u2019 s just drop out of the sky in it current form and land on your desk  Look at the situation a it be right now \u2013 do you want to go on  or not  That \u2019 s pretty much what go off testosterone come down to  for me  I didn \u2019 t want to go on  I have know for two month that I want to stop  If I wasn \u2019 t miss any injection  I can \u2019 t remember if I be  that mean I inject myself 4 time for no reason except that I couldn \u2019 t admit I be wrong to have ever take this shit  Considering how much I hat selfinjecting  this really speak to how mixed up I be  I never mind needle in general but do it myself suck and I absolutely hat it  I didn \u2019 t understand it when they train me at all  I retain so little of the information  I be mostly guess and go off FTM YouTube video  I didn \u2019 t have the stomach to do an intramuscular injection quickly  I be terrify of hit bone and have no practice with anything like this  I would put the needle in so slowly and then convince myself it \u201c felt wrong \u201d and make myself start over again  usually 210 time  Closer to the end  it always felt wrong  I \u2019 d have all these little hole from where I \u2019 d be jam that needle  I would look at them and feel like there be some lesson I be suppose to be learn from that mess  and then I \u2019 d go distract myself with something so I \u2019 d forget all about those feeling  That Psychology Today article from early also have a set of question and tip to talk you through make decision about sunk cost  This would have be pretty helpful to me last year  In a recent study practice 15 minute of mindfulness meditation be helpful in make a decision to give up on a sunk cost  So  start by step back  breathe slowly  watch your breath go in and out  pay attention to your mind  and let go of judgment  Practicing slow down your thinking be an important step in make good decision  Once that you have slow down your thinking you can consider the following  \u2022 If you be decide again to make that purchase or get into that relationship  would you make the same decision  Why not  \u2022 If you lose that suit or dress  would you go out and buy the same one again  Why not  \u2022 Are you sacrifice other opportunity because you be stick with the sunk cost  For example  be you give up the possibility of other relationship or work or study by stick with something that be lead nowhere  What be the opportunity cost of your commitment to a past decision  \u2022 Could it be that the benefit of your choice decrease over time while the cost increase  If so  have the tradeoff  costsbenefits  change  \u2022 Did you not have all the information when you make the initial decision but nowwith new information\u2014it be clear that this be not what you expect  \u2022 Are you try to prove that you be right  even if it keep you commit to the wrong decision  Is it more important to be right than to be happy  \u2022 If you be observe someone else in the same predicament  would you recommend that they stay with their sunk cost or get out  We be usually much good at give up sunk cost in advise someone else because we be not try to justify our own behavior  We be talk about someone else  \u2022 Could abandon a sunkcost be the sign of good decision make rather than bad decision making  All of u have make decision that don \u2019 t work out\u2014but a key element in good decisionmaking be in know when to quit  \u2022 Do you admire a good decision maker who have give up on a bad investment  Knowing when to fold be the sign of good poker  \u2022 Are you overestimating the importance of shortterm discomfort in give up the sunk cost  Is it possible that the initial discomfort will give way to relief  \u2022 Have you give up on sunk cost in the past  Are you glad that you get out while you could  Did anything positive follow from give up  ", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 BORN WRONG"}
