hook me up with a very cool opportunity to share my perspective about why I detransitioned with a large group include a lot of medical and mental health professional serve the transgender community  I \u2019 m super excite about it  The topic and time limit make complete sense for the presentation she \u2019 s work on  but when I finish make my video  there be a lot I want to clarify that didn \u2019 t fit inside 3 minute talk  So here \u2019 s a long version of the script I write for that video  At the time when I start to detransition  I be already get a lot of relief from cop strategy other than transition relationship with animal  spend a lot of time in nature  connect with other woman with similar experience  and be in a supportive relationship and have a home environment where I be able to relax  On some level  when I be transition at 16  I have think of \u201c be a woman \u201d a everything I wasn \u2019 t pretty  compliant  content with the way i be treat a a woman and with my female body  I think that woman didn \u2019 t ever hate their body the way I do or believe they \u2019 d be good off a a man  This isn \u2019 t true  I learn many woman  especially lesbian  have experience period of want to be men in intense and visceral way  way that meet the diagnostic criterion for GID or gender dysphoria  but be eventually really glad that they have instead make peace with themselves a one type or another of unconventional woman  I learn  from connect with other woman  that womanhood could hold woman like me  I could be a woman even though I have a mastectomy and didn \u2019 t really like shaving and would generally rather be call Max than Abigail  I  re  learn that I \u2019 m a lesbian  People supportive of transition tend to think I \u2019 m some kind of nonbinary now  andor that transition be just another colorful stop on my rainbow of a gender journey  It seem like these people be more invested in fit my experience into a framework where they doesn \u2019 t challenge any preexisting belief than in actually hear what I have to say  Women can go through FTM transition  and they may not ultimately describe it a a positive experience  even if they be once enthusiastic about it  I love the WPATH Standards of Care  I use them to selfadvocate in medical office a a teenager who meet the diagnostic criterion for GID  believe I \u2019 d kill myself if they didn \u2019 t give me what I need  I didn \u2019 t know there be way to get relief from those feeling that didn \u2019 t come from a therapist  endocrinologist  or surgeon  I generally refuse to talk to my old gender therapist about anything except want to transition  Transition absolutely have some benefit for me  At the time I transition  give my lack of alternative coping strategy  inability to trust any mental health professional  and the fact that I do not have access to the support of peer go through something similar  it be possible that the high level of distress I experience on a regular basis might have be more likely to result in suicide attempt or completion  have I not transition  Passing  hormone  and my double mastectomy facilitate repression of trauma incur a a result of misogyny and the culturewide hatred of lesbian  Not have breast or be otherwise visually identifiable a female by stranger make it much easy to stop think about the shitty way others have treat me for be a butch lesbian  at least for a few year  Having a set of step to focus on complete in order to acquire some peace of mind give me hope and a sense of direction for a while  until I have complete all the step I have want to accomplish and be extremely disappointed to find myself still face pretty much the same issue I have a a teenager  Here \u2019 s a post I write about why I feel that so many people believe it \u2019 s either transition or suicide indicate that professional serve transgender population be let them down in huge way  I have be diagnose a fair amount of thing  in term of mental health  Even so\u2026 I haven \u2019 t talk to a doctor or mental health professional for anything except a bad flu and some phone call to renew my Adderal prescription in a couple year  and I feel well than I can remember ever feel in the past  The dynamic of relate to another person a an expert on my body andor my problem be something I avoid whenever practical now  and it \u2019 s work out pretty great for me  I count myself a extremely lucky that I have misgiving about the hysterectomy I be about to schedule a while before I stop transition  I be extremely grateful that  at this point in my life  I can usually stay far away from the field that I feel do me an awful lot of harm  The history of psychiatry be riddle with example of medicalpsychiatric abuse of noncompliant woman that be once regard a revolutionary  Treatments now widely regard a unethical be sometimes even seek after by individual experience really tough stuff  An awful lot of my friend who have detransitioned or be otherwise reconcile with their femaleness be lesbian  Our story be not unrelated to other historical medical treatment intend to \u201c cure \u201d noncompliant behavior in woman  I know others who feel their transition be lifesaving  That \u2019 s their story and they \u2019 re free to tell it  just like I be free to tell the same story when I believe it to be true  Now  this be my story  I understand why someone would feel transition save their lifeDo others understand that transition can also do profound harm  I didn \u2019 t stop transition because I \u201c be never trans \u201d  I stop because I find other way of cop that work good  do less damage  and in my case  allow me a high degree of autonomy in that I no longer rely on anything from endocrinologists a luxury not afford to those who receive hysterectomy a a part of their transition  During my own transition  I be not discernibly \u201c less trans \u201d than any of the other FTMs I know then  a indicate by the fact that a WPATH member write the letter allow me to access medical treatment  and the reputable Dr Curtis Crane be willing to remove my breast for cash  There be no screen protocol that would effectively prevent woman like me from access transition without also exclude individual who wouldn \u2019 t have stop transition  I doubt there be anything my therapist could have say to dissuade me from transition  either  I can \u2019 t experience a trusting relationship with someone who be obviously in a position of authority over me  Detransition wasn \u2019 t force on me by anyone  or by any circumstance  Realizing I could stop transition be extremely challenge at first I have year of unexpressed emotion to work through when those wall start come down  Ultimately  though  reconcile with my femaleness have be profoundly heal for me  A lot of detransition  for me  have be about listen to myself  and learn to take the pain I experience a a result of transition seriously  Paying Dr Curtis Crane to cut away healthy tissue from my body  be see a a man when I \u2019 m not one  side effect from testosterone\u2026 I can name the way they hurt me now  I be grateful for the perspective transition have give me on how the medicalindustrial complex fail woman and girl in pain  ", "feedtitle": "BORN WRONG"}
