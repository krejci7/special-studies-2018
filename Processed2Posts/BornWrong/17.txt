"text": "Hey  um  so\u2026 a lot of different feeling  I want to talk a little bit about how I experience pass  a a man and I mean I still experience it  you know  because people  people don \u2019 t really know what to make of this\u2026 um\u2026 at first  I start pass about six month or so after I get my mastectomy  because I get a round little face  And it take a long time for my voice to even drop as much a I do  I have  uh  I be pretty shrill\u2026 um\u2026 so  when I first start passing  it be pretty cool  uh  it be really cool  I felt like I be become this new person who could have an easy life  I felt like I be recreate myself  I was\u2026 I don \u2019 t know  um  I felt like I be be see  And\u2026 the long it go  the less I felt like that  The more time I spend with men think I be men  be treat the way men treat other men  and woman treat me the way they treat men\u2026 it be intensely distress  It do not feel like I be be see  Once I realize what other people mean when they saw me that way  and what that mean to them  whether or not they would have define it the way I do or even notice they be treat me differently\u2026 it \u2019 s a lot  Like  I  I \u2019 ve done\u2026 I work in group home  I \u2019 ve do work in group home for a while  and when I be a man \u201c when I be a man \u201d  I mean  I wasn \u2019 t ever a man  But when people think I be a man  they expect me to clean so much less  People be so much nicer to me  You know  I \u2019 m  kind of mental healthwise  I \u2019 m kind of a shitshow  Um  and  um  people be so much more patient about attention deficit stuff  like about need help  need them to explain thing  and go over stuff when I screw stuff up\u2026 people be so much more patient with me  When I be like  kind of nervous socially  people would go out of their way to try and make me feel comfortable  in a way that I have never experience before  you know  in my life a a woman who look like a lesbian  And  um  go back\u2026 I mean  it \u2019 s  you know  people treat me differently again  People  I\u2026 you know  I tell my coworkers  I make them transfer me site and everything  I told\u2026 my supervisor and everybody  that  you know\u2026 \u201c woman all along \u201d \u2026 I goofed\u2026and so  now I \u2019 m back to work in an environment where everyone know I \u2019 m a woman  And the expectation be high again  you know  people want me to clean more  people be passive aggressive when I forget to clean  you know  it \u2019 s different  you know  And group home be kind of interesting  the one I work in  because it \u2019 s kind of\u2026 obviously it \u2019 s very different  but in some way it \u2019 s kind of similar to a family environment  in that there \u2019 s a lot of like  domestic labor  and like  emotional labor  be big thing  that you \u2019 re help these people with their problem and talk to them  And like  the expectation on me in this environment  be wildly different when people think I \u2019 m a man versus when I \u2019 m not  People expect so much more emotional work from me  and like  support for people emotionally from me\u2026 the people I support too  expect more from me when they think I \u2019 m a woman than when I \u2019 m a man  Um\u2026 yeah  it \u2019 s just a trip  And you know  woman be scar of you  the way they \u2019 re scar of men  And that make to be scar of men  and it make sense to be scar of me when you think I \u2019 m a man  but shit\u2026 I guess  I don \u2019 t know  Part of transition for me was I mean  I don \u2019 t know if it be part of transition exactly  But\u2026 I don \u2019 t know  Part of be a lesbian to me  and I think for other lesbian but especially if you look  you look more butch  is\u2026 this fear of be like a man  of be scary  of be predatory  of be dangerous  And have other people reinforce to me that I be a man  and reinforce to myself that I be a man  and have it reinforce to me that it \u2019 s correct when other people treat me like a man\u2026 that do not do me any favor  Um\u2026 because I \u2019 m not  that \u2019 s not the reality  it \u2019 s just not true  There be a time when I want that to be true  and\u2026 even then  it wasn \u2019 t true  I \u2019 m not  I \u2019 m not a man  Um\u2026 and  you know  as intensely a pass felt like be see at first  be exactly how intensely I feel erase now  I  it \u2019 s  I don \u2019 t know  I mean  I felt like I be do the right thing  and even like  a couple month before I stop transition  I would have tell you  you know  this be who I be  I can \u2019 t help it  Um\u2026 but  obviously that didn \u2019 t play out  So yeah  Um\u2026 I guess just\u2026 feel like I haven \u2019 t see enough\u2026 you know  it \u2019 s obviously really hard to talk about  but I haven \u2019 t see a lot of conversation about how difficult passing can be emotionally  for someone who hasn \u2019 t grow up a a man  who hasn \u2019 t be teach that they deserve to be give all of the thing men be give at the expense of woman  Um\u2026 it just  it \u2019 s just  it \u2019 s just like finger in the wound  of like  you know  you do not deserve\u2026 this be not  this be not for you  This be for men  It just feel like\u2026 I don \u2019 t know  it just remind me  it just remind me\u2026 you know  that\u2026 that wasn \u2019 t how people saw me  that wasn \u2019 t what  deep down  these people would think of me  if they know I be female  They would not think  that  you know  that I deserve all this help  I be get this nice treatment because they think I be someone I be not  And you know  I couldn \u2019 t talk about my childhood  You know  I \u2019 d tell\u2026 I have sister  I have all these story about my sister  and it \u2019 s really hard to talk about your relationship with your sister  when everyone think you \u2019 re a man  you know  you can \u2019 t talk about Girl Scouts  you know  there \u2019 s so much shit  there \u2019 s just so much shit  Couldn \u2019 t talk the only girl on cross country  I couldn \u2019 t talk about be the only girl on cross country  there \u2019 s just all these part of my life  that  you know  you can \u2019 t just\u2026 you know  it \u2019 s not like a video game  you can \u2019 t just change the gender  change the pronoun  and the story stay intact  Nothing make any it doesn \u2019 t  it doesn \u2019 t work anymore  I can \u2019 t just\u2026 I don \u2019 t know  I don \u2019 t know  Um\u2026 yeah  And I mean  I still get  I still get read a male all the time now  But it \u2019 s different  um  now that I can\u2026 now that I \u2019 m not so dependent on other people to see me  Now that I know what I be  regardless of what someone else see or doesn \u2019 t see  Having some stability in my selfconcept  like  make a huge difference  I don \u2019 t  you know  I don \u2019 t\u2026 obviously I be \u201c misgendered \u201d  you know  people call me a man all the fucking time  you know  I go to the store  whatever  Um\u2026 but\u2026 it doesn \u2019 t change what I know about myself  it doesn \u2019 t shake me in the same way  It set off\u2026 it make me kind of  you know  make me have to think about  and do some more processing  do some feeling work  about old feeling  of what it felt like to pass  while I believe that make me a man inside  and this be a true and honest reflection of myself  um\u2026 but\u2026 it doesn \u2019 t\u2026 it doesn \u2019 t get to me in the same way anymore  um  that it use to  because I know what I be  I don \u2019 t know  it \u2019 s just kind of a weird  it \u2019 s a weird thing  Because obviously before transition  I didn \u2019 t like female pronoun  whatever\u2026whoo\u2026 um  but yeah  I mean  I hat she pronouns  I be all fuss about that  I be very work up about that  And that be about what they represent to me  The same way male pronoun distress me now  or I mean  distress me sometimes now  be about what they represent to me now  Um  my distaste for female pronoun be about what I think they mean  and the idea that I have hear and be tell over and over again  and that I believe  and do not question  about what it mean to be a woman  and that that be something that could not include me  Which I mean  you know  fair enough  Makes sense that I think that  I really hadn \u2019 t encounter community where a woman could be like me  where that wasn \u2019 t  you know  where I hadn \u2019 t spent time anywhere  where  you know  I wasn \u2019 t kind of a freak show  And\u2026 I don \u2019 t know  Getting to spend time in female space now  with  especially\u2026 the two time I \u2019 ve go to female  uh  event  be event that have a bunch of other  detransitioned and reconcile woman  like woman who have stop transition before or after take medical step  um\u2026 be around those lady and get to talk to everybody and be together  and not be  you know  not be such a fucking freak\u2026 make a huge difference  This be kind of a sidebar  I be try to talk about how it \u2019 s not fun to get see a a man  But yeah  um\u2026 kind of loop the hell around  It usedfor a while  I couldn \u2019 t stand either  I didn \u2019 t know what the fuck I be gon na do  you know  \u201c nonbinary \u201d  so to speak  But it really just turn out that I need to do more  do more thinking\u2026 with my girlfriend who also use  she use it pronouns  for years\u2026 we love each other  We be both trans when we meet  But yeah  we just have to do more thinking and processing  and  you know  feeling work about what those pronouns meant to u  So yeah  uh  those be my thoughts\u2026 later  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 BORN WRONG"}
