"text": "So after watch Maria Catt \u2019 s video and Kat \u2019 s video I decide to make one too\u2026 end up make three  I \u2019 m prolific  Here \u2019 s the first one  Hey  Um  I \u2019 m Max  um  so I watch Maria Catt \u2019 s video  and she \u2019 s great  wish her the best  um  and  she talk about  mention that people have a lot of feeling about have mastectomy  and  I myself be someone with a lot of feeling about have a mastectomy  and I know that there \u2019 s a lot of stuff out there that talk about how great it be  and I make stuff like that  when I think mine be really great  and when I think this have go really good  Um  so I just kind of want to talk about my experience with that  Um  initially what I want to do be film this somewhere pretty  because it \u2019 s not really a pretty conversation  but um  it \u2019 s kind of windy  so instead I \u2019 m do it in my dusty shed  So yeah  I want surgery initially I mean I start want surgery when I start want to transition  I  I think it would help  basically  I be uncomfortable with my chest in a really profound way  I really do not like look at myself or think about what I look like  I REALLY do not like other people look at me or think about what I look like  I think that top surgery would help  I guess  be kind of  the main reason why I do that  I keep think that for year afterwards  for three year  I think it have help  And kind of\u2026 you know  the reality of that be  that what it help me do be think about my chest le  because there be nothing there  When you \u2019 ve get a flat chest  there \u2019 s not a many logistical concern that you need to address  so it \u2019 s easy minutetominute  to not think about my chest  Um  it do NOT make me more comfortable with what be there  Even immediately after surgery  I be pretty horrify by what it look like  Um  and you know  that \u2019 s the reality of surgery  be that it \u2019 s kind of gross to look at  Um  but I have assume it would be worth it  and I keep talk myself into that  um  narrative  that I be become who I need to be  that I have be bear wrong  and that there be this other person that I could become  who would have an easy life  who could be happy  So yeah  try to get back on track here  get a little notebook  So yeah  when I go in for surgery  I think it be go to be really great  I be really excite  this be what I want  I ask my surgeon the day of  when he be mark on my chest with marker  um  I ask where the tissue would go  I want to know if it be like Fight Club  in a trash can and shit  He say no  it get incinerate  and I be like yeah  I \u2019 m right  Um  and  everyone be really nice to me  everyone be really nice to me  When we get to the operating room  I be surprise by the kind of dentistlooking chair they have there  I think it would be a big flat silver table  and I express that to Dr Crane  Curtis Crane in San Francisco  and he be like what  it \u2019 s not a morgue  And I be like haha\u2026 I think this whole thing be all very funny  I be excite to experience go under anesthesia  And look back  that be not how I feel  It be terrify to me that that \u2019 s how I felt at the time  because to me that speak to how disconnected I be  from my body  and how little I care about what happen to me  And you know  this be a time in my life when I be regularly have intense suicidal ideation  and transition felt like an alternative to that  Like  I want to die I never actually you know  I want to die  but the reason I want to die be because I didn \u2019 t think I could have a good life  So with the prospect of transition  I think  hey  this be a way to have a good life  and not  um  kill myself  so you know  I be down for that  And I think that be a lot of what be a part of why  I be up for something as intense a surgery  So for a few year after my surgery  like I say  I be cool with it  in that I didn \u2019 t have anything negative to say about it  I didn \u2019 t look at my chest much  I didn \u2019 t think about my chest much  It be easy to detach myself from the way I have felt about my chest then  and from the way I felt about my chest now  which  whoo  I be not ready for that  I would occasionally you know  I would have thought and feeling about distress  with surgery  and confusion  and a lot of complicate feeling about my chest  but I wouldn \u2019 t engage with them  I wouldn \u2019 t think about it  I try really hard not to think about it  And actually  it be month after I have decide to stop transitioning at all  it be month after I have go off testosterone  that I felt really able to say that this surgery be something I regret  this wasn \u2019 t something I want to do  this wasn \u2019 t the way I want to live  And I feel  I think that the framework of grief be really relevant here  And you know  the way stage of grief work isn \u2019 t that you go through them in perfect order  How it work be that you kind of move around through them and sometimes you \u2019 re spend more time in one or the other  And I mean  before people start engage in that process  a lot of time where they be be denial  And that \u2019 s  that \u2019 s very understandable  this be a lot of fuck feeling to have  It \u2019 s really fuck intense  I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s wrong not to want to talk about this  But yeah  I spend a lot of time I mean  three year  guess it could have be longer  but it felt like a long time um  try to convince myself that what happen be okay  And it \u2019 s not  it \u2019 s not  I don \u2019 t feel okay  I don \u2019 t feel like what happen be okay at all  Um  I feel  like\u2026 it\u2026 I try talk about this with like  people who aren \u2019 t very familiar with the very specific kind of issue that be relevant here  Um\u2026 and a friend of mine tell me that what I be talk about sound like I should look into  like  lose a child  It feel  I mean  it \u2019 s a loss  It feel like  it feel like I kill a part of me on purpose  because I blame that part of me  for the mistreatment that be attract by my chest  You know  I feel like I be blame my chest for  the way I be treated I put a LOT on that part of my body  and I felt that  by remove my breast  I could remove those feeling  That you know  I could amputate  my uh  my fucking feeling  And unfortunately  you know  it would be super convenient if that be the case  I would so super love if that be true  For me it be not  it be not true at all  So\u2026 so\u2026 I mean I get all the feeling that lead me here in the first place  that lead me to transition and surgery  those feeling be still there  They \u2019 re not go  they \u2019 re not well at all  And now I \u2019 ve get all the extra shit that transition add  You know  for me right now  especially surgery be kind of what \u2019 s big for me  Yeah  I guess I just want to talk about that  that this doesn \u2019 t always turn out well  and I think it \u2019 s important to be realistic about that  that this may not go well  this may not be something you feel good about in three year  Even if you feel good in one year  even if you feel good in two year  I mean  I would have tell anyone that I be have a great fucking time  I would say yeah this isn \u2019 t something I regret  this be so awesome  I would argue with people about it  you know  I wasn \u2019 t different until I be  And a lot of that be that I \u2019 m in a place now  you know  I \u2019 m in a good relationship  I have a stable house environment  I have support online from other woman of these experience  I \u2019 m in a place where I can  where I \u2019 m safe enough to start unpack these feeling  I mean  if I be still\u2026 if I wasn \u2019 t with my girlfriend  you know  If I have be alone  and as isolate from lesbian community a we be right now  and a I have be for the last few year  um\u2026 I don \u2019 t think I would have figure this stuff out myself  I would have keep say my surgery be a great fucking decision  I would have felt stuff my feeling down  and have other problem because of that  I mean\u2026 I drink a lot more  I smoke a lot more  when I be try not to deal with those feeling  Actually  I\u2026 I think around six month after I have surgery  I had eight month after  I have like  a psychotic break  I lose it  You know  I think  alien be after me  and stuff  So you know  stuff that shit down didn \u2019 t really do me any favor  but you know  it do feel like my only option for a long time  So basically yeah  just\u2026 this wasn \u2019 t very organize  I write a bunch of really good note and then I just kind of\u2026 depart  depart from that  But yeah  Basically\u2026 it \u2019 s important to be realistic about how this might go  And you know\u2026 if you haven \u2019 t have surgery yet  and you \u2019 re idealize it  I think it \u2019 s important to seek out reality check  in term of how this might go  I\u2026 this do not go well for me  I feel like I lose a part of my body and like I lose the chance to do the really intense and challenging  but ultimately worthwhile  emotional work of figure out how to live with my body  the way it be  And now that \u2019 s go  And what I have the work that I can do be  figure out how to live with a body that be permanently mark by my desire to destroy it  You know  I  I have permanently make a part of my body  my hatred of it  And you know  I be into selfharm before  that \u2019 s not new exactly  but it \u2019 s kind of another level  it feel like  to me  in term of my own relationship to cut or burn myself  versus my chest be so different  It \u2019 s a lot  Um  and if  if this be something that you \u2019 ve already do  and you \u2019 re have complicate feeling about it  um  regardless of whether you \u2019 re intending to transition or whatever  we can talk about that  It \u2019 s  it \u2019 s a lot to be alone with it  You don \u2019 t have to  you know  we all make our own choice  There \u2019 s no pressure to  for you to deal with this the same way that I have  If you \u2019 re feel alone with this and want to talk about it  hit me up  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 BORN
