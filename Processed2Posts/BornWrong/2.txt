"text": "Am I still trans  regardless of how I choose to describe myself  I get this online and in real life  People who be familiar with transition a a concept have a hard time understand how someone could look butch with a visible history of medical transition and still acknowledge herself a a woman  On the other hand  those with less awareness of transition accept pretty readily that I \u2019 m an unusuallooking woman  whether they like it or not  Anyway\u2026 when these more socially aware coworkers or friend ask me if I \u2019 m transition to become a man  this be generally a question intend to be sensitive and considerate  I reiterate what I \u2019 ve generally already state pretty clearly  I \u2019 m a woman  Then they tell me about each individual trans person they \u2019 ve met and I nod politely  This interaction sometimes happen more than once with the same person  Online  it tend to be less a question and more an accusation ie  \u201c such a repressed trans man lol \u201d  etc  This come off a a reflexive dismissal that a woman could ever look like me  or live my life  Interestingly enough  online this tend to come from people who would generally tell you that trans people be exactly the gender they identify a  I guess that selfdetermination end when you start tell people you \u2019 re not trans anymore  With both people in town and stranger online  it seem like my identification with my femaleness be mainly in question because of how I look  If I make effort to hide the physical evidence of my history of transition  or my disinterest in assimilate with mainstream cultural expectation of womanhood  I \u2019 m pretty sure I \u2019 d hear this specific dismissal less often  Not that my description of my own life would get more respect if this be the case they so wouldn \u2019 t  But I think the strategy for prove my voice doesn \u2019 t matter might shift  \u201c You be never trans \u201d attempt to exclude me from my own experience with transition  \u201c You \u2019 re still trans \u201d attempt to exclude me from my sex  People who feel threaten by the perspective of detransitioned woman often seem to make strategic choice about how to attack an individual woman \u2019 s credibility in a give situation  It \u2019 s all very political Accusing a butch lesbian of want to be something other than a woman be a statement with a lot of baggage  Historical account include anecdote of homophobe say really similar shit  decade and decade ago  Then  like now  it demonstrate the speaker \u2019 s narrow idea about how woman should behave and cast any variation a pathological  And just to be clear  I don \u2019 t want to be a man  or a nonbinary person    not anymore  because I no longer hate be a woman  I use to  largely because I equate my own femaleness with the belief others express about what womanhood meant  beliefs I internalize in complex way that be difficult to untangle  I saw woman abuse by men  over and over  and I blame my own body for the way men \u2019 s action harm me  I believe transition would resolve the intense disconnecthatred for my own sex and general dysfunctionality I felt  I think I look and act the way I do because I be a man  and be mistake for a dyke be humiliate  That \u2019 s not the case now  Now  I understand my complicated feeling towards my physical self a an understandable reaction to living in a fuck up world  and I place the blame where it belong  with men  I try transition and saw that it do not fix me  because my body be never the problem  I still have really intense  challenging feeling about be female because I still live in a fuck up world and have a brain impact by past trauma  I can handle those feeling by talk it out with other woman  read about others who have be through similar stuff  exercise  spending time with animal  connect with nature  meditating  journaling  or use other tool  I see the way I have always prefer to dress and act not a an expression of an innately notwoman identity  but a an aspect of how I  personally  respond to the enormous pressure put on woman to look some specific way or another  I see it a part of my innately female self  I be no longer ashamed to have my similarity with other lesbian  include other butch lesbian  recognize  I value my connection to the trans community  I will always be visually identifiable a someone who once understood myself a a part of it  I will continue to encounter people who don \u2019 t believe me when I say I \u2019 m not trans  That doesn \u2019 t make me any less a woman  What happen to me happen to woman  I know  because I \u2019 m a woman  and it happen to me  These be conclusion I come to about my own life a a result of apply feminist consciousness raise principle in interaction with other woman with a history of transition  They be just as organic a the conclusion I come to about my own life when I apply what I have learn through transgender community  if not more so there \u2019 s a much wide diversity of opinion in my current circle than my old one  and an awful lot less policing of each other  I be encourage by transgender community to be open to change in how I understand my relationship with gender when I go from not know I be trans  because I \u2019 d never heard of it  to know I be trans  because the new information I have change how I understand my feeling about my body and social role  The same people who strongly encourage that type of question be often the one who be outrage by woman like me  who continue to question  and who eventually find some idea that work well for u than a lot of trans ideology do  ", "feedtitle": "BORN WRONG"}
