cousin to my last post  \u201c On Being \u2018 Sure \u2019 \u201d  Related to love one \u2019 fear about a transgender person be \u201c sure \u201d about transition be the fear that they may one day regret the transition or \u201c change their mind \u201d about be transgender  Yes  I hear this a lot  From doctor  from parent  It \u2019 s a valid concern  although I \u2019 m not sure the frequency with which it happen be correlate with the amount of concern about it  It seem that at first parent hope their child  either a youth or their adult child  will change their mind when a transgender identity be first reveal  Later  this thought turn into a fear a transition nears or progress  In my opinion  some of the fear and anxiety come from good intention  try to use their own perspective to understand  If they put themselves in the transgender person \u2019 s shoe  they would imagine not only would they \u201c change their mind \u201d  but they would want to \u201c switch back \u201d immediately  It \u2019 s really important to try to not use your own perspective in this situation if you have never once struggle with your gender identity  For as sure a you be about your gender identity  your transgender love one be likely just a sure about their gender identity  But what about the study   Oh  the study  The study that scare everyone  There be plenty of study that show gender nonconformity in childhood doesn \u2019 t persist  That even those who insist they be the \u201c other \u201d gender do not go on to transition  Keep in mind some of these study be write by doctor who be actively try to get the child to conform to their birth gender  Additionally  all the dynamic at play with the child \u2019 s gender identity be not know in those study  Not everyone follow the same path  Not everyone have the same personality  confidence  support system  encouragement  discrimination  access to resource  parent  community  ego strength  temperament  role model etc  All of these factor  and many more  can affect whether or not someone choose to transition  Someone may decide that have their body be different from their affirm gender identity be more distress than have their birth gender identity be different from their affirm gender identity  Everyone be different  People experience distress in different way and because of different thing  Just because someone choose not to transition  or later \u201c detransitions \u201d do not mean they be not transgender  It mean that they  or others in their life  decide transitioning be ultimately not the best choice for them  I believe that most of the childrenteensadults who say they be \u201c sure \u201d and then transition do not live to regret this decision  I have anecdotal evidence with my own client  Don \u2019 t believe me  In 2011  a man name Colin Close conduct a survey about how medicallyassisted transition affect the life of transgender people  The study examine the experience of 448 individual to identify the impact transition on gender dysphoria  quality of life  emotional wellbeing  personality trait  and sexuality  The outcome  94  of trans people report an improvement in their quality of life due to transition 96  answer that their sense of wellbeing improve 9 out of 10 respond that their overall personality improve due to transition 85  describe their emotional stability a \u201c improve \u201d  11  report no change  96  report an overall satisfaction with transition 97  report a satisfaction with hormone therapy 96  report satisfaction with chest surgery 90  report satisfaction with genital surgery You can download the full report here  Are there those that do change their mind and regret transition  Yes  there be  I can \u2019 t speak to exactly what dynamic lead to this  a only they know everything that go into all of their decision  However  I believe they deserve just as much support \u201c detransitioning \u201d a they do transition  It be their gender  It be their life  It be their journey  We a human  probably a selfprotective measure  tend to look at the \u201c bad case scenario \u201d and feel scar by risk associate with choice  no matter how small  It \u2019 s natural  However  those small percentage of thing often scare u from take the leap to do something we want to do  Let me use this a an example  what if the ratio of successful airplane flight to the number of airplane crash be roughly equivalent to the ratio of people who be satisfy about transition to those who regret it  If we all base our sense of safety on think about the small percentage of airplane crash  none of u would want to fly again  There a risk to much everything we do  and there be no guarantee  Yet with risk often come adventure  new possibility  fulfillment  joy  Think of transition a your love one spread their wing to fly  What about the kid  you say  They be not adult  How can they POSSIBLY make such a huge decision a this  Well  gender identity be not a decision  It be a way one be  For child who have show a persistent and consistent crossgender identification during childhood and express a strong desire to be see a the gender with which their brain identifies  they should be allow to do so  Transitioning be something one do about one \u2019 s gender identity if it doesn \u2019 t match one \u2019 s body  Parents and professional need to help youth access the resource they need to do so  that be the vehicle for support one \u2019 s true identity  not just a \u201c big decision \u201d  Bear with me for a moment while I expand upon the decision about marriage a a metaphor of sort for gender transition a I do in my last blog post  I don \u2019 t know what the current percentage be  but last I hear 50  of marriage end in divorce  50   That \u2019 s HALF of the people who decide to commit themselves to someone for the rest of their life  and essentially \u201c change their mind \u201d  I can tell you that be FAR high than the number of individual who will regret their gender transition  Now  do this mean we should increase the hoop one should jump through in order to get marry  Should one \u2019 s mental health be evaluate before enter into marriage and sign off by a licensed therapist  Does the person who be perform the marriage have to have some sort of guarantee that this marriage will last forever before conduct the ceremony  Of course not  If both party be enter into the marriage willingly and be able to make sound decision for themselves  they should have every right to do so  Informed consent be the name of the game when it come to get married  a it should be with gender transition  Is there a chance your love one may regret the decision  Yes  Is there a chance you may die the next time you get in your car or the next time you take an airplane flight  Yes  There be no guarantee  But I can say this  there be more risk associate with not transition or allow your child to transition that there be with transition  Acknowledge your fear but don \u2019 t let it hold you  or your loved one  back  Soon you \u2019 ll all be ready for takeoff  ", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013
