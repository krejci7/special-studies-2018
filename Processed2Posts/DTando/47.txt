and difficult process all the more so  He have be very visible and vocal in order to educate the public and pave the way for other transgender individual  As he say on the Oprah special  \u201c I \u2019 m do this because I want to try to help people\u2026I want to try to put a face on an issue that people don \u2019 t understand  That \u2019 s why I do this publicly \u201d And now to push himself further out of his comfort zone and appear on Dancing With the Stars\u2026 wow  My hat \u2019 s off to you  Chaz  He say something in response to a question from a fan about his mother Cher \u2019 s response to his transition that really stick with me  and I think it summarize an aspect of one \u2019 s gender transition beautifully  The fan say  \u201c I would think your mom would accept it real well  \u201d Chaz \u2019 s response  \u201c It \u2019 s hard for moms \u201d Yes  even Cher  Even the leatherwearing  bootyrevealing  sex symbolgay icon mom  This process be indeed hard for mom  likely for all parent and guardian  This element be something that be a large part of the work I do with my transgender client  Inevitably my job in therapy be part help the individual transition and process emotion that accompany that  part be help them cope with response from others and understand what the process might be like for their loved one  When become a parent  the prospect of one \u2019 s child become a different gender than originally think be not usually within one \u2019 s realm of possibility  Parents often begin plan  fantasizing  and formulate expectation for their child \u2019 s life as soon a they \u2019 re bear  often as soon a they be conceive  Gender play a big part in these expectation which then have to shift a great deal when the gender nonconformity or different gender identity be reveal  This come a a shock to most parent  and it can be difficult to wrap one \u2019 s brain around  particularly if the parent have not previously have experience with someone who be gender variant  Of course  response vary from one extreme to the other  Some parent get on board soon after hear their child verbally reveal their true gender identity  Although rare  this can be relate to see many sign of gender variance since early childhood  or sense an unknown source of distress and see the relief the gender revelation brings  Other parent fight it and resist for many year  struggle to have any type of acceptance  This be the more common response  likely due to the parent have to shift idea they have be formulate about their child \u2019 s life since the child be bear  There be also a distinct element of fear  fear they will \u201c lose \u201d their child  or that their child will become unfamiliar to them  This usually be not the case  posttransition often be easy than expect and realize their child be still the same person   but that \u201c What If  \u201d be sure powerful  I have sit in many a session and witness two people in pain  the transgender individual  want desperately to be accept and support in the daunt process of transitioning  and the parent  wish this be not true  want it to go away  Some of the feeling a loved one might feel be likely similar to feel the transgender person have already go through prior to disclose their gender identity or plan to transition  Many have walk through the fear  the wish away  the major adjustment to how life be go to change  If you be a gender variant person express your true gender or look to transition  and your mom  parent  or love one be struggle with it  take heart  Even though it \u2019 s hard for them  acceptance be possible  It may be close than you think  While you be on your own journey  your love one be on theirs  and all of you deserve compassion  patience  and tolerance  When you find yourself get discourage  remind yourself  \u201c It \u2019 s hard for  \u201d  fill in the blank with your loved one who be struggle  If you be a parent of a gender nonconforming child or adult  and you have struggle with negative feeling about your child \u2019 s gender expression or transition  be kind to yourself  No matter where you fall on the spectrum of acceptance  please don \u2019 t judge yourself for have feeling about this  It \u2019 s important you take care of yourself while take care of your child  Having feeling of fear  dread  sadness  or loss doesn \u2019 t make you bad  it make you human  Walking through these feeling to get to the other side be a part of the process  I can \u2019 t underscore the importance of get to the other side  though\u2026 and eventually be able to support your child \u2019 s decision with the unconditional love they absolutely need  no matter how old they be  The significance of the parentchild relationship be both what make this difficult on you  and why your acceptance be crucial to your child \u2019 s happiness  Ultimately  your acceptance will likely be one of the most important aspect on your child \u2019 s journey  So on this journey to acceptance and support  and anyone can get there    validate your feeling  find a place to be hear  talk to other parent in your situation  Because yes\u2026 it \u2019 s hard for mom  ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
