tease have become part of the social culture at school and often go on away from adult supervision  A gender variant child be even more susceptible to tease give that they tend to behave or dress in a way that can be unexpected by other child or deem by other child to be \u201c different \u201d  As most of u know  those that be \u201c different \u201d or in the minority be more likely to be tease  get tease more often  and often more severely than other child  You know that one tone of voice child use when tattle  \u201c MOOooomm  Johnny HIT Meeee  \u201d  It \u2019 s universal  I \u2019 m convinced kid be bear know how to use this voice  without ever have it model for them  Parents have a similar standard tonecadence when warn their child about natural and logical consequence to choice  \u201c Okaaayy  you can go on that water ride  but you \u2019 ll probably get soak and feel cold the rest of the day  \u201d  It just come with the parent territory  Letting your child choose behavior while warn possible ramification be a parent basic  Warning about be tease for be gender nonconforming get tricky  however  Being gender nonconforming be not a behavior  it be a way a person be  Warning about tease that may come from display a core characteristicsomething the child can not change be dangerous territory  Yes  the child can choose to act on or express their way of be  or choose to inhibit it  But they can not change be gender nonconforming or transgender  While I can appreciate and recognize a parent \u2019 s urge to warn and possibly prevent tease that may come from a way of dress  behavior  or interest  this can quickly be translate to shame and self doubt  The problem be  in these scenario we \u2019 re not talk about nosepicking or some other minor social infraction that a child can learn how to avoid  We \u2019 re talk about child be who they be  and who be do absolutely nothing wrong  \u201c Warning \u201d the child by say something like \u201c If you choose to play with \u2018 boy thing \u2019  you might get tease at school \u201d  \u201c Girls don \u2019 t usually have really short hair  so you might get tease  but you can cut it if you want \u201d  \u201c Boys don \u2019 t usually walk or talk like that  but if you want to go ahead  Just know you might get tease \u201d may not have the protective nature parent be go for  In fact  it may teach the child to prescribe to what others say be the best way for them to be  Remember my Oxygen blog  Much like you wouldn \u2019 t \u201c warn \u201d a child about be tease for wear an oxygen tank to combat oxygen deprivation  try not to warn your gender nonconforming child to avoid their natural gender expression  I want to again acknowledge that most parent be come from a very loving place when they explain what may lay ahead  My worry be that this can instill fear and dread in the place of blissful innocence  It may make the child LESS equip to deal with the tease that may come with be gender nonconforming  If my parent have sit me down a a child and say  \u201c Just so you know  little girl with hazel eye sometimes get tease  Some people think hazel eye be wrong and some people just don \u2019 t like kid with hazel eye  You can go ahead and wear those hazel eye to school  but just know you might get teased \u201d  I would have experience childhood differently  I may have be fearful to let my true eye color show  even though I couldn \u2019 t change it  I may have look at  or look away from  everyone I meet with just a little bit of suspicion or mistrust  I may have think  \u201c Is this one of the people who hate kid with hazel eye  \u201d  I may have choose to grow up wear sunglass  even indoors  Many parent warn their child about be gender nonconforming much in the same way  even though it \u2019 s not something the child can change  Yes  the child could change his or her behavior to HIDE who he or she really be  but that \u2019 s not what we want for our child  be it  Children become inhibit base on the response of others soon enough  So  what \u2019 s a parent to do  Parents can help their child by unconditionally support who they be on the inside so they know without a doubt I AM AWESOME JUST THE WAY I AM  This win \u2019 t prevent the pain associate with teasing  but it will help build the ego strength in the child so that he or she understand their basic worth doesn \u2019 t change base on what others say  If your child ask you if you think he or she may be tease for wear something  do something  etc  be honest  Say \u201c maybe \u201d  and then discuss how the child might best handle it  Communicate  even if you have to \u201c fake it \u201d  that you know your child will be ok even if he or she be tease  This energy be something they will absorb from you  If your child come home and report be tease  ASK QUESTIONS  you don \u2019 t have to be the one with all the answer  This will help you get a feel for how much understanding your child have about the reason behind the teasing  \u201c Why do you think they tease you about wear a skirt  \u201d \u201c Why do you think they say that  \u201d  Not what they be use to  they don \u2019 t understand  they feel differently  etc   At dinnertime  bedtime  etc  ask your child about the best and bad part of their day  If they report tease  process it with them  Talk with them about how it make them feel  and how they can take care of themselves when they have that feeling  Discuss and practice possible response base on the tease so they feel more equipped should it happen again  Last but not least  take care of yourself and your own feeling  Listening about your child be tease can be a very hard thing for a parent to take  Talk to your friend  talk to other parent  talk to a therapist  Remind yourself this be not something you can \u201c fix \u201d or prevent  but you be do right by your child by nurture his or her true self  ", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 Gender Blog by
