gender therapist for your child can be a daunt task  If you be in the process of look for a gender therapist  this mean there be already a lot go on in your family  Gender dysphoria or gender nonconformity can at time cause distress for parent and the child who be experience it  There doesn \u2019 t seem to be many of u out there  gender therapist who work with gender nonconforming youth   and I wish there be more  So once you \u2019 ve find one in your area  or relatively close to you   how do you know if the therapist be a \u201c good \u201d one  As with every profession and specialty  there be the good  the bad  and the ugly  If someone claim to be a gender \u201c expert \u201d  don \u2019 t just assume your hunt be over  Ask question  see below for a sample list  and go with your gut instinct  Ultimately  YOU be the expert on your child  After you have meet with the therapist for 13 time  reevaluate how the session be go for both you and your child  Is your child comfortable  Are you  If not  address your concern with the therapist  The therapist should be open to your feedback and be able to explain his or her reasoning behind the treatment method  If thing don \u2019 t change  begin your search again  Let the Client  Child  Lead As with any therapy  or reason for seek therapy  the gender therapist should not enter into therapeutic work with you and your family with an agenda  If you get the sense on the phone that they have their mind on accomplish something  such a get your child to transition or not transition   consider that a red flag  Every child and family be different  with a different story and different need  Some of the intervention and suggestion will be similar to those use with other family  but most will be tailormade to your family  Your child will be the best source of information re  their gender identity  Children of a very young age be aware of what gender they be  andor what gender expression they be comfortable with  You  the parent  s   will be excellent historian for how your child have express their gender from an early age  current significant behavior  etc  Of course  part of the gender therapist \u2019 s job will be work with the parent in regard to their feeling about their child \u2019 s gender nonconformity  and feeling about potential option for their child  Red Herrings Many parent see their child \u2019 s gender nonconformity AND a lot of other emotion and behavior  Some of these emotion and behavior will be relate to their child \u2019 s gender identity  others may not  Those that seem unrelated to the gender identity but may actually be symptom of the distress the gender nonconformity be cause be what I call \u201c red herring \u201d  The gender therapist can help you sift through some of these factor to find out what need to be address first  It be common for some emotion and behavior to be resolve once the gender identity be validate  One good way to narrow down what be really go on for your child be to focus on what seem to be cause the most distress  For example  if your child be have social skill problem  academic problem  gender nonconformityexpressions of gender identity that do not match his or her body  anger outburst  and anxiety  what seem to bring them the most mental distress  What do they talk about the most  What do they shed the most tear over  This be what need to be address first  Often time thing such a the anger outburstsacademic problem be what bring the parent the most distress  and therefore this be what the parent want address first  This may be like put a BandAid on something without treat the cause  In some case  it will be the therapist \u2019 s job to gently prevent you  the parentsguardians  from follow the red herring  If your gender therapist seem determine to only focus on these other thing  and not address the gender issue  this should also be a red flag for you  While you may feel some relief that the gender therapist be recommend hold off on make any major decision or be want to address everything else other than the gender identity  pay attention to what your gut be tell you  You know your child  If the therapist \u2019 s recommendation seem to bring your child more distress  something have go awry  Hormone SuppressionTherapy Your gender therapist may help you  and your child  explore whether or not your child be gender nonconforming or transgender  If the consensus be your child be the latter  your gender therapist can help you navigate the next step in your child \u2019 s journey  Your gender therapist can be your ally in decide if hormone blockerstherapy be the right decision for your child  and if so  when to start  Sometimes  make this move can help ease some of the other symptom that may have arise for your child  Many time the child may express be ready for hormone blocker or hormone before the parent feel ready  The gender therapist can help parent walk through many of the anxious and difficult feeling that may arise during this significant decisionmaking time  Structure of Sessions There be no exact science to how a gender therapist might structure their session with you  but in general there should be a good balance of meet with you and meet with your child  The therapist should meet alone with you a part of the assessment process and at other time a need throughout treatment  This be because you need to have free reign to say what you want to say about your child \u2019 s gender expression and your feeling about it  Your child should not hear all of your thought  opinion  and feeling about their gender expression or possible transgender identity  Children tend to try to take care of their parent and avoid cause their parent distress  therefore hearing statement make my parent  particularly those express resistance  can impact their ability to say what they want and need in regard to gender expression  transition  etc  This can have serious ramification on their mental health and future  Similarly  your child should have the opportunity to speak alone with the gender therapist and speak his or her mind without censor thing out of regard for his or her parent  The gender therapist will not tell you exactly what your child have say while in private  but should help your child communicate well with you when you be all together  For this reason  joint session be also call for when it come to work with youth  It be important for family member to learn how to talk to one another about the gender identity issue  and to become more comfortable with the topic  Additionally  parent tend to be good historian and reporter of behavior  which can be extremely beneficial to the treatment course  Sample Questions to Ask a Potential Gender Therapist What be your opinion about how young a child can understand his or her gender identity  What be your general opinion on let a child express his or her own gender identity  What be your thought on hormone blockerstherapy for youth  How long have you work with child  Are you experience in build rapport with child  Have you be train in how to talk to and interview child in a
