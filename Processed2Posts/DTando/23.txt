support a newly transitioning  or newly out  transgender person  Is it a bird  Is it a plane   NO  It \u2019 s  The PRONOUN CORRECTOR    Someone in the early stage of disclose their authentic gender or social transitioning often experience a lot of anxiety about how they be be \u201c read \u201d and if they be be see a their authentic gender  They can experience a lot of fear and anxiety about be read a their assign  birth  gender  When someone be already feeling unsure and a little anxious  it \u2019 s certainly hard to find the courage to correct pronoun and other clarifiers such a \u201c sir \u201d or \u201c ma \u2019 be \u201d  I \u2019 ve coach numerous client and group on how to do this in a friendly  confident fashion  But it remain incredibly difficult for many individual  and I can \u2019 t say I blame them  I be have a conversation with one of my teen client the other day   When I ask how he be do correct pronoun in one of his class a need  he say  \u201c Well  I have a friend in that class  She do the correcting for me \u201d I be happy and relieve for him  I \u2019 m all about empower someone to speak up for themselves  this client and all my other client do plenty of speak up for themselves  When others intervene on their behalf it be a muchneeded break  I say to him  \u201c Oh  you \u2019 ve get a Pronoun Corrector in that class  How awesome  That \u2019 s a special kind of superhero  a Pronoun Corrector \u201d He smile because he know exactly what I mean  I wonder if his friend even understand the power of her intervention  Perhaps one of these day my client will let her know  Pronoun Correctors play a huge role in a friend or love one \u2019 s transition  They model and prompt correct use of pronoun  They can be assertive and strong when the transgender individual be not feel up to the task  Pronoun Correctors show how important it be to use the correct pronoun  and not to let the wrongformer pronoun slip by a if unnoticed or a if they didn \u2019 t matter  Typically  a Pronoun Corrector will have far less anxiety about correct someone than the individual themselves  They be in the perfect position to speak up  I felt this blog post be timely give the holiday be soon upon u  Many transgender people will be see family member and disclose their authentic gender for the first time  Many will be see family member for the time since disclosure  Many will be in a room with some people who be supportive of their gender transition  and some who be not  They will be in room where some people use their birth pronoun and some use their correct  or authentic  pronoun  Sadly  holiday can bring an extra dose of anxiety to someone go through gender transition or try to help others understand who they really be  If you be the loved one of a newly disclose transgender person  win \u2019 t you consider earn your cape  Someone say \u201c he \u201d in reference to a MTF individual  Say \u201c she \u201d  Someone say \u201c her \u201d in reference to an FTM individual  Say \u201c him \u201d  Someone say \u201c he \u201d or \u201c she \u201d in reference to a nonbinary individual  Correct to \u201c they \u201d  or whatever the individual \u2019 s pronoun be  If you be the parent of a newly disclose or transition child  you be in the perfect position to be their superhero  If you be transgender and feel you need a Pronoun Corrector in your life or over the holiday  explicitly ask someone you trust  Send them this blog post and say \u201c Will you be my Superhero  \u201d Havehad a Pronoun Corrector in your life  Let them know what it mean to you  Pronoun Correcting Etiquette  Smile when you correct  Being friendly go a long way  People will tend to follow your lead more when they don \u2019 t sense hostility from you or feel they need to go on the defensive  Say it quietly  but assertively  State it as simply a possible  and nod a if to indicate  \u201c It \u2019 s ok  keep go  just want to be sure you understand the correct pronoun \u201d Be thoughtful about your target audience and recipient of the correction  Correcting pronoun be often most helpful to help someone understand one \u2019 s gender identity  or model for several people who may not be sure about the appropriate pronoun  and who then may appreciate the clarification   Be gentle with loved one  Is it necessary to correct every slip  Absolutely not  If a loved one  particularly a parent  be try  and make a conscious effort to use the correct pronouns  let slip pass by  After a \u201c slip \u201d  you can subtly use a correct pronoun later when you be talk  just a a gentle reminder  If \u201c slip \u201d continue well into the transition  the transgender individual may need to sit down with the loved one to discuss how the loved one \u2019 s \u201c transition \u201d be go in regard to understanding  accept  etc  If a loved one be not ready or have express a strong resistance to use the pronoun that reflect the individual \u2019 s authentic gender  don \u2019 t push it  Give them space and time  Use the correct pronouns yourself  and don \u2019 t comment on their choice of pronoun  Pushing someone before they be ready may close them off to future acceptance and understanding  Check out my first Bitstrip below  Much thanks to my client for give me permission to write about our conversation in this blog
