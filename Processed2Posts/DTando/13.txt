post \u201c What be you go to do about it  \u201d  I discuss two very separate concept  one \u2019 s gender identity and one \u2019 s \u201c decision \u201d about what to do about it  However  I make it clear that \u201c decide \u201d not to transition be not usually a positive choice for a transgender individual  Today let \u2019 s break it down one step far and clarify what this \u201c decision \u201d mean  Deciding to transition often mean act upon something that already be  That be  someone can be transgender in that they feel the brain gender identity they have be different than their assign gender base on their natal sex  Is be transgender a decision  Absolutely not  You can not decide to be transgender  just as much a anyone can not \u201c decide \u201d on their gender before birth  I think talk too much about the \u201c decision \u201d to transition undermines what just simply exist  one \u2019 s brain gender identity  I want to acknowledge that there be some people who be transgender and who choose not to transition  This be a valid choice and one that be completely within their right  Let \u2019 s just say  for argument \u2019 s sake and the sake of this blog post  that transition be the natural response to one be transgender  If that be true  let \u2019 s stop think about transition a a decision and more a an intervention  I suppose this distinction have become more and more clear in my work with transgender youth and how different their process can be  Adults have the tendency to overthink everything  and so sometimes my work involve sit with a client while they agonize over the \u201c decision \u201d to transition  Some of this include not just IF they be go to transition but when  how  etc  It be somewhat different with transgender child  Because of their luxury of not yet have a brain train to overthink thing  they typically know just what they want to do about it  It be their parentsguardians  those in charge of their care  who typically stall the transition  They want their child to be SURE  They want their child to know all aspect of transition prior to \u201c decide to do so \u201d  I have hear this statement so many time  \u201c I just want him to be sure he know what he \u2019 s get into if he decide to transition \u201d or \u201c I just want to be sure she be mature enough to make a decision like this \u201d  and \u201c I tell her if you \u2019 re go to make this decision I just want you to know what the consequence could be \u201d   If you have make a statement like this in my office  please know it be not about you specifically  I have hear these thing too many time to count or to connect to one person or family   Because child don \u2019 t overthink thing  be transgender and transitioning be fluidly  easily connect  Let \u2019 s try not to infringe our overthinking brain upon them  Let \u2019 s start look at transition a an intervention  not a decision  If your child have a medical condition  and a doctor recommend an intervention that could make their life a whole lot well  or potentially save your child \u2019 s life  would you put the decision on the child  Would you present the option to your child but then warn them to consider the financial implication  social implication  family implication on say intervention  Of course not   For a similar concept cover in a different blog post  see \u201c Oxygen \u201d   We be so used to warn our child of possible outcome that we forget some be natural consequence to a circumstance  not something to avoid at all cost  Will there possibly be difficult time ahead for the transgender child who opt to transition  Yes  Will you be there to help them through it  Yes  Given how debilitating and dangerous dysphoria can be  I can assure you any stumble block posttransition will likely be easy to overcome by the distress of not transition at all  Adults read this who identify a transgender  what if you be to think of transition a an intervention instead of a decision  Would you give yourself more permission to act on how you feel and what you know you need  Would you be more willing to assert what you need from others  know this be something that be necessary for you  I want to clarify that for the sake of this blog post I be speak of transition in fairly binary term  that be someone transition from male to female  or female to male  However  plenty of people do not identify within this binary  some be gender fluid  some be genderqueer  some be bigender  some be agender  some be gender nonconforming  For these individual  the \u201c transition \u201d and \u201c intervention \u201d may be somewhat different  It could just include have those around them understand them good  possibly change pronoun  and advocate for the use of proper treatment and pronoun  Those in charge of their caretheir love one should also look at their stated preference a intervention to how they feel  not \u201c decision \u201d they be make to be a certain way genderwise  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
