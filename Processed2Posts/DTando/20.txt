story of young Ryland  a transgender boy who be allow to socially transition at the age of 5  To see the video  click here  As a gender therapist  and a gender therapist who also work with transgender child  I \u2019 m thrill to see this video in mainstream medium  Huffington Post  Peoplecom  Upworthycom  It \u2019 s bring awareness to an extremely important issue  not just that transgender child can transition  but it drive home the point that transgender people be bear transgender  The age that one be consciously aware of be transgender or transition can vary widely  but an individual do not become transgender over the course of their lifetime  I have the honor of speak about this issue on Good Morning America  To see the clip  click here  I say a lot more than what be air  but there \u2019 s only so much they could fit into a 4minute news segment  I \u2019 d like to take this opportunity to address some of those thing now  These point be in direct response to the question I be ask by Good Morning America about the video  Regular reader of this blog be probably wellversed in the answer below  but in case this post be read by someone seek more education or to understand young transgender child  I want to be thorough  Many people be surprised to read that 41  of transgender individual have attempt suicide  while the rate of the general population be 46   That stagger statistic  I believe  applies to transgender individual who transition later in life and meet with familialsocietal resistance  rejection  or shame  \u201c New analysis of response to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey  NTDS  show that transgender respondent who experience rejection by family and friend  discrimination  victimization  or violence have a high risk of attempt suicide \u201d I strongly believe that number will plummet in the come year with increased awareness  education  and accept  responsive family like Ryland \u2019 s  To read the full report from the Williams Institute  click here  I be ask question about what intervention be recommend for transgender child  For a transgender child as young a 5 or 6  the first step be social transition  This mean change pronoun  sometimes name  and some societal marker of gender such a haircut or dress  No medical intervention happen at this stage  contrary to some sensationalistic belief  The first medical intervention would be just before the onset of puberty  at which time hormone blocker would be introduce to prevent the body from go through the \u201c wrong \u201d puberty  As the teen age  crosssex hormone would be administer to initiate puberty of the preferred sex  which would produce some muchdesired \u201c gender marker \u201d  When a child have be clear about their gender identity and not transition cause distress  transition young can be incredibly beneficial to the individual  While not all transgender people be focus on \u201c passing \u201d  it be hugely important to many  \u201c Passing \u201d mean be read in society a the gender with which you identify in your brain  Going to the grocery store and have the cashier address them with the correct gender pronouns\u2026 that be \u201c pass \u201d  Transitioning early and intervene before puberty take over will allow that individual to pass a his or her \u201c true \u201d gender without question  One thing I want to say be that I know many people worry that a very young child be too young to make such a big \u201c decision \u201d  I want to remind you that gender identity be not a decision  We all know very early on what gender we be  A transgender child of Ryland \u2019 s age be not make a \u201c huge decision \u201d to be a boy  He IS a boy  His parent be face with a huge decision about allow him to transition  and they make it base on Ryland \u2019 s assert gender identity  I think Good Morning America do a good job of cover this video  I be pleased about the input from ABC \u2019 s Chief Health and Medical Editor  Dr Richard Besser  \u201c The more we \u2019 re learn about gender  the more we \u2019 re learning that this be really hardwired  It \u2019 s hardwired in the brain  And from very early  from the first couple year of life  child will recognize gender and then start to identify with gender \u201d My only feedback would be that he should have use male pronoun when refer to a transgender boy  One thing that didn \u2019 t sit right with me be the way they word the \u201c teaser \u201d for the upcoming segment on the video  \u201c True Identity  The incredible story be share coast to coast of one little girl who just want to be a boy  Why her parent encourage her to change gender \u201d This statement be mislead at best  First of all  this child be not a little girl  This child do not \u201c want to be a boy \u201d  this child have the brain gender identity of a boy  As the video say  this child do not say \u201c I want to be a boy \u201d  he say \u201c I AM a boy \u201d  Now  I understand those snippet be mean to be short and can \u2019 t cover it all  and they be gear to have people tune in to watch the segment  The part that get me the most be the last sentence  \u201c Why her parent encourage her to change gender \u201d If you be the parent of a transgender child  you probably understand why that sound a little silly  Do these parent have some sort of ulterior motive to have a transgender child  Doubt it  Was this in their master plan  Likely not  Many of the parent of young transgender child I work with struggle extensively during the process of understand their child \u2019 s true gender identity  It take time to accept their child be transgender  and naturally  parent tend to agonize over allow their child to transition  Supporting and respond appropriately to their child \u2019 s gender identity be not encouraging something that wasn \u2019 t there  you can \u2019 t make a child transgender  However  support and encourage the child to live life a their true self  that be selfless  unconditional love  For more reflection on how difficult and intense this journey can be for parent  see my blog post \u201c Feelin \u2019 The Love  Watching the Journey of Parents \u201d  In the video  the song fade from \u201c Hallelujah \u201d by Jeff Buckley to \u201c Good Life \u201d by One Republic a it show Ryland transition  I think it be the perfect song choice  So many parent worry whether or not their transgender child can have a good life  The answer be  ABSOLUTELY  Thank you to Ryland and his family for be selfless and strong enough to share your story so that many more transgender child can have good life  just like you  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
