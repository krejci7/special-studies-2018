physical transition option for the transgender individual  As state in the aforementioned blog  many people ask about surgery the first time they hear about a transgender individual \u2019 s plan to transition  It may surprise many people to find out the transgender individual have no plan to pursue surgery  specifically genital surgery  I recently watch a documentary call \u201c Diagnosing Difference \u201d by Annalise Ophelian  excellent  I highly recommend it    This quote from that documentary summarize perfectly what I be try to say in my last blog  and lead nicely into what I \u2019 m go to explain in this blog  \u201c There \u2019 s this huge stereotype that trans people all have genital surgery  that we know that someone \u2019 s really the new gender because they \u2019 ve have genital surgery  and that \u2019 s one of the big misconception about trans people  In reality  the vast majority of trans people will never have any surgery  and many trans people have surgery that aren \u2019 t genital surgery   Italics add   And some people don \u2019 t have surgery and don \u2019 t undergo medical care relate to their gender because they don \u2019 t want it  it \u2019 s not appropriate to them  there \u2019 s other way that they \u2019 re express their gender  and some people don \u2019 t have it because it \u2019 s not available to them  it \u2019 s not cover by their insurance\u2026and so for both of those reason  rule that govern be you really trans or have you really transition base on genital status or surgical status be very damaging to trans people \u2019 s wellbeing \u201d \u2013Dean Spade Hormone Therapy OK  so before I get to surgery  let me talk a little bit about hormone therapy  or hormone treatment  Hormones be often a huge part of the physical transition process  Femaletomale  FTM  transgender individual take Testosterone or \u201c T \u201d  by patch  cream  or injection  most commonly injection   Doses vary depend on the individual and his desire for physical outcome  Often the first change that occur from take Testosterone be the deepening of the voice and facial hair  These be also two irreversible change that occur from take T Other change include change in facial feature  head shape  clitoral enlargement  and fat redistribution  less on hipsbuttthighs  more to stomach   For more information regard FTM hormone therapy  visit http  transhealthvchcaresourceslibrarytcpdocsconsumerhormonesFTMpdf or http  wwwohioedulgbtresourcestransoptionscfm  MaletoFemale  MTF  individual often take Estrogen  which can be administer orally or by injection  most commonly in a pill form take orally  Hormone therapy for MTF individual also often include an antiandrogen  which block the effect of testosterone  Results from take Estrogen include but be not limit to  breast growth  softening of the skin and facial feature  lessen of body hair  and change in fat distribution  less on abdomen  more to hip and bottom   For

wwwohioedulgbtresourcestransoptionscfm  FemaletoMale Surgical Options FTM individual have the option of two type of surgery  commonly refer to a \u201c top surgery \u201d and \u201c bottom surgery \u201d  Top surgery refers to the removal of breast  the shaping of a male chest  and resizing the nipple  In my experience  this be the most commonly pursued and desire surgery for the FTM individual  A main reason for this be that the removal of breast eliminate the need to bind  http  wwwftmguideorgbindinghtml  and also help the individual \u201c pas \u201d a male  Many  if not most  FTM individual pursue this surgery  and those who don \u2019 t often cite the obstacle of not have the finance for it  Top surgery commonly cost between  610k  out of pocket  For more information re  FTM \u201c top surgery \u201d  please visit  http  wwwftmguideorgchesthtml  As for \u201c bottom surgery \u201d  surgery to construct a penis   most FTM individual do not pursue any genital reconstruction surgery  GRS   You read that right  most DON \u2019 T  Finances be often a major obstacle  GRS cost anywhere from  20k to  70k  depend on the procedure  Additionally  many FTM individual be not happy with the optionsprojected result  technique have not be perfect enough to deliver optimal result  Additionally  some FTM individual don \u2019 t have a problem with their genitalia or see the need to have it change   Remember  one \u2019 s genitalia have more to do with one \u2019 s anatomy than gender  For a refresher on the difference between Gender and Sex  visit my blog Gender Vs  Sex   For those who do pursue \u201c bottom surgery \u201d  there be a few option  These include but be not limit to  a metoidioplasty  which involve cut the ligament connect the  now enlarge  thanks to T  clitoris and remove extra skin  result in a small phallus  The urinary tract can also be lengthen if the individual want to be able to urinate while stand  Another surgery call a \u201c phalloplasty \u201d be basically the creation of a penis use skin from a donor site on the individual \u2019 s body  most commonly the forearm  If the trans man desire testicle  the skin from the labium can be use to create a scrotum  At least six month after a phalloplasty  testicular and penile implant can be insert  To quote Hudson \u2019 s FTM Resource Guide  \u201c Phalloplasty usually involve a urethral lengthening procedure so that the patient can urinate through the penis  Erections be usually achieve with either a malleable rod implant permanently or insert temporarily in the penis  or with an implanted pump device \u201d For more information regard GRS for FTM individual  please visit http  wwwftmguideorggrshtml or http  wwwsavaperoviccomftmsrsmetoidioplastytotalphalloplastyhtm  There be

individual  there be a spectrum of preference about this  MaletoFemale Surgical Options Facial feminization be a common surgery pursue by MTF individual  This can include change the hairline  frontal bone contouring  mandible contouring  chin augmentation or reduction  rhinoplasty  lip augmentation  etc  I don \u2019 t know the exact number on this  but the cost of this surgery can be upwards of  30k  For more information on facial feminization  visit  http  enwikipediaorgwikiFacialfeminizationsurgery  Some trans woman opt to undergo breast augmentation surgery   Estrogen often do not enlarge one \u2019 s breast to more than a \u201c B \u201d cup   http  marcibowerscomgrsbreastaughtml As for MTF \u201c bottom surgery \u201d  often refer to a Sexual Reassignment Surgery  SRS  or Genital Reconstruction Surgery  GRS   many transgender woman opt to undergo a vaginoplasty  use skin and tissue from the penis to create a vagina  clitoris  clitoral hood and labium  This be another expensive surgery not cover by insurance  I don \u2019 t know the exact figure but what I could find imply a ballpark figure of  20k  Sue Boyd  LCSW  a trusted colleague of mine who work with more MTF individual than I do  estimate that about half of her MTF client opt to pursue this surgery \u201c expense and all \u201d  My guess be because the result be more satisfactory to the consumer than the current result of FTM bottom surgery  For more information on MTF GRS  please visit  http  wwwthetransgendercentercomtransgendersurgerymaletofemaleMTFhtml or http  enwikipediaorgwikiSexreassignmentsurgery  maletofemale   Genitalsurgery  I should say again that all of the above depend on personal preference  Some individual believe opt to get any or all of the above surgery be a way of buy into the gender stereotype prescribe by society  particularly about how a man or woman \u201c should \u201d look  To quote the film \u201c Diagnosing Difference \u201d again  \u201c I think \u2018 passing \u2019 be a word to discriminate u immensely  Not everybody can pass  And passing be something that the doctor will tell you to do  you try to pass  Well  no matter how much I pass  I will never be a biological woman  How about empower me a the transgender woman that I be  \u201d Adela Vazquez A moment on my soap box  After read all these extensive option a transgender individual confronts  don \u2019 t you wish thing could be a little bit easy  They can be  By intervene EARLY with a child or preadolescent who have yet to start puberty  their future do not have to hold a many medical intervention  For the MTF individual  star on hormone blocker prepuberty would prevent facial hair from grow in  thereby prevent HOURS of painful and expensive electrolysis  Hormone blocker would also prevent one \u2019 s Adam \u2019 s apple from grow and the voice from deepen  which would eliminate the need for a \u201c trach shave \u201d \u2026 ouch  Similarly  star hormone blocker prepuberty for the FTM individual would prevent breast growth and ultimately prevent an expensive and painful \u201c top surgery \u201d  Additionally  for the transgender individual who desire to \u201c pas \u201d a their true gender  intervene early give them the best chance at do exactly that  For more information about hormone blocker and intervene early
