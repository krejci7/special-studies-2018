transgender identity or plan to transition be \u201c Are you sure   \u201d In fact  this be often a question many of my pretransition client be ask themselves  \u201c Am I sure   \u201d  The question be worth ask  but the answer may not be a simple \u201c yes \u201d or \u201c no \u201d  Most people be pretty darn sure of their gender identity  Cisgender and transgender alike  most be pretty darn sure  What confound thing be that only transgender people have to navigate through have a brain gender identity that differs from their birth sex  and have to first understand and then explain this to others  Still  most be pretty darn sure  Remember  gender identity be different than make the decision to transition  Often time  know one \u2019 s gender identity be the \u201c easy \u201d part  Pursuing a life to align one \u2019 s gender presentation with one \u2019 s brain gender identity  Now that \u2019 s the more challenging part  So  \u201c Are you sure  \u201d  If you be a loved one who find yourself ask this question  try to clarify what you be ask about  Are you ask about your loved one \u2019 s gender identity or plan to transition  If you separate the two  you may find more confidence in the first than the latter  If your loved one be sure of their  trans  gender identity  ask if they be sure about their transition may contribute to fear and anxiety surround this \u201c decision \u201d  Instead  ask \u201c How can I help  What \u2019 s the first step  \u201d  Many client I \u2019 ve meet with who be contemplate transition have say to me  \u201c I want to be 100  sure \u201d  My client tend to be intelligent  highfunctioning individual who be use to do thing well  and they want this to be no exception  They research  they inquire  they ruminate  they agonize  they weigh the risk and benefit ad nauseum  After all this  they be still \u201c not sure \u201d  Why  Because there ARE risk  and because the process isn \u2019 t easy  Therefore  anxiety about this huge undertaking can be interpret a not be \u201c sure \u201d  Again  not so much about the gender identity if I can bring them back to that aspect of themselves instead of just the \u201c decision \u201d to transition  they be much more sure about their gender identity  A good example might be lefthandedness  People be bear lefthanded  no  It use to be lefty be encourage to use their right hand until it become habit  Gender identity be similar in that it be inborn  It can be stifle to present differently  but that doesn \u2019 t mean it \u2019 s good for the person  And what gender one present a be far more pervasive than which hand be dominant  One of my client  a happy and insightful trans man  make mention to not feel completely sure until AFTER he have transition  I later contact him to write a little blurb for this blog post  and he deliver beautifully  Here be what he have to say  \u201c To be honest I wasn \u2019 t 100  sure about transition until I be already pretty far into it  One day about 4 year in I look in the mirror and for the first time in my life I recognize myself  I don \u2019 t think you can ever be 100  sure about anything in life  any decision  any path\u2026it \u2019 s all educate guess wrap up in a hope for happiness \u201d Isn \u2019 t this the case for most thing  We make huge decision all the time that will affect the rest of our life  where to live  where to go to school  the career path to follow  to marry or not to marry  if yes who to marry  to have kid or not have kid  if yes how many  etc  Yet these decision typically aren \u2019 t a agonize over as much or as misunderstood a gender transition  I \u2019 m reluctant to compare gender transition to get married  but the analogy really stick in my mind  How many people be \u201c sure \u201d when they get marry that they will be with the other person \u201c forever \u201d  Of the couple who eventually divorce  if you could ask them \u201c but be you SURE when you get marry  \u201d  most of them would unequivocally say \u201c yes \u201d  Some may argue that gender transition be a more \u201c serious \u201d decision than get married  but be it  Marriages often result in child  who be thereby affect by a divorce if it be to occur  If a capable individual decides to get marry  they get marry  However  if a capable individual decides to go through gender transition  the issue of be \u201c sure \u201d be one they will have to answer over and over again  I guess it \u2019 s because other people can understand marriage  but have a hard time wrap their brain around gender transition  However  this should not matter when it come to others and their decision about their own life  Not to mention the rate of transgender individual later \u201c change their mind \u201d about transition be FAR  FAR less than the current rate of successful vs unsuccessful marriage  I suppose feel more at ease with one \u2019 s decision come down to trust  If your loved one be tell you who they be what they have decide to do  trust them  If you be transgender and have decide to transition  trust yourself  If the person make this decision be of sound judgment and mind  there be no real reason to think this be an irrational decision that will ever be regret  Additionally  if one have come to the decision to transition  it have not come lightly  Many transgender people agonize about the decision to transition long after one \u2019 s true gender identity have become consciously aware  Perhaps be \u201c sure \u201d be an evolutionary process  and one that can only happen after the first step  I do know that trust yourself be a good idea\u2026 of that I be sure  For those of you how have transition  how \u201c sure \u201d do you feel before  After  ", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013
