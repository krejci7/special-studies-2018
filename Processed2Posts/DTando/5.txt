Those of u who know good know that one \u2019 s \u201c true \u201d gender be the one that exist in the brain  This concept may be different for child and adult  Children be concrete thinker  while adult be capable of much more abstract thinking  Genitalia be concrete  the gender identity in one \u2019 s brain be more of an abstract concept  In addition to this  a a part of a child \u2019 s moral development  the importance in \u201c tell the truth \u201d be give much significance  \u201c Lying \u201d or deceive someone be frown upon  and child be often punish for it  As a child get old  there be a development of the understanding of truth  honesty  and conscience  Where do \u201c truth \u201d come from when we be child  For thing that be simple  the truth come from ourselves  For thing that be less simple  or more unknown to u  the truth tend to come from the adult who be in charge of u  When I be at my good friend \u2019 s daughter \u2019 s second birthday party  a bee buzz around the child \u2019 s head while she be eat her cupcake  She exclaim \u201c A bee  \u201d right a it fly away  Her mother  who have not see it  say in a playful way  \u201c Nooooo  that be not a bee  it be a fly  \u201d  The child look at her mom \u2019 s face  pause and think a second  then get a big smile on her face and say  \u201c Yah  A fly  \u201d  She have be right  and her mother wrong   but she didn \u2019 t care  The smile she share with her mom and the contentment that come from their agreedupon reality be all she need  How many child be tell their reality from a very young age  How many child be tell  \u201c you can \u2019 t wear a dress  you \u2019 re a boy  \u201d or \u201c of course you don \u2019 t have a penis  you \u2019 re a girl  \u201d  Often  those \u201c you \u2019 re a boy \u201d and \u201c you \u2019 re a girl \u201d statement be absorb by the young child a TRUTH  Anything other than what their trusted guardian be tell them must be a lie  or something to be keep to themselves  Only the minority of transgender child will be insistent and assert their truth over the protest of their parent  s   This moral development and ability to grasp abstract concept can influence a child \u2019 s ability to understand their own gender identity  assert their true gender  desire to transition  andor their desire to be read in large society a their desired gender  Have I lose you  Let me be clear  An enlightened  insightful transgender adult may begin the process of transition and be see for the gender identity that match what be in their brain  For example  a FemaletoMale transgender individual start the transition process and be very pleased when a stranger in the grocery store address him a \u201c Sir \u201d  Does he feel deceitful and a though he be not tell the truth  Not likely  For him  he understand his \u201c true \u201d gender identity be male and it be ok to be see a male and assert himself a male  This be a bit trickier for a child  particularly a latencyage child who be learn the concept of \u201c right and wrong \u201d  honesty  and the concept of guilt  I have hear many parent say \u201c she get MAD when people think she \u2019 s a boy  You \u2019 d think she \u2019 d be happy \u201d   On the other hand  there be kid who be thrill when they be perceive a their preferred gender and would never tell the stranger otherwise  As I always say  everyone be different     Often time  if the child get mad  parent look to this a a possible clue that their child may not be transgender  I tend to think it have to do more with concrete thinking and the desire to be \u201c honest \u201d  One way to help child understand it \u2019 s ok to be true to themselves be to explain the difference between anatomical sex and brain gender identity  as well a the fact that their brain gender identity be who they \u201c truly \u201d be  This give them the green light to relax and know that when they assert their preferred gender  they be in fact  tell the truth  Some of my transgender kid  after they transition  be tell by peer  \u201c but you \u2019 re really a girl \u201d or \u201c you \u2019 re really a boy \u201d  These peer aren \u2019 t necessarily be mean  they be simply assert what they know concretely  body  and enforce what they think be the TRUTH  Part of my work with my young client be then to help them understand that who they \u201c really \u201d be be who they be in their \u201c brain \u201d and their \u201c heart \u201d  and give them language to help their peer understand as well  Of course to help everyone  kid and adult alike    the focus have to be on a societal shift of understand what someone \u2019 s gender really be  If gender continue to be define by body  then confusion  misunderstanding and stigma will continue  How comfortable be you in your own \u201c truth \u201d  Did it take you a while to fully understand who you be on the inside be who you \u201c really \u201d be  Was there anything that help you come around to this understanding  ", "feedtitle": "Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
