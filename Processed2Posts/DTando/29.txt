crosssex hormone   For those of you who don \u2019 t know  this would include a Male to Female preteenteen take Estrogen  and a Female to Male preteenteen take Testosterone  in order for them to go through puberty in line with their brain gender identity  Read more about it here   I know this be a controversial topic  and there be a many opinion about this a there be professional  if not people  Of course  the first step in treat a transgender child about to enter puberty be usually hormone blocker  While incredibly expensive  I think most parent and doctor be more willing to allow the childpreteen to go on these because a  it buy them time  b  it prevent physical change from happen during puberty that have to be \u201c undone \u201d later  and c  the change be reversible  Remove the hormone blocker  and the individual go through the puberty of their natal sex  Not so with crosssex hormone  Many change be irreversible  and can have lifelong impact on one \u2019 s reproductive system  I understand the anxiety parent and doctor feel about transgender preteens start hormone  I \u2019 m still a proponent of it  on a case by case basis  I recently learn that the Endocrine Society guideline recommend that endocrinologists wait to put preteensteens on crosssex hormone until the age of 16  In my opinion  this be too late  Most of their peer will be go through or will have go through puberty by that age  One argument I \u2019 ve hear about this be that there be \u201c late bloomer \u201d  Sure  there be \u201c late bloomer \u201d  but these teen need not be  Being late to enter puberty mean something entirely different to a nontransgender teen and a transgender teen  The former may be anxiously await puberty  The latter may be close to suicide  For those youth who do receive hormone blocker  this be a lifechanger  their body be not go to go through the \u201c wrong \u201d puberty  However  even these preteens and teen struggle with gain those important \u201c gender marker \u201d in order to help them pass in society  a deep voice and facial hair for male teenager  a more curvaceous figure for female teenager  Without the needed physical help from hormone  pass can be very difficult  And be read a the wrong gender every day be an agony no teen should have to go through  In my opinion  treatment before the age of 16 be medically necessary to support the mental health of transgender youth  I suppose if more people sit across from transgender preteens and teenager the way I do  more people would agree  I see a sadness and a desperation in their eye I simply do not think have to be a part of this process  I don \u2019 t have all the answer  I don \u2019 t have a medical degree that would help me understand exactly the process of crosssex hormone in an adolescent \u2019 s body  I \u2019 m come from a therapist \u2019 s standpoint who understand how crucial it be for teen to feel a though they fit in with their peer as well a the need to be see for who they really are and the depression and suicidality that result when they don \u2019 t  In the word of Karen  the mother of an FTM individual and author of the blog Transforming Family  \u201c When a child be as sure a my son be  I think it be senseless and really torturous to make them wait until they reach some arbitrary age guideline  I realize this be anecdotal  but every trans teen I \u2019 ve know of who have be suicidal  depressed  or have selfharmed have be in that age range where they can not get crossgender hormone andor surgery and be miserable due to dysphoria  \u2026  the negative symptom lift after medical transition  so why prolong their suffering unnecessarily  \u201d  Monica Nu\u00f1ezCham lead the family support group for family with gender nonconforming and transgender child in San Diego  She be also the mother of Isaac  now 18   an FTM individual who start medical transition  crosssex hormone soon follow by surgery  at the age of 13  \u201c He want so badly to appear male and experience the same change his friend be have  low voice  facial hair  etc   He be very uncomfortable in his body and hat every feminine form  hip  butt  chest   I know that the physical change of T would help others who know him a a \u201c girl \u201d to perceive him a male  The risk  that nobody could explain with certainty to me because there be not much research  be much low than the 100  reality of see my dear child in emotional pain every day and withdraw himself from life   \u2026  I always try to listen to my heart and do what I think be the best for him  with the tool I have at the time  Hormones and surgery be the best decision we could have make  Isaac a a little boy be a happy one  always sing  talk  make friend and very easily express his feeling by kiss  hug and verbally  Close to puberty he stop be happy  to the point of not allow me to touch him  After the T  he come back  not little by little  suddenly he be the same happy kid  After the surgery I be very surprised to see him just BLOSSOM in a spectacular manner  I attribute his success a a person  academically  socially  emotionally  to the fact that we act as soon a we know how \u201d The Harry Benjamin  now WPATH  Standards of Care be revise 7 time  In my opinion  the first version be hopelessly damage to transgender individual seek treatment  By the 7th version  it be finally come around to the way it should be  professional support and make life easy for transgender individual  not hard  Additionally  the Standards of Care be only create to be general guideline to give those who be inexperienced some semblance of a plan  They be not law that govern how a professional chooses to treat a transgender individual  Such be the same a the guideline for the Endocrine Society  in fact it say so in their disclaimer statement  \u201c Clinical Practice Guidelines be develop to be of assistance to endocrinologist by provide guidance and recommendation for particular area of practice  The Guidelines should not be consider inclusive of all proper approach or method  or exclusive of others  The Guidelines can not guarantee any specific outcome  nor do they establish a standard of care  The Guidelines be not intend to dictate the treatment of a particular patient  Treatment decision must be make base on the independent judgment of health care provider and each patient \u2019 s individual circumstances \u201d Wondering what the late version of the Standards of Care say  in part  regard prescribe hormone to transgender adolescent  \u201c Refusing timely medical intervention for adolescent might prolong gender dysphoria and contribute to an appearance that could provoke abuse and stigmatization  As the level of genderrelated abuse be strongly associate with the degree of psychiatric distress during adolescence  Nuttbrock et al  2010   withhold puberty suppression and subsequent feminizing or masculinize hormone therapy be not a neutral option for adolescents \u201d I know of two gender clinic in all of Southern California who medically treat transgender youth   These clinic  a you can imagine  have long wait time due to the high demand and sheer number of patient in need  I \u2019 ve say it before  and I \u2019 ll say it again  I see my role a help individual live their life a the gender they be in their brain  Most of the time this be not about help them figure out their gender identity  but figure out what they be go to do about it  For those childrenpreteensteens who know who they be  and what they want to do  let \u2019 s help them do it  Most people will doubt your judgment because of your age  It may take a lot more talk to convince the \u2018 adult \u2019 that you really know who you be  Chris  19  From the Advocates for Youth pamphlet  \u201c I Think I Might Be Transgender  Now What Do I Do  \u201d   If anyone reading this have more information on endocrinologist who treat transgender youth in California  please private message me or include in the comment  ", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
