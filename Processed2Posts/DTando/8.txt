transgender status  I encourage my client to think about it in term of PRIVATE or SECRET  Some people be more private in general than others  Some people will tell others pretty much everything about their life  while others try to keep most thing private  Both be ok  as long a the individual be the one do the decide about what to keep private and what to share  Just a most thing land on a spectrum  so do one \u2019 s feeling about exactly how private be transgender be  Some be \u201c out and proud \u201d  be the first in line to wave the transgender flag in the Trans Pride parade  Others  on the other end of the spectrum  guard it like a deep  dark secret  one they feel could devastate them if others be to find out  In my opinion  one can land on this spectrum base on temperament  upbringing  personal background  etc  I will say that those on the \u201c secret \u201d end of the spectrum seem to experience more intense dysphoria and internal distress than those who have a healthy relationship with be transgender  Sometimes it do seem to be in the client \u2019 s best interest to shift from \u201c secret \u201d to \u201c private \u201d  This entry be originally write a a Social Skills Group topic  so the wording may seem relatively elementary  It be for that reason that this can be share with both kid and adult  If you have a child who be either very private about their transgender experience or be contemplate who to tell  this would be good to read together and process  For the purpose of this post  here be what I mean by \u201c private \u201d and \u201c secret \u201d  PRIVATE  Something about you not everyone need to or should know  SECRET  Something you don \u2019 t want anyone to know  Secrets can be fun  like you what you be go to give someone for Christmas  Or  if someone be throw someone a surprise party  they will want you to keep that a SECRET from the recipient  Secrets like these be important because they be about do something nice for someone else  Other secret be not healthy  such a an adult ask a child to keep a secret from their parent  Other secret be not good or bad  but might be important to others  For example  if your friend tell you who they have a crush on  they might ask you to keep it a \u201c secret \u201d  Of course  what you look like under your clothes be private  Only a child \u2019 s parent  guardian  or doctor should see their body for the purpose of keep them healthy and take care of  For old individual  they can choose with whom to share their body in a more intimate setting  An important qualification I want you to keep in mind be that personal information about you should be consider PRIVATE  and not necessarily SECRET  I believe this result in less stress  more selfacceptance  less anxiety  and more confidence  Mainly this have to do with how you guard the information in your head and in your heart  If you feel like there be some thing about you which you would rather not have everyone know  or would choose only a few people to know  that \u2019 s okay  If you have a secret that you feel like \u201c I would just DIE if anyone know  \u201d  that can affect your mental health negatively  If you feel you have a secret like this  it \u2019 s time to do some selfexploration  Do you feel this way about be transgender  If yes  why  Do you consider it a bad thing  If yes  begin work on have a more positive relationship with yourself and your history  Talk to a therapist  parent  or trust friend about it  Try to figure out why this feel so secretive to you and how you may be able to evolve into consider it private information instead  The truth be  no matter what information you have about yourself  it win \u2019 t ACTUALLY be the end of the world if others find out  You might feel expose for a little bit  but you would be ok  If you feel like the \u201c secret \u201d get out would be the end of the world  you might be spend more time feel more worried or unhappy than you need to  Feeling like it be \u201c private \u201d instead may help you feel good about it in general and less worried about others find out  Here \u2019 s a visual for you  think of personal  private  information a be keep behind a fence with a gate  There be a boundary around the information  and not everyone can get in  YOU get to decide for whom to open the gate  or who get to know your information  Remember that everyone you tell your private information to now have a key to the gate  and can let others in without your permission  This be why you want to stop and think before you share private information  Also  you can remind yourself that if others you have not intend to know find out  \u201c It \u2019 s ok  I can handle this \u201d  Think of have a secret a guard it like a castle with a tall wall  drawbridge  and moat with alligator around it  You be guard it very aggressively  make SURE no one find out  The problem be  have such wall around you and guard your secret can eventually make you feel very alone  This be why have a fence with a gate  private information  be good than have secret  castle with many guard factor   If someone ask you a question about your personal information  STOP AND THINK if you would like this person to know your personal information  If yes  share with them and then ask them to keep it private  Remember  you have no control over whether or not they actually will keep it private  If you do not feel comfortable sharing  or don \u2019 t want to risk others share this information  you can say something like this  \u201c That \u2019 s personal \u201d \u201c I don \u2019 t want to talk about that \u201d \u201c I \u2019 d rather not say \u201d \u201c That \u2019 s private \u201d  You don \u2019 t need to apologize about not share  it \u2019 s your gate  you get to decide for whom to open it  If you be transgender  where do you land on the \u201c private vs secret \u201d spectrum  Do you have some shift you can do  If you be share this blog with a child  please feel free to complete the attached exercise with them   Some adult may find it useful  too    Ask them to write down in the column next to the list information whether the information be \u201c private \u201d  \u201c secret \u201d  or \u201c open \u201d  PrivateSecretOpen Worksheet ", "feedtitle": "Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
