genitalia  If you have be one of those people ask such a question  don \u2019 t feel bad  It \u2019 s normal to be curious about this  and it \u2019 s something concrete I think people tend to ask about a a way of understand the transition process  However  I \u2019 d like to take this opportunity to explain why question about a transgender person \u2019 s genitalia might be a little off the mark  When you ask about anatomyprivate partsgenitalia  you be refer to one \u2019 s sex  not gender  When a person reveal their gender identity to you and it be different than how you have always think  they be explain how they would like to be see by friend  family  and society at large  They be talk about which pronouns they would like you to use  \u201c hehimhis \u201d  \u201c theythemtheirs \u201d \u201c sheherhers \u201d  etc    which name they would like you to use  and whether they would like to be see a a man  woman  both  or neither  If you think about it  our genitalia do very little for u in explain our gender identification  Simply put  no one see these part of u except perhaps medical professional or those with whom we plan to be sexually intimate  If the one of first question you ask be about one \u2019 s genitalia  I would say you \u2019 re concern with the \u201c wrong end \u201d  Bring your attention up\u2026 way up  One \u2019 s gender identity exist in one \u2019 s brain  If you really want to know about how a transgender person feel  identifies  or want to be see  ask about what go on for them in their brain  If someone say they be \u201c transsexual \u201d  this translate to \u201c change sex \u201d  So the more outdated \u201c sex change operation \u201d applies here   Now call Sexual Reassignment Surgery   However  your love one will probably not refer to themselves a transsexual  You will likely hear the term \u201c transgender \u201d which yes  mean \u201c change gender \u201d  Stay with them in this revelation and focus on their gender  not their sex   For a more detailed explanation of these two concept  please check out my Gender Vs  Sex blog   They \u2019 re call private part for a reason  A complaint I often hear from transgender individual be that as soon a they reveal their plan to transition  others feel they have the right to know about what \u2019 s in their pant  or what \u2019 s go to be in their pant post transition  A good rule of thumb  if you wouldn \u2019 t normally ask this person about their genitalia  don \u2019 t do it after they \u2019 ve come out a transgender to you  If the transgender individual be a VERY close friend or family member  and you think it \u2019 s ok to ask  ask eventually  Don \u2019 t have it be one of your initial question  Show you understand their gender FIRST  Do research on what option be out there for transgender individual and then lovingly ask your loved one what they be consider  Be different  Because many transgender people have tell me this be one of the first question they get  it will be refresh for them to come across someone who doesn \u2019 t ask about their anatomy  Ask about what you can expect with their upcoming change and how you can support them during this major transition  More importantly  ask them how they be do with such an important change  Because change gender be largely about how someone be see and perceive  transgender individual be often most interested in those change that will help them \u201c pas \u201d a the gender which match their brain gender identity  One \u2019 s genitalia be not proudly display while one be shop at the grocery store  Therefore  genitalia be not one of the first consideration of a transgender individual when focus their effort on try to pass  The main thing that help individual pass for a particular gender include but be not limit to  hair length andor style  presence or absence of facial hair  pitch of voice  clothing  and presence or absence of breast  When someone be try to assess another \u2019 s gender  these factor be usually use the most when try to make a decision  Hormone supplement  Testosterone or Estrogen  can assist with many of these change  Shay O \u2019 Reilly explain it well in the article \u201c Shunning Medical Hoops  Transgender Patients Turn to \u2018 Informed Consent \u2019 Model \u201d  \u201c While much medium attention be pay to gender confirmation surgery  it \u2019 s hormone replacement therapy that often make the large difference in the life of transpeople  Patients frequently report that hormone therapy make their body feel more comfortable or more like home\u2014more importantly to many  hormone masculinize or feminize the body  help trans people be read correctly a their gender \u201d Referencing one \u2019 s genitalia immediately follow a revelation about their gender can enforce stereotype and insecurity  When the question and conversation go immediately to one \u2019 s genitalia  you be reinforce the misconception that one \u2019 s gender be base on and entirely connect to one \u2019 s anatomy  When one immediately \u201c go there \u201d  the interpretation may be something like this  \u201c You say you want to be a man  well  men have penis \u201d or \u201c So if you say you \u2019 re a woman  you \u2019 re go to have a vagina  right  \u201d  If the transperson can not afford or do not wish to pursue \u201c bottom surgery \u201d  the implication could then be that they will not \u201c really \u201d be the gender they be say they identify a  Additionally  it be likely the trans person be acutely aware of how their anatomy  sex  do not match up with the gender identity of their brain  Calling attention to this and ask them to explain it  often over and over to many different people  can be exhaust  Not only because it \u2019 s private and could make the transperson uncomfortable  but because it may bring up feeling of inadequacy  sadness  or wish their anatomy be different  For the transperson read this blog who do not like discuss this with others  here be a few tip to deal with \u201c the \u201d dread question  Have a response ready  or an arsenal of response ready  Be a broken record if you need to  Examples  \u201c I \u2019 m not comfortable answer that \u201d  \u201c That \u2019 s a little too personal \u201d  \u201c I don \u2019 t feel comfortable tell you about me specifically  but I can tell you that some transgender people choose to \u2026 and some choose to\u2026 \u201d  \u201c That \u2019 s private \u201d  If the question bring up feeling of frustration or exasperation  take a deep breath  Give yourself space for a response  As I say before  I don \u2019 t believe others be try to be invasive or inappropriate  they be merely curious and try to understand  Redirect the person to a more appropriate mean of get their curiosity satisfy  \u201c I appreciate your interest  Let me suggest some websites\u2026 books\u2026 blog  etc \u201d A great way to redirect a question like this be to briefly clarify the difference between gender and sex  You could say  \u201c Actually  that question be more about my sex  and I \u2019 m try to tell you about my gender \u201d Use humor  Laughing it off will make the other person more comfortable  and it will probably be good for you  too  Kim Pearson  cofounder of Trans Youth Family Allies and mother of a Female to Male transgender individual  use a great response when fielding question about her son  When ask if he \u2019 s have \u201c the \u201d surgery  she state  \u201c No  he still have his appendix \u201d  When the person then clarify they be refer to genital surgery  she ask them to please go first and describe their child \u2019 s genitals in detail  Stay tune for my next blog which will include description of bottom surgery and other option for transgender individual  My hope be that this will help satisfy some curiosity so the question don \u2019 t need to be ask a often  and for transpeople to use a a resource to give those who be curious  ", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
