to think much about your lung  You be bear with fully function lung that have deliver oxygen to your blood and brain  just a they be suppose to  You can \u2019 t imagine it any other way  simply because it \u2019 s never be any other way for you  You \u2019 ve also not give much think to the role oxygen play in your life  because it \u2019 s always be there  as much a you need  deliver to you on cue  no question ask  For anyone who \u2019 s briefly experience a decrease in oxygen  or lack of oxygen  that person will likely never forget the feeling of panic and the intense  primal need to have oxygen fill the lung once again  Take a nice  deep breath  Let the air expand your lung and your stomach  Feels good  doesn \u2019 t it  Ah  oxygen  What would you do without it  Well  you \u2019 d die  be the obvious answer  What if you have enough of it to survive  but just not quite enough to lead a \u201c normal \u201d life  Picture this  You be bear with something wrong with your lung  so that they couldn \u2019 t fully absorb and process oxygen the way most people \u2019 s lung can  You can take in just enough oxygen to live  but not fully engage in life  Since you be bear with your lung not do precisely what they should do  you spend every day of your life not be able to do all the thing you would otherwise like to do  You spend many of your day wish your lung be different  wish you could breathe a fully and deeply a everyone around you  You watch everyone take those deep  lifesustaining breath  and you can tell none of them realize how lucky they be  their lung  and the result oxygen they get  be simply take for grant  You stand there  take shallow  rag breath  feel weak and somewhat listless  Then one day  you stumble across something on the internet  \u2018 Subpar Oxygenation Syndrome \u201d   Yes  I make that up   You discover there be a name for what you \u2019 ve be experience  and other people have it too  Sadly  some have take their own life from not be able to tolerate the feeling associate with have this syndrome  You feel relieve  validate  excite  Then you read that there be a solution  While it may not give you new lung  there be a machine that can deliver this lifeenhancing oxygen straight to you  an oxygen tank  It \u2019 s expensive  insurance doesn \u2019 t cover it in this scenario   but you know you \u2019 ll do anything to get access to it  The day you get your tank feel like the most liberating  exciting day of your life  You strap that baby on  it come in a nifty backpack  and put the tube under your nose  To breathe so fully and so easily be something you \u2019 ve long for your whole life  but never think you \u2019 d experience   At time  you feel sad and resentful you have to wear such a contraption to feel the way most others be bear feeling  but continue to be grateful nonetheless   When you explain to those close to you what you \u2019 ve discover and show them your new tank  they \u2019 re skeptical  \u201c Really  Are you sure you \u2019 re not get enough oxygen  I get plenty of oxygen every time I take a deep breath  Perhaps you \u2019 re not do it right \u201d Others don \u2019 t like your oxygen tank  \u201c Hmmm  I like you good before you wear that tank  I \u2019 m not use to see you with those tube  Can you please take it off  \u201d  You \u2019 re sadden and shake by these response  but you don \u2019 t take it off  The oxygen tank bring you too much relief and too much life to dare take it off  \u00a7 I \u2019 ve be look for some sort of concrete metaphor to use to help explain be transgender and transition  Concrete example can help with understanding  However  I want to be careful not to compare be transgender with be disable  I do not think it be a disability  I think it be something REAL  like not get enough air  I hope this analogy do justice to those transgender individual read it and hit home with loved one  The irony of my example be that if someone have be bear with something wrong with his or her lung  it would likely have be catch right away by medical doctor  and offer a solution early on  Gender variance be a bit trickier  a person \u2019 s need for his or her gender identity to be validate develops much late than one \u2019 s need for adequate oxygen  While we still have a long way to go  intervene with child who display persistent gendervariant behavior and a consistent desire for change gender be much like offer the oxygen tank to the person in the above scenario a a child  \u201c I know what you need  here you go \u201d One last think worth mentioning be that I do believe be transgender be a medical condition and belongs in the medical book  not the DSM  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders   This be why compare it to another type of medical condition be appeal to me  I \u2019 ll save the rest of my thought on this topic for another blog  To Oxygen  ", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando,
