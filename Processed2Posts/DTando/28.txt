Managed Health Care  DMHC  have order California \u2019 s health plan to remove exclusion of coverage base on gender identity and expression  Kaiser be the first I \u2019 ve see to release more information about what they be specifically do in response to these change  I couldn \u2019 t get my hand on an official document or website that outline these change  but I have be speak with a couple of Kaiser representative who have be answer my question about the late development re  Kaiser and surgeriestreatments for transgender individual  Part of this come from an internal Kaiser

benefit include sexual reassignment surgery and mastectomychest reconstruction service  in addition to behavioral health and hormone therapy service  hysterectomiesoophorectomies be include a covered procedure in \u201c bottom surgery \u201d for FTM individual  If a hysterectomy be medically necessary for other reason  surgery be cover no question ask  If this surgery be pursue a it relate to gender transition  the surgery have to be review by the \u201c transgender surgical review board process \u201d  MTF breast augmentation be not a covered benefit Cost sharing for these service be the same a cost sharing for other medical service for the employer group or individual \u2019 s plan  eg  inpatient hospital cost share  office visit cost share  etc   The benefit have no lifetime dollar cap on service  even for employer group that previously purchase KP \u2019 s optional transgender surgery rider that include a lifetime dollar cap  What other KP line of business include transgender benefit  MediCal KPIC insured plan  base on regulation issue by the CA Dept of Insurance  KPIC be currently determine the scope of transgender benefit require under the regulation  Benefits in these

make in those region yet in term of immediate action step or change to practice  Other state may take similar or different action in the future  Southern California Contact  TransgenderCare  kporg Northern California Contact  Terri Hupfer TerriHupfer  kporg wwwkporgeastbaytransgender Not sure what your insurance company be do about this  Call them  Ask them how their policy have change and what procedure be now cover  Please  let me know what you find out at tandotherapy  mecom  Update 8113  Matt Wood of the Transgender Law Center offer further explanation and clarification  Kaiser be an insurer  and a such it offer a variety of plan  It \u2019 s important to help people understand the difference between a plan and an insurer  In the past  certain plan include care for SRS  and certain one didn \u2019 t  So people use to call me and ask if they should insure themselves with Kaiser or Blue Cross  because they hear Kaiser offer trans care  The truth of the matter be that all insurer offer all care \u2013 it just depend upon what plan you or your employer contract for  We have argue all along the while exclusions themselves weren \u2019 t unlawful  those base upon gender identity be  The problem be that Kaiser and other insurer have exclusion that be word a if they solely apply to trans people  \u201c no care relate to transsexualism \u201d  a oppose to exclusion base upon procedure  \u201c no hysterectomy \u201d   As a result  the DMHC issue it letter say that all medical care that be medically necessary for gender transition and that be available to nontrans people can not be exclude  There \u2019 s no distinction between MTF and FTM care  or bottom and top surgery  All could be cover  depend upon a person \u2019 s unique medical circumstance  But we \u2019 re hear right now that they don \u2019 t want to do any trans related surgery for people with plan that formerly have exclusion until they have receive more information from DMHC  We \u2019 re not sure why this be  We expect to get more clarification within 6 month  but that be a huge burden for many people with HMOs  not just Kaiser  Medical be different  Medical be a federal program administer by state at the county level  MediCal have never exclude transitionrelated care  top  bottom surgery or HRT   However  depend upon which provider the county contract with  that provider might have be misinform and tell a person there be an exclusion  Some people have MediCal through HMOs  Some have it through fee for service  find their own doctor who accept and get reimburse   The affordable care act will make it more likely that people will have HMOs  Some county contract with Kaiser  esp here in the Bay Area   But other county don \u2019 t  But Exclusions don \u2019 t now  and haven \u2019 t in the past  be a legal barrier to care  Barriers have be ignorance of provider and lack of available provider  those that accept medical reimbursement rate  which be supposedly among the low in the nation   The Director \u2019 s letter applies to all HMOs  not just to Kaiser  as well a to all plan \u2013 include those offer by employer and school  as well a those purchase by individual  The only exception be that it do not apply to HMO plan that be offer by company that be to \u201c selfinsured \u201d Many large company be self insured  so check your plan carefully  If your company be selfinsured and offer an HMO plan  it be not subject to the Director \u2019 s letter  What this mean  1  An HMO can not deny to a transgender patient the same medical procedure it cover for a nontransgender person  So if an HMO will cover a nontrans person \u2019 s hormone therapy for some medical reason  it must cover hormone therapy relate to gender transition for trans people  Similarly  if an HMO offer genital surgery to a nontrans person for some reason  it can not deny it to a transgender person who seek it a part of their treatment for gender dysphoriaGID  2  HMOs be not require to cover all type of transitionrelated care  Rather  they be require treat trans and nontrans people the same in the provision of cover care  So  for example  if an HMO do not provide coverage for a hysterectomy for a nontrans woman  then it do not have to provide coverage for a hysterectomy for a transman base upon his gender transition  3  HMOs offer \u201c manage care \u201d and a primary way they save cost be by contract with specific physician and surgeon  These medical professional then become part of the HMO \u2019 s \u201c network \u201d As a result  if the HMO already have someone in network who can perform top surgery or GRS  then you must use that innetwork provider  If you want to go to a specific surgeon that you choose  ask them first if they be part of the HMO \u2019 s network  If they be not and you still want to go to them  you \u2019 ll have to pay for the procedure outofpocket  In some rare case  a deem appropriate by the HMO and base upon a person \u2019 s unique medical circumstance  the HMO may choose to cover medical care by a provider who be not in it network  4  Finally  there be still much confusion about what the Director \u2019 s letter mean  and we be aware of transpeople who be still be deny cover care by HMOs  If this happen to you  please contact the Transgender Law Center at 4158650176 x306 or online at  http
