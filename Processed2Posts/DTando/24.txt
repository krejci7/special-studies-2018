be a very good day in my book  AB  1266  otherwise name the \u201c School Success and Opportunity Act \u201d  require that California public school respect student \u2019 gender identity and ensure that student can fully participate in all school activity  sport team  program  and facility that match their gender identity  The issue affect by this bill be not just concept to me  but thing I think about and talk about on a very regular basis  More importantly  I see and hear about the impact this issue have on many different kid and teens all the time  In my practice  I have hear about a student be tell they may not participate in everyday activity at school like change for PE with the rest of their peer  make them clearly stand out  I have see kid who feel reject and ostracize at school because they be force to use the nurse \u2019 s bathroom and may not use the bathroom with their peer  I have have my teen client tell me they dehydrate themselves and \u201c hold it \u201d all day to avoid have to use the bathroom at all  I have have teen client have to mask their true gender identity in order to be allow to continue to play a sport they love and at which they excel  Therefore  you can only imagine my elation when I hear about the bill that will protect student like this  However  not long after the celebration of this victory come the opposition  People speak up who adamantly oppose the existence of this bill  I  again  find myself surprise at the ignorance and discrimination I hear and read  Many opponent of this bill have inaccurately name it \u201c The Bathroom Bill \u201d because they seem to ignore the other aspect of equality that be be offer by the bill go into law and focus solely on what it mean for transgender student be allow to use the appropriate bathroom  Therefore  I will focus on that part of the bill in this blog post  for now  So what be we talk about here  We be talk about girl be able to use the girl \u2019 restroom  and boys be able to use the boy \u2019 restroom  It explicitly state a student may use the facility consistent with his or her gender identity  irrespective of the gender list on the pupil \u2019 s record  It do not say \u201c all student \u201d can pick which bathroom they want to go in  depend on their mood  We be NOT talk about boy use the girl \u2019 bathroom and girl use the boy \u2019 bathroom  We \u2019 re just not  If someone say we be  he or she do not understand what make someone a boy or a girl  Having a penis or a vagina do not make someone a boy or a girl  Being a boy or a girl reference one \u2019 s gender identity  which exist in one \u2019 s brain  Talking about genitals only reference one \u2019 s natal sex   For more information on this  reread my post \u201c Gender Vs  Sex \u201d   For those people who insist have a penis or a vagina be what determine whether someone be a boy or a girl  why   WHY must genitals trump brain  I don \u2019 t understand  What be this focus on genitals  Why do some people act a though what someone have in their pant be more important than what they have in their head   I mean  you could function and lead a productive life without a penis or a vagina  provide there be modification make for the elimination of urine   but you can \u2019 t function or lead a productive life without a brain  Brains trump genitals  a they should in the gender debate and many other issue I win \u2019 t mention here  Speaking of be hyperfocused on genitals  people seem to be confuse about how transgender people use their genitals in the bathroom  Some seem to think it will be a transgender person \u2019 s goal to show off their genitals in the bathroom  I recently read a quote in the LA Times  \u201c What if a kid with a penis be stand at the boy \u2019 urinal wear a dress and a pretty hair bow  \u201d This be not quite how it \u2019 s go to go down  folk  First of all  if this quote reference a transgirl and be allow to use the restroom that match her gender identity  she would be in the girl \u2019 restroom  There be no urinal in the girl \u2019 restroom  Additionally  transgender child and adult be typically go to be incredibly careful to stay cover when use the restroom  You \u2019 d probably have a great chance of be strike by lightning than see a transperson \u2019 s genitalia in a public or school restroom  Others seem convince a transgender person be go to be interested in look at other people \u2019 s genitals in the bathroom  That whole \u201c man in a dress in the woman \u2019 s restroom \u201d argument  Only serve to prove the ignorance of the opponent  A transgender woman be not a man in a dress  she be a woman  She likely have the same interest in see the genitals of the other woman in the restroom a the general population   How high do you think that be  Pretty low  I would imagine  I \u2019 ve not see a lot of girlswomen try to catch glimpse over the bathroom stall in all my year of use school and public restroom  but I digress   Want to know how I think a transgender child  teen  or adult us their genitals in the bathroom  To eliminate urine  Surprise  Oh  and thanks to social stigmatization and ignorance  that same individual will probably do their business and then hurry out of the restroom as fast a possible  Not what I want for the people I care about  Lastly  I \u2019 ve heard and read concern that a male child or teen may \u201c pretend \u201d to be transgender just to get to use the girl \u2019 restroom   The fact that no one be worry that a \u201c girl \u201d be go to \u201c pretend \u201d to be a boy just to get a peek in the boy \u2019 bathroom say other negative thing about society at large   Let me tell you  I just don \u2019 t see that happen  Bear in mind this be not about \u201c I feel like a girl today \u201d or \u201c I feel like a boy today \u201d  This be about a consistent  persistent crossgender identification that will likely be discuss and explore at length by parent and professional prior to a child transitioning and therefore use a bathroom different than that in line with their natal sex  To the opponent  please  sit down  Be quiet  You know not what you do  You be protect child who do not need protect and harm child who do  As a professional who have care for and work with many transgender kidsteensfamiliesadults  I know more about this issue than you do  I understand what it mean to be transgender more than you do  I understand the bathroom behavior of transgender individual well than you do  I care about this issue more than you do  and I \u2019 m on the other side  This be about be treat like a decent  normal student along with one \u2019 s peer  This be about be able to play on the team in line with one \u2019 s gender identity and be include with samegender peer for activity such a PE  This be about not force a GIRL to play on a boys \u2019 team or not force a BOY to be in a girl \u2019 group for PE  Even if this bill \u201c stick \u201d  and I hope it do  everyone be not yet safe  Transgender individual be \u201c allow \u201d to use the restroom that match their brain gender identity be not enough  The understanding of gender identity need to be increase in the general population  Please  if you care about this issue  speak up  Urge those around you to avoid sign petition in opposition to this bill  Educate others who may misunderstand what this bill be all about  Consider sign this pledge to support transgender youth  http  wwwchangeorgpetitionsisupporttransgenderstudents For more indepth
