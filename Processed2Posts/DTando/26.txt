the fact that this teen have \u201c less than a year of Real Life Experience \u201d  I want to respond  \u201c Really   This teen  who have minimal family support or advocacy  have socially transition and have try to present a male for almost a year  with no medical assistance   \u201d  I think that \u2019 s amaze  Another doctor tell a  then future  client of mine he would need at least 3 month of RLE before get any type of medical assistance with transition  This be an overwhelming concept for most  and I \u2019 m glad my client pursue a session with me even after that  I think ask someone to have \u201c real life experience \u201d a the gender with which they identify in order to receive hormone be like ask someone to earn a prosthetic leg by run a marathon  For those of you who don \u2019 t know  \u201c Real Life Experience \u201d use to be a REQUIREMENT for those seek gender transition  It be  thankfully  become an antiquated concept  In the Standards of Care Version 6  2001   the Real Life Experience be define this way  \u201c The act of fully adopt a new or evolve gender role or gender presentation in everyday life be know a the reallife experience  The reallife experience be essential to the transition to the gender role that be congruent with the patient \u2019 s gender identity  Since change one \u2019 s gender presentation have immediate profound personal and social consequence  the decision to do so should be precede by an awareness of what the familial  vocational  interpersonal  educational  economic  and legal consequence be likely to be  Professionals have a responsibility to discuss these predictable consequence with their patient  Change of gender role and presentation can be an important factor in employment discrimination  divorce  marital problem  and the restriction or loss of visitation right with child  These represent external reality issue that must be confront for success in the new gender presentation  These consequence may be quite different from what the patient imagine prior to undertake the reallife experience  However  not all change be negative \u201d Yes  there may be negative outcome to transition  Transitioning can be one of the most  if not the most  stressful undertaking an individual ever experience in his or her lifetime  However  these negative outcome be not a reason not to do it  they be side effect of someone live true to one \u2019 s self  Asking someone to transition without any assistance medically be quite simply a setup for more discrimination  and decrease the chance of a positive outcome  The ability to present more a the gender with which someone identifies while transition increase the chance of be accept and acknowledge a one \u2019 s assert gender  This individual describe it beautifully  \u201c Whilst individual vary greatly  some people have considerably more difficulty be read a their gender prior to HRT  Hormone Replacement Therapy   and AMAB  Assigned Male at Birth  people be more likely to receive certain form of harassment if people read them incorrectly  Forcing people into public face role to get the treatment they need put them at direct risk of violence  harassment and discrimination  What \u2018 real life \u2019 be be experience  From my own and others \u2019 experience  I know that live full time a a woman pre HRT be vastly different to be fulltime after a year on HRT  The near daily abuse and marginalization  with incumbent stress  be not the real life I \u2019 m experiencing now  but be a feature of living a a woman who be visibly trans  The RLE require be entirely unrepresentative \u201d In my opinion  the Real Life Experience requirement be a very tricky  if not dangerous  requirement for kid or adult to do before receive hormone treatment  Being tease  reject  and bully can be more of a risk when one be try to present a the \u201c opposite \u201d gender and not be able to pass due the presence of natal sex marker and the absence of trait of one \u2019 s assert gender  I understand it feel risky to prescribe quickly with a youth  but the decisionmaking should be base more on how consistent and persistent his male gender identity have be  his distress at be read a female  etc  Doctors seem to be just as resistant to prescribe hormone right away for adult who have decide to transition  So many people be worried about make certain the individual be \u201c sure \u201d  I can understand this  however how many people do you think be go to decide to transition when they be unsure about their gender identity  really  The most common source of indecision be the choice about ifwhen to transition  not one \u2019 s gender identity  About that most people be sure  especially when they make the big decision to undergo gender transition  Attempting to transition while struggle to \u201c pas \u201d may make someone more unsure about their decision to transition  but doesn \u2019 t change their gender identity  I recently watch \u201c TRANS \u201d  a documentary feature film  When speak about Christine McGinn  a successful and eloquent doctor  they tell about the step of her transition like this  \u201c First  live life a a woman \u201d Really   That \u2019 s FIRST   With no medical assistance of hormone to soften male facial structure  redistribute body fat  etc  Just simply  \u201c live life a a woman \u201d  This seem completely backwards  It simply make more sense to create physical change first to assist in pass a one \u2019 s assert gender  the gender identity in line with their brain   Allowing a transgender individual to medically transition IS the way to allow them to get on with life their real life  Making medical transition harder and less accessible be a sure way to increase stress  depression  and the risk of suicide in a population that already struggle with these issue far more than the general population  Wondering what the current version  Version 7  2011  of the Standards of Care say about \u201c Real Life Experience \u201d  From a weblog write by Dr Kelley Winters  \u201c The tone and language of the SOC7 be more positive than in previous version  with more emphasis on care and less emphasis on barrier to care  Some highlight include  \u2026  removal of the three month requirement for either \u201c real life experience \u201d  live in a congruent gender role  or psychotherapy before access to hormonal care \u201d Although this obstacle have be remove  \u201c 12 continuous month of living in a gender role that be congruent with their gender identity \u201d be still recommend prior to \u201c bottom surgery \u201d  Here \u2019 s to you  and live YOUR real life  whatever that may be  ", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando,
