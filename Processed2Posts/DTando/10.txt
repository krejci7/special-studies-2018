campaign to promote an educational conversation about the transgender community  This campaign be design to shift the conversation away from the problematic question that be often ask of the member transgender community and foster a more progressive dialogue  I be ask to be a \u201c featured voice \u201d in this campaign and provide my prospective about what TO ask and what NOT to ask trans people  Of course  I be but one voice in the sea of many  please check out the other response here  The prompt  What be the do \u2019 s and dont \u2019 s when ask a trans person about their experience  What be 2 \u2013 3 question that one should NOT be ask a transgender person  What be 2 \u2013 3 question that one SHOULD be ask a transgender person  I decide to go about this a little differently  Instead of list specific question one should or should not ask transgender people  I come up with guideline for decide which question be appropriate and which one be not  Know the Basics Before you begin ask too many question of the transgender individual  do some research on the basic  Many time when someone be reveal their \u201c true \u201d gender  or their brain gender identity  others go straight for the anatomy of the individual  Anatomy be about natal sex  not gender  The transgender individual likely want you to understand more about how they feel on the inside  not about what their body look like  Read my blog post here for more information about Gender Vs  Sex  Additionally  it will be helpful for you to understand the difference between gender identity and sexual orientation  If you don \u2019 t  you might accidentally start focus on the individual \u2019 s romantic life or sexual behavior when they be try to tell you about who they be  Read more about this distinction here  Use Empathy Put yourself in the other person \u2019 s shoe  It \u2019 s important to remember the transgender person be not there simply to educate you or satisfy your curiosity  They be a person  just like you  live their life  Try to figure out what kind of question you would like to be ask  and go from there  Would you want to be ask detail about your potentially painful past  Probably not  Would you want to be ask detail about your genitalia  Most likely not  See my blog post \u201c What \u2019 s In YOUR Pants    They \u2019 re call \u201c private \u201d for a reason  for more on this  What would you want someone to ask you about  You would probably want people to ask how you be  how your loved one be  and what you \u2019 ve be stay busy with  Ask  Stay in the Now The transgender person in front of you be not live in the past or the future  they be live in the present  Stay in it with them  What name they be give at birth  the process of their transition  their plan for medical intervention in the future  etc  do not give you a sense for what that person be about  today  Ask them about their here and now  in general term  If the transgender individual \u2019 s gender identity or transition come up in this conversation  that mean it be relevant for them in the present  Think in Terms of Solidarity If you think of yourself in a different category than transgender people  a separation be create that do not need to exist  We all have gender identity  and that make u capable of understand it  You don \u2019 t have to have go through something exactly a someone else have to relate to that person  Many of the problem transgender individual face be in regard to stigma  discrimination  and lack of understand from society at large  Since we be all a part of society  we be all capable of create change  Make sure you be use the correct name and pronoun for the individual  Speak up if you hear someone who be not  Speak up if you hear transphobic language  practice  policy  or potentially unwelcoming space for transgender individual  Think Beyond the Binary Society tend to operate a though there be two gender  male and female  In reality  gender be on a spectrum and male and female be but two gender on it  Every person be the expert on their own gender identity  Trust what they say to be true for them  even if you can \u2019 t relate to it or haven \u2019 t heard of it before  Some people feel male or female  Some people feel both  and some people feel neither  Some people feel more one gender than another  and some fluctuate from day to day  Operate from the standpoint that you be there to honor and respect their gender  not decide what it be or what you be comfortable with  The only way to have a relationship with someone be to honor them for who they truly be  Happy Conversing  ", "feedtitle": "Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
