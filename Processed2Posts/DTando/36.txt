"text": "I create this \u201c gender lesson \u201d for teacher to present in school base on the need of gender nonconforming child I see in my private practice and those I read about online  Please share with any and all classroomsteachers  Below be the lesson  and follow that will be a PDF with the lesson and a list of \u201c expectation \u201d that can be post in the classroom  This lesson be create in particular for those teacher who have gender nonconforming child in their classroom  However  it be my belief that this curriculum be need in ALL classroom  to change society \u2019 s stereotype  reduce stigmatization of child  decrease bullying  and increase acceptance of each other  This lesson be to be present at the very beginning of the school year to set standard of expectation for behavior  and can be review a need throughout the school year  It should be appropriate for grades K5  please modify a need  Role play be include at the end of the lesson for comprehension reinforcement  Give the child the scenario and have them attempt the correct response first  give suggestion a need  Lastly  please hang the attached rule in your classroom a a reminder of the acceptance that be expect  For a very long time  people have be separate thing into what girl like and what boys like  A lot of people think these thing be very different  and call them \u201c boy thing \u201d and \u201c girl thing \u201d  Have YOU notice that  What be some thing some people might say be \u201c girl thing \u201d or \u201c boy thing \u201d  What might some people say be \u201c girl toy \u201d and \u201c boy toy \u201d  The truth be  all child get to pick what they like  and everyone like different thing  Repeat after me  There be no such thing a a \u201c boy thing \u201d or a \u201c girl thing \u201d  Some kid be boy who like thing that other people think be for girl  Some kid be girl who like thing that other people think be for boy  It can hurt their feeling if you or someone else say something to them about it  or act like there be rule about how someone should be  That would be like say only girl can eat ice cream  and only boy can eat jelly bean   That would just be SILLY  Sweets and treat be to be enjoy by everyone  just like most thing in life  Are there certain color that some people think only girl like and color that only boys like  Most people think girl like pink and purple  which be ok  but it \u2019 s silly to think that ONLY girl like pink and purple  There be plenty of boy out there who like pink and purple  too  Lots of people think only boys can like blue  Girls can like blue  too  All the color of the rainbow be for everyone  and it \u2019 s fun that we all get to pick our favorite  You don \u2019 t want anyone tell YOU what your favorite color should be  do you   Some people also have very strong idea about how boy and girl should look and dress  Is it ok for some girl to have short hair  and some boy to have long hair  Of course it be  How someone choose to dress be up to them  too  Some girl wear skirt and dress  and some girl wear short and pant  Some boy wear short and pant  and some boy wear skirt and dress  This may surprise some people  but it certainly isn \u2019 t wrong  How someone dress and wear their hair be a part of their \u201c style \u201d  Everyone \u2019 s style be different  What if everyone be to dress and look exactly alike  BORING  The next time you see someone who wear their hair a little different than you expect or be wear something that surprise you  be kind and say  \u201c I like your style \u201d  How wonderful would it be to have a classroom  or a WORLD  where kid just get to like what they like  Are you ready to help create a world like that  One of the most important thing to remember be to be KIND to one another  Ask yourself how you would feel if you be the other person  Be sure to avoid say anything that would hurt someone else \u2019 s feeling  If you can see another kid like something  don \u2019 t tell them why they shouldn \u2019 t  Remind yourself  \u201c different people like different thing \u201d  \u201c it \u2019 s OK to be different \u201d  and \u201c I be accept of others \u201d  If you hear someone tell another kid there be rule about how to play  how to be  or how to dress  stand up for them  Remember  you be help create a world that be more accept  Nicely tell the other person what you have learn from this lesson  You can say something like this  \u201c That \u2019 s their style  and I like it \u201d \u201c Anyone can play with anything \u201d \u201c Everyone be different  Different people like different things \u201d \u201c Please don \u2019 t tease my friend  I like himher just the way heshe is \u201d Remember  THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A \u201c BOY THING \u201d OR A \u201c GIRL THING \u201d  All toy be for all child  Colors be for everyone  People be different  and everyone like different thing  Everyone get to pick how they wear their hair  Everyone get to pick the way they dress  Everyone get to pick their own style  Role Plays  Act out the RIGHT way to handle the following situation  You be play house  and a girl want to be the dad  You hear someone tease a boy about wear a skirt  A group of boy play soccer tell a girl  \u201c You can \u2019 t play  No girl allow  \u201d You \u2019 re have a tea party and a boy want to join in  You see a girl get tease for have short hair  You see a boy wear a pink backpack  In Our Classroom\u2026 We be kind to each other  All toy be for all child  Colors be for
