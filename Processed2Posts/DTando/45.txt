International Foundation for Gender Education  conference in Washington  DC call \u201c Ignorance  Questions  and Fears  Oh My   Surviving the Reactions of Others \u201d  I will be use some of the concept from that presentation for the next 4 week of my blog  various aspect of the \u201c reaction of others \u201d  My hope be that it may be helpful not only to those who be come out to family and friend a transgender  but also to those who be on the receive end of such big news or may be pass along the news by proxy  Please understand that my above use of the word \u201c ignorance \u201d be by no mean mean to be offensive  I do not equate it to be unintelligent or unwilling to learn  My use of the word in the title simply refers to someone who doesn \u2019 t know much  or anything   about the concept of gender dysphoriabeing transgender  I choose to present on this topic because it be by far the most commonly bring up issue in therapy for my client who be transition  In fact  I think it can be the most difficult part of transition  I be write this blog to help those prepare to disclose  as well a help those who have be hurt by the reaction of others in the past  I hope this will help those individual reflect upon where their love one may have be come from so that heal can happen  Additionally  my intention be for this series of blog to normalize the feeling that friend and family member may have a they absorb the concept of how their love one feel and what he or she be about to do  This topic may also be useful to the love one when they themselves have to disclose to others about the transgender friend or family member to others  Of course  it be my wish that the more knowledge I can spread  the less hurtful the comingout process will be for all party involve  Shock and Awe  Take Cover Many love one of a transgender individual be shock when they hear the news of their loved one \u2019 s true gender identity andor plan to transition  even if they may have witness gender nonconforming behavior for year  Shock itself be an intense emotion  and therefore can cause impulsive  insensitive reaction  Shock can get rid of the \u201c filter \u201d that people have most of the time  This impulsivity may cause others to say the first few thing that come to their mind  As you know  say the first thing that come to your mind when high emotion be involve be usually not a good idea  When a transgender individual be disclose  he or she be in a vulnerable place  I can almost guarantee you that he or she be hop for a good response  and can be shake to the core by a negative one  Things that be say in those first few moment of disclosure may be something the transgender individual remembers for many year to come  This be why disclose through email or letter can often be easy  As much a I appreciate the value of facetoface communication  I be a therapist  after all    this may just be one of those situation where a letter be appropriate  A letter give the discloser the opportunity to really think about what to say and how to say it   A letter can also be revise many time  unlike say it all out loud   Those on the receive end get to read and absorb it before a conversation take place  Having some time and space to process it be a great way to avoid say the first thing that come to mind  It allow the other \u2019 s initial reaction to be there without the discloser necessarily know everything about it   Again  as much a I be for open communication  there be some thing that be simply well leave unsaid   Those of you who be prepare to disclose  about yourself or on behalf of a transgender person you love  it \u2019 s important to prepare yourself for possible hurtful statement on behalf of others\u2026particularly if you expect them to be \u201c shock \u201d  Preparing be not about anticipate negative response to the extent of be fearful  or even hold back from share  Anticipating what may be in store will help you take good care of yourself in the moment  Remind yourself it be part of the process  and thing WILL get well over time  It \u2019 s important to have answer and boundary ready to go so that you be not catch off guard   I \u2019 ll be talk more about responding and boundary in the next few blog   Additionally  it may be helpful to try to understand the feeling the other person might have and therefore what may be behind the statement  This may make the statement easy to tolerate and make you less likely to \u201c take them on \u201d a your own  Remember  you be identify the feeling a someone else \u2019 s  not yours  Check out my previous blog entry \u201c It \u2019 s Hard for Moms \u201d  If you be a transgender individual preparing to come out  good luck\u2026 you can do it  I \u2019 ve see the process many time and have witnessedbeen privy to a wide spectrum of response  Loved one who have a hard time with it at first eventually DO come around  If you be the loved one of a transgender individual  you be likely past the \u201c come out \u201d period since you be read this blog  However  if you feel you may have say some thing initially that could have hurt your loved one  apologize  It \u2019 s never too late for heal to happen  ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
