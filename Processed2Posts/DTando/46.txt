I get some request for a blog about Gender Identity v  Sexual Orientation  Happy to oblige  For those of you hip to this scene  it might be something you \u2019 ve heard before  perhaps say a bit differently  For those of you still learn  I hope this will serve to clear up some confusion  I apologize in advance for the length of this blog\u2026 although I could have say more  trust me  I \u2019 ve heard gender identity describe a \u201c who you be \u201d and sexual orientation a \u201c who you want to have sex with \u201d  I agree with this  but there \u2019 s a lot more to it  Gender identity refers to what gender your brain be  who you be  and how you want others to see you  What gender you identify with be go to impact many area of your life  if not all  It will affect how you be see in society  how others respond to you  how you be address  expectation for your behavior  where you go to the bathroom  your role in your family  and much more  Sexual orientation refers to who you be attract to  who you would like to receive romantic attentionaffection from  and who you would like to be sexually intimate with  I \u2019 d even like to say sexual orientation not only refer to the sex  anatomy  one be attract to  but also the gender  Certainly  anatomy play a big part in sexual relationship  but the gender of the individual be likely what capture your attention in the first place  I would also suggest that gender be more of a factor in date and relationship than one \u2019 s anatomy  Ultimately  who you be sexually attract to doesn \u2019 t have a lot to do with who you be and how you present on a daytoday basis  To whom you be attract doesn \u2019 t matter when you be check out at the grocery store  Since our standard greeting don \u2019 t entail \u201c Hello  Lesbian \u201d and \u201c Thank you  Gay Man \u201d but \u201c Hello  Ma \u2019 be \u201d and \u201c Thank you  Sir \u201d  you can see how gender identity be a more pervasive issue and one that affect an individual even more regularly than sexual orientation  Who you go to bed with that night doesn \u2019 t matter when you \u2019 re out interact with society  Additionally  one may not go to bed with anyone that night\u2026 or have a sex life to speak of  but one \u2019 s gender and how it impact a person be unavoidable  Do child have a gender identity  Yes  usually child have a clear understanding of be either a boy or a girl  If you can \u2019 t remember think about your gender a a child  it \u2019 s likely because your assigned gender match with your natal sex   Natal meaning \u201c of  relate to  or present at birth  associate with one \u2019 s birth \u201d  In this blog when I say \u201c natal male \u201d or \u201c natal female \u201d it be refer to one \u2019 s anatomy  or sex  present at birth   Do child have a sexual orientation  Not really  Children be not sexual being  However  at what age do you remember \u201c like \u201d or have crush on other people  Developmentally  this usually happen in elementary school  \u201c Wanting to have sex with \u201d either girl or boy be not usually a factor during elementary school  However  whisper about  send note to  and giggle in the presence of one \u2019 s crush usually be  Therefore  it be at this age when some child realize they be interested in member of the same sex  but this win \u2019 t become a sexual idea for some time  I remember many year ago watch a Larry King show with transgender guest  He ask a trans man  who be in a relationship with a female   \u201c Wouldn \u2019 t it just have be easy to stay a lesbian  \u201d  While the question seem absurd to me at the time  I suppose it echo the question of many people who don \u2019 t understand the need to transition  Easier  Yes  I suppose avoid transition would be the easy choice in some way  The good choice  No  Opting to live a life in a gender that feel foreign be the making of a rough journey  Staying sociallybiologically female and be a lesbian would allow the individual to continue to sleep with woman  but all other area of life would be more difficult  For example  think of the name \u201c Mom \u201d and \u201c Dad \u201d  If the trans man be to live his life \u201c a a lesbian \u201d and have child  his name might be \u201c Mom \u201d or a version thereof  This simply doesn \u2019 t fit with his gender identity and would likely sound a strange to him a it would to any natal male who be a father  Another example would be this same person  continue to present a female  take  his  wife out to dinner  and the server say  \u201c Hello  Ladies \u201d  Cringing inside every time  he  hear the reference to  himself  a female be most certainly not the \u201c easy \u201d way to go  Additionally  ask a trans man about \u201c stay a lesbian \u201d be actually a misnomer  A trans man be not  and never have be  a lesbian  Yes  many transgender individual come out a gay prior to understand their gender identity or come out a trans  Because be gay be presently more accepted and understood than be transgender  this may be the only way a transgender individual know how to identify at first  If a natal female be attract to woman   s  he may assume  s  he be a lesbian and may come out a such  before realize he actually identify a male  Often time one \u2019 s gender identity be understood later which then invalidate a previously think sexual orientation  The fact that gender identity and sexual orientation be two separate entity be precisely why someone can be transgender AND gay  For example  a natal male who have the brain gender identity of a female may transition to a woman and also be attract to woman  thereby make her a lesbian   Stew on that one  Larry King   I can hear it now  \u201c If the male be attract to woman already  why transition to be a woman only then to be a lesbian  Wouldn \u2019 t it be easy to stay a straight man  \u201d  Forgive me if I \u2019 m be redundant  but this person never be a straight man and therefore could not \u201c stay \u201d one  The abovereferenced person could date woman  but would perceive a a straight man  which would likely cause great distress  This be because one \u2019 s gender identity be a pervasive  essential fact to everything one do during the day  One \u2019 s sex life be only an element  While these two concept be different  they be not entirely separate  Gender identity and sexual orientation affect one another in the bedroom  Sexual relation be not only about who you want to sleep with  but how you want your sex partner to treat and perceive you  A transgender woman will likely want to be treat sexually a a woman  whether she be choose to be sexual with a man or a woman  This be because the former be about gender identity  the latter about sexual orientation  Additionally  one \u2019 s gender identity must be factor in to understand one \u2019 s sexual orientation  To summarize gender identity  Someone with a male gender identity  natal male or not  will want to be treat a a man in the grocery store  by society  by his family  and in the bedroom  Someone with a female gender identity  natal female or not  will want to be treat a a woman in the grocery store  by society  by her family  and in the bedroom  To summarize sexual orientation  Someone with a male gender identity  natal male or not  who be attract to men be gay  Someone with a male gender identity  natal male or not  who be attract to woman be straight  Someone with a female gender identity  natal female or not  who be attract to men be straight  Someone with a female gender identity  natal female or not  who be attract to woman be gay  Of course  I \u2019 m a oppose to box a anyone else\u2026 there be all sort of beautiful nuance of both sexuality and gender identity  Please forgive me for make this blog seem like both be black and white  This be for the sake of simplicity  ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene
