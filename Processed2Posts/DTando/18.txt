early 2006 I be establish my private practice while I be still work at the Naval Medical Center San Diego  As a way of get new client  I advertise on Craigslist  I be a little leery of do this  for fear it would attract people not exactly look for therapy  True  I get a couple of offcolor inquiry  but thankfully these be easy to screen a not legitimate  Since I have never before work with gender nonconforming client  my ad say nothing about that  Here be a snippet from that ad  \u201c Although I specialize in work with child  I also work with adult individual and couple  I find that my warm and empathetic approach that work so well with child also help to create a safe  therapeutic environment for adult which promote progress in therapy \u201d Perhaps it be the way the ad be phrase that make someone struggle with their true identity reach out to me  \u201c Hello  I be wonder if you offer any type of therapy that deal with gender reassignment  \u2026  If you don \u2019 t  and happen to know of someone please send me their name  Thanks \u201d Unfortunately  I don \u2019 t have the response I write back to him  but this be the return email  \u201c Darlene  Thank you so much for respond to my message  You be right it be a hard step a it will be the first talk contact for me  I appreciate your honesty in tell me that you have not work with any transgendered  sic  patient  Doesn \u2019 t bother me one bit  In all honesty  I feel like I know where I be at as far a how I feel about the situation  Where I be have my big doubt and fear be when it come to tell my family and friend about my issuefeelings  The fear of their reaction be kind of hold me back   \u2026  For some reason I feel like we can work together  and you can help me a lot   \u2026  I have a few other question regard my letter for T  and top surgery  but I \u2019 m sure we can discuss these at a late time  Which name would you like  My birth name or what I plan  at this moment  to go by  Thank you \u201d I don \u2019 t have my response but I do know it include this question  \u201c What be T  \u201d  This always make me smile think back to it  \u201c T \u201d  reference Testosterone  be now a standard  almost daily   part of my vocabulary  I also know that even though I hadn \u2019 t be \u201c train \u201d yet in gender therapy  I know to of course ask for his preferred name  That be the name I have call him ever since  and have never once call him his birth name  There be SO many thing I have to learn after I start work with him and soon thereafter many more transgender individual  However  the concept of be transgender never confuse or fascinate me  It just seem so simple  pursue alignment to match one \u2019 s gender identity  As I \u2019 ve say before  some people \u201c get it \u201d and some people don \u2019 t  I get it  Our first session focus on a psychosocial assessment and discuss his goal for gender transition  He need to educate me about some thing  but I also make it clear I would be do research and pursue my own education about this  I know that just because he be my first transgender client it wasn \u2019 t his job to teach me everything I need to know in order to give him the best care  He leave me with his copy of \u201c Testosterone Files \u201d by Max Valerio which I promptly read  After all the book I \u2019 ve read on this topic  I \u2019 m always glad that be my first  I felt it be a very informative and wellwritten account of someone transition from female to male  Here be part of the email I receive after our first session  \u201c Hey Darlene  I just want to say thank you for take time out to talk with me today  I admit I be really nervous before we start  but I end up more comfortable than I think I be go to be  I also want you to know that you be very easy to talk to  and I believe you be go to be able to help me figure out what I need to do  I actually leave your place with a feeling of relief for the first time  Somehow I feel a if thing be go to be all right eventually for me  Thanks  Looking forward to our next session  \u201d This client be travel quite a way to see me  which be my first clue there be not a plethora of other therapist work with this population  He connect me with his case manager from the former STAR  program  \u201c Supporting Transgender Access to Resources \u201d  The care manager reiterate the lack of therapist for this community and be soon send me MANY more transgender client  I do my best to get equip for the detail of my newfound duty  write letter for hormone treatment and surgery  help client access resource  assist them in the come out and transition process  I read book  attend conference  and attend monthly FTMI  Female to Male International  meeting at the LGBT Center here in San Diego  Soon I be lead a weekly support group for FTM individual in addition to the client I be see oneonone  I be so grateful to all the people and client I interact with during that time  I learn so much from them and become more committed to and invest in my work than ever  At first my gender therapy be only with adult client  Soon  my name be \u201c out there \u201d and I begin see gender nonconforming and transgender child  Since my specialty have always be work with child and my newfound specialty be gender therapy  this be a beautiful and serendipitous melding of the two  When I first find out about the substantial lack of gender therapist in San Diego  I didn \u2019 t understand why  Why weren \u2019 t there more if the need be so high  Was there something I be miss  Was I look at this too simply  that these people come to me know their true gender and just need some help get there  Over 8 year later  I can answer  no  I wasn \u2019 t miss anything  This work truly be that cut and dry  the client be the expert on their own gender identity  I be just here to help and support them along the journey  My first client have tell me many time how I \u201c change his life \u201d  but I can honestly say he change mine in much the same way  He give me a specialty that I be deeply passionate about  I be absolutely inspired and energize by my work  In an amazing \u201c parallel universe \u201d kind of way  enter into this particular niche have help someone very significant to me discover their true gender identity and therefore transition  Because of this  gender transition be a part of both my professional and personal life  and I wouldn \u2019 t have it any other way  To my \u201c OG \u201d client  THANK YOU  Thank you for give me a chance  For trust me with such a huge undertaking in your life even though I have no \u201c experience \u201d  Thank you for bless me with this amazing work I get to do  And  thank you for let me share part of your email here  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
