"tags": ["Uncategorized"], "text": "A big part of what I do be help individual explore their gender  assert their true gender identity  and help family member adjust to transition that occur  In addition to this  I \u2019 m a big believer in change our society \u2019 s understanding of gender so that we can pave an easy path for LGBT youth  and adult  for that matter    In my presentation  I talk about Blank Slate Parenting a a way to point out parent really don \u2019 t know the gender and sexual orientation of their child until the childteen be able to share it with them  I also include this concept in my book  The Conscious Parent \u2019 s Guide to Gender Identity  Here be the excerpt  \u201c Blank slate \u201d parenting be the ability for a parent to enter into parenthood without too many assumption and expectation  This may sound difficult  but it be possible  Most parent enter into parenthood with some basic assumption  their child be go to be cisgender  their gender identity \u201c match \u201d their birth sex   gender conform  their interest and expression be in line with what most expect from their birth gender   and heterosexual  Considering that many child be not these thing  these assumption may be inaccurate and possibly detrimental for both the parent and the child  Unless a parent be have an intersex baby  the parent will likely find out they be have a natal male or a natal female  either during the pregnancy or when the baby be bear  Once this be reveal  all sort of association be create  If the child be a natal male  bear with male anatomy   the parent will likely assume the child will always identify a a boy and will engage in the \u201c typical \u201d interest and affinity of most boy  If the child be a natal female  bear with female anatomy   the parent will assume that she will always identify a a girl and will engage in the \u201c typical \u201d interest and affinity of what society expect girl to be interested in  If the child be a natal female  parent often assume they will one day be interest in male  If the child be a natal male  parent often assume they will one day be interest in female  Even if these assumption be not explicitly state  they will implicitly become the foundation of what your child understands be expect of them  Children have an inherent need to please their parent  so feeling \u201c other than \u201d what their parent expect can range from uncomfortable to downright scary  Anything other than what have be envision and assume result in the parent need to make a \u201c shift \u201d in what they have expect  The nature of the shift will depend on how tie the parent be to their expectation  and what this difference mean to them personally  socially  and culturally  What if  instead of adopt these basic assumption  parent remain open to who or what their child be or will become  What if parent provide a blank canvas for their child to paint  rather than provide a paintbynumbers template  What if society evolve to the extent that people understand the difference between sex and gender  and the knowledge that some people be simply born transgender  Imagine how much easy it would be if parent understand not to get too attach to the sex of their child at birth  What if parent learn to ask \u201c Do you feel like a boy or a girl  Both  Or neither  \u201d instead of tell the child who they be base on anatomy  What if society at large acknowledge be gaylesbianbisexual a a natural way to be  a way of be that be just a valid and recognize a heterosexual  What if parent learn to say  \u201c Do you like boy or girl  Both  Or neither  \u201d instead of make assumption of a heteronormative nature  Parenting from a blank slate standpoint would essentially eliminate the \u201c come out \u201d process  Children would be able to evolve and share a their identity develop  They would not have to hide part of who they be for fear they might be disappoint their parent  They would not have to overcome the expectationsassumptions that be place on them at birth  They would simply be their authentic self  and parent would know these self sooner rather than later  Rather than make assumption  ask question  often and early  to help learn who your child be  The question will serve two purpose  you will learn about your child  and your child will learn that there be a beautiful spectrum of human diversity  not just box in which one have to fit  In order to provide a blank slate for your child so that they can be free to display their authentic self  you must be mindful of your own projection and assumption  Such thing impede the ability of your child have an actual blank slate on which to create  Recognize your child be their own individual be  and that you be lucky to witness their true self unfold  Remain curious about how this little individual will turn out  Your message to your child  both implicitly and explicitly should always be  \u201c Any way you be be OK \u201d More tip for \u201c blank slate \u201d parenting  Instead of assume and then wait for them to correct you  ask about who your child be  Expose them to and talk about diversity  different family structure  identity  and community  Be aware of language  Avoid use the gender dichotomy like \u201c boy and girl \u201d  Try not to use strongly gendered language to refer to your child and others  Incorporate many genderneutral phrase and expression to allow more space for your child to decide how they relate to gender  Excerpted from The Conscious Parent \u2019 s Guide to
