discovery transgender people go through and how there be often two major part  realize one be transgender  have the gender identity of something other than their sex at birth  and decide what they be go to do about it  normally describe a \u201c transition \u201d  For the sake of this specific blog \u2019 s concept  I \u2019 ll be describe the process a transgender person go through a alignment and the process the loved one go through a transition  If the transgender person choose to go through the process of change their gender  they be align themselves with their \u201c real \u201d gender  There be several definition of align  the one I choose for this topic be \u201c to move or be adjust into proper relationship or orientation \u201d  It \u2019 s critical people understand the choice to transition be a way of make thing right  not decide to change something that be already perfect  Deciding to align oneself be typically the result of many year of contemplation  possible ambivalence  agonizing  the weighing of option  and consider all outcome  Finally make the \u201c big decision \u201d can bring on feeling of relief  gratitude  and excitement  mainly because they have decide to ALIGN themselves  and that be a positive thing  Yet these feeling be not usually share by the loved one of the transgender individual  They be the one who have to fully transition from an idea they have about who their loved one be to something different  Transition  \u201c change or passage from one state or stage to another \u201d  When you reveal your gender identity andor plan to align yourself  you be ask your love one to adjust to the idea that you be about to change  when they like you just the way you be   Additionally  the change love one anticipate tends to be more dramatic than what happen in reality  so there be fear involve here  too   They be often present with year of your contemplation deliver in one single revelation  in a moment they be force to adjust to an entirely different idea of you than they have in the moment before  Hundreds of thing likely go through their head in that moment  thing that you have be contemplate for some time now  Whatever their initial reaction  remind yourself they be play \u201c catch up \u201d and will likely need some time  Although all of you be involve in this big change  these two perspective can make this experience very different for each of you  This depend on whether you be align yourself with something that feel good to you  or have to transition to an idea that feel altogether foreign  The Cold Lake Analogy Picture this  you want to go swimming in a very cold lake  You first stick your toe in  shiver a bit  but forge ahead  Slowly  inch by inch  you submerge your body in the lake  It \u2019 s uncomfortable  but you \u2019 re determine to take a swim  Once you have be tread water for about 510 minute  the water seem to feel much warmer  Eventually it \u2019 s hard to remember you think the water be cold at all  You see your friend and yell  \u201c Come on in  the water \u2019 s fine  \u201d  They stick their toe in  Their response  \u201c Are you serious   It \u2019 s FREEZING  \u201d  Looking at you submerge in the water  smile  your friend just can \u2019 t understand what it be you be do  or how it feel good to you  This tend to be the way a loved one look upon the transition  by the time the transgender individual \u201c come out \u201d  they have be adjust to the \u201c water \u201d for much long  One thing to keep in mind from this analogy be that the water both people be feel be the exact same water  the same temperature  The difference in their interpretation of the feeling of the water largely come from how long each have be get use to it  The positive spin on this be that give more time  the other person may be tread water before you know it  To the loved one of transgender individual  when your love one reveals their plan to align themselves with their brain gender identity  please keep in mind they be reveal a way to make themselves right  They be not do something to you  or try to disrupt something you like just the way it be  They be try to be whole  they be try to be happy  To the transgender individual  this be my gentle reminder that you be ask your loved one to jump into a very cold lake  Be patient  be kind  to them and yourselves  and keep your eye on the prize\u2026 YOU  align  ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
