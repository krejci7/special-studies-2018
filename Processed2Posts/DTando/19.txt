they \u2019 re go to lose their child in some way when their child transition  I \u2019 ve hear several parent say this impending loss feel like a death  and they prepare to grieve accordingly  It \u2019 s never really that they be feel that way  usually they be scar they be go to feel that way when their child transition  I tell them most parent end up not feel that way  a their child will still be here  but they win \u2019 t know this until they go through it themselves  Really  the parent be not lose their child  The child  again  I \u2019 m talk about \u201c adult child \u201d  too  be go to be the same person they always be  The parent be only now begin to understand what pronoun and gender identity go along with who their child really be  The main loss be that of pronoun and a mental image of who the parent think they be  Recently  a father make it clear he have not experienced loss a a result of his child \u2019 s transition  I want desperately to bottle up his word and give them to each parent I see who be struggle with a sense of impend loss in regard to their transgender child  So  I do the next best thing  I ask him to write a blog post about it  Without further ado  please read these word from a father who have gain so much  \u201c AntiLoss \u2013 By Peter T Emma be our second child  bear from the love her mother and I share and want to manifest in the world  In the day after we learn she be pregnant  my wife and I have no idea if she would give birth to a boy or a girl \u2013 and to both of u  it make no difference  whatsoever  Whether our baby  our child  our young adult be a boy or a girl be pretty much irrelevant  as long a they grow up happy  strong  know they be deeply love and accept for their unique and beautiful self  Our baby be bear in the body of a girl\u2026 but in this baby  nature decide to do an interesting thing  Somehow  the heart and mind and spirit of a son be insert into the body of a girl  We a parent  be such literal and visual creature  take the visual presentation of our baby to be all we need to know about gender  The doctor say \u201c It \u2019 s a girl  \u201d and we believe  We go about dress our baby and our child a a girl\u2026 give \u201c her \u201d girl activities\u2026 and investing in our expectation about what \u201c she \u201d would grow up to be  As our child grow up and be able to begin to make choice in clothing  friend and activity  it be gradually apparent that our idea about \u201c be a girl \u201d weren \u2019 t really fit this small person  Still  we take our child to ballet lesson and set up tea party with classmate  buy cute dress and imagine the lifeahead for \u201c her \u201d \u2013 and our child seem to participate in these thing happily\u2026 up to a point  but beneath the seeminglyaccepting exterior of this small person  inner turmoil be brew  We  a parent of transgender teen  all have our story of how our child make their truth know to u and how we initially \u2013 and then eventually \u2013 react to their need  I win \u2019 t lengthen this writing by share mine in detail  but I will acknowledge that I definitely have to go through my own reprogramming\u2026 adjusting in some fundamental way  how I perceive my child  The child I have know for 13 year a Emma now be to be call Andrew\u2026 \u201c she \u201d be to be \u201c he \u201d and a whole new world of concern for his welfare appear \u2013 in addition to the one that come standard with every teen  I have be so very fortunate to be include in my son Andrew \u2019 s counsel session  All sort of truth rise to the surface there that \u201c real life \u201d often doesn \u2019 t allow time or space for  A few week ago  I say something to Andrew in counsel that I \u2019 d say several time before \u2013 but this time  he finally make it clear that what I \u2019 d say be hurt him  What I \u2019 d say be that he be at something of a disadvantage in pass a male  because  a a girl  he be quite pretty \u2013 and that give him an obstacle to overcome in look masculine  Andrew share with me that when I say thing like that  he felt a though I be say I have lose something \u2013 that I have lose my \u201c pretty daughter \u201d \u2026 and clearly  it hurt him to feel that who he truly be inside \u2013 and now  outside be something \u201c less \u201d to me  I be very sad to know that my observation about \u201c what he use to be \u201d cause him to feel I have lose something along the way  The truth be so entirely opposite \u2013 for me it have be \u201c antiloss \u201d \u2013 ONLY gain \u2013 a I have see my child stand up and speak his truth and claim his real life \u2013 against all odds  despite peer pressure  despite fear of ridicule  in the face of the certainty that his road ahead would be so very hard  I tell him then\u2026 and I will remind him often\u2026 that he be so very much more than I ever could have hop for in a child  in a son  in a young man who I be so entirely proud to have in my life  What be it again  What do I wish for\u2026 back in those day before his mother and I know his eye color or his name  What be it that we have hop for  above all  I have wish for a child who would be able to grow up happy and strong\u2026 who would face difficult challenge with integrity and intelligence\u2026 who would know himself deeply \u2013 and from that knowledge  live a life fill with love and joy and passionsabounding  In my lovely son  I have find example of all those thing that I  myself  can only hope to aspire to  His process of become himself be such an incredible honor to participate in and I hope  a he grow into the amazing man I know he will be  that he always know that his parent accept him and love him deeply and completely  There be nothing here but gain \u201d Thank you  Peter  for your beautiful word and share your perspective  Thank you also to Andrew for let me share part of your story  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Gender
