Your Gender Variant Child  Teasing  Please read it before read this blog post if you haven \u2019 t already  One of the main point of my previous blog post be about the importance of parent avoid warn a child about how their interest  way of dress  etc  may result in tease  This increase anxiety and make the child wary  rather than equip them with cop skill  Helping Your Gender Nonconforming Child With Teasing Key concept  Gender Identity  How someone identify in his or her brain  male or female  Gender Expression  How a person may choose to dress or express gender  feminine or masculine  May be in line with gender identity or may not  may be in line with assigned birth gender and may not  Gender Nonconformity  Conform mean to \u201c behave accord to socially acceptable convention or standard \u201d  Being gender nonconforming be not subscribe to society \u2019 s gender \u201c rule \u201d  what colorsdressinterests be for girl and which be for boy  These societal rule be always change  and it \u2019 s my belief these gender rule win \u2019 t always be so rigid  Coaching your child  It \u2019 s our job a parent to teach our kid how to behave  right  Remember  gender identity be not a behavior  It be simply a core characteristic of a person  whether they feel male or female  Gender expression  if it be a reflection of their gender identity  be not a behavior that should be mold or change to prevent teasing  If your child have a behavior that be negatively impact others  and be a behavior they can change  coach them about this   Examples of this might be if they themselves be tease peer  if they be physically aggressive  bossy in play  etc   If it \u2019 s not a behavior they can change  teach them how to care for themselves in response to behavior from others  Why do kid tease  There be so many reason why kid tease  because they themselves have be tease  they want to feel powerful  they want to impress other kid  etc  Why do gender nonconformity elicit tease  A gender variant child be even more susceptible to tease give that they tend to behave or dress in a way that can be unexpected by other child or deem by other child to be \u201c different \u201d  As most of u know  those that be \u201c different \u201d or in the minority be more likely to be tease  get tease more often  and often more severely than other child  Also  kid be focus on rule  Since the day they begin explore their world  they begin learn about rule  Don \u2019 t touch that  don \u2019 t do that  can \u2019 t go there  don \u2019 t eat that  etc  It \u2019 s how kid learn about the world around them and learn what work  Things fit into category so that it make the world make sense  The more one be able to categorize something  the less think one have to do about it  and the less discomfort it bring up  When something doesn \u2019 t follow the \u201c rule \u201d a child have be teach  there be discomfort  possible anxiety and kid work to have their world make sense again  They have be teach specific rule  \u201c pink be for girl  boy don \u2019 t cry  girl don \u2019 t like sport  boy can \u2019 t wear skirt  etc \u201d When a peer \u2019 s gender expression doesn \u2019 t fall in line with these \u201c rule \u201d  kid can compulsively make it their job to let them know they be not follow the \u201c rule \u201d  Additionally  because kid be essentially be control much of the time  it be likely an outlet for them to try to be the one to control others occasionally  Teasing vs Bullying what \u2019 s the difference  Teasing  Can be do by friend or kid who be not friend  can be do in a friendlyfun way  or in a mean way  Typically mild by nature  Does not cause major distress on behalf of the child be tease  Bullying  Greater intensity  more frequent  and can also be much more hurtful or damage  Typically meanspirited  Important distinction between the two  teasing be a behavior or an act that be temporary or occasional  Bullying may be ongoing  daily  etc  Most important clarification be how much distress it bring to your child  If child start to have somatic complaint  headache  stomachache   want to avoid school  etc  they may likely be get bully at school  Responses by caregiver to both  Teasing  Caregivers process incident  talk about feeling  with child and empower child to stand up for self  ignore  problem solve  Bullying  Caregivers may need to intervene  get school  or other  authority involve  advocate  make sure bullying be address  Ways to support and empower your gender nonconforming child  Stay connect  Ask the best and bad part of day at bedtimedinnertime  If your child seem to clam up under oneonone questioning  a question in the car  With your eye on the road and not on the child  some child tend to open up more  When your child report teasing  ask question  fight the impulse to just give \u201c answer \u201d  You will find out a lot more about your child \u2019 s feeling about and ability to handle the teasing if you avoid jump in and try to \u201c fix \u201d  Again  don \u2019 t warn about the potential to be tease  If your child ask if you think they may be tease  be honest  \u201c Maybe \u201d Ask question  \u201c What do you think  \u201d Model confidence that even if you do think teasing may result  your child can handle it   If you be nervous about the

of their core self   This be important for ALL kid  not just gender nonconforming kid   Model appropriate response to others if they question or mock your child \u2019 s gender expression or reflection of gender identity  Be it in response to a family friend or a stranger at the grocery store  don \u2019 t apologize for your child \u2019 s behavior  gender expression  etc  or act like you be sorry for how your child be make them feel  Equipping Your Child Work with your child on have a toolbox of response  both verbal and behavioral  to tease  You can write these down and put them in an actual box your child can revisit from time to time  Or  make a list you can review in the car on the way to school  Verbal response be best use in regard to child your child considers to be a friend  \u201c That hurt my feeling \u201d  \u201c Please don \u2019 t say that \u201d  \u201c Please stop \u201d  etc   Saying these verbal response to child who be not your child \u2019 s friend  or who be mean to your child on a consistent basis  may open your child up to more teasing   Practice assertiveness skill  Chin up  eye contact  shoulder back  look strong  Facing the person they be talk

of not \u201c fight back \u201d with their own mean word  Ignore  Act a though the other child be invisible  Can \u2019 t see \u2018 em  can \u2019 t hear \u2018 em  Walk away  Move to another area of the playground  Approach another group of kid or another kid who be typically friendly  Stay in adult eyesight or earshot  Kids aren \u2019 t go to relentlessly tease or bully other kid who be near an
