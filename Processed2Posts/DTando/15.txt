recognize a transgender child be whether or not they have be \u201c persistent and consistent \u201d in their crossgender identification  This mean the child have show a consistent  \u201c of a person  behavior  or process unchanging in achievement or effect over a period of time \u201d  identification with the brain gender of that of the \u201c opposite \u201d gender than which they be assign at birth  and that this have persist \u201c continue to exist or endure over a prolonged period \u201d  This be in regard to not just gender expression and interest  but in how they relate to themselves or identify in term of gender  More recently  I have hear \u201c insistent \u201d add on to further qualify how a transgender child will likely present  I have to say  I don \u2019 t agree with this one be one of the characteristic a parent or professional might look for in term of clarification  I think if one be look for all three of these characteristic  they might miss something  I think the level of insistence display by the child be largely dependent upon the child \u2019 s temperament  Not all transgender child will be insistent about their \u201c true \u201d gender identity  Really  if take all different temperament into consideration  we may want to also reconsider our think about the use of the word \u201c persistent \u201d when it come to transgender child a well  Another definition for persistent be \u201c continue firmly or obstinately in a course of action in spite of difficulty or opposition \u201d  Will all transgender child be persistent in this way or insistent in the face of opposition or redirection from parent or other significant figure in their life  Likely not  Just like everything  one \u2019 s personality and desire to please guardian be on a spectrum  MANY child be not insistent about anything  so they sure a heck aren \u2019 t go to be about their gender identity or desire to be recognize a a different gender than their assigned gender at birth  Some child eat their vegetable simply because they be tell to  Others refuse to take even a bite despite any tactic use by those in charge of feed them  Such be the same with gender identity  if a child be consciously aware of identify with a gender other than that assign to them at birth  ie  a natal female feel like a boy or a natal male feel like a girl   how much they express this will depend upon the level of distress it bring to them as well a their temperament  Some child will scream  \u201c I be a   \u201d and insist upon wear what they want  be refer to a they want  etc  until everyone around them be quite clear of who they really be  Others  if tell the way they feel or how they perform gender be wrong or unexpected  will quickly make modification to please those around them  When consider persistency and consistency  this be typically in regard to crossgender identification and gender expression  This may include way of dress  interest  how the child seem to categorize themselves  in play  role  or how they relate to others   gender of friend  bathroom behavior  etc  If these thing seem to be an expression of \u201c crossgender \u201d identification  that may be a sign of have a gender identity that do not match one \u2019 s birth sex  However  the individual  a child  teen  or adult  may not be consciously aware of be transgender until much later  Transgender people become consciously aware of be so at various age and stage  some seem to know since birth  others a child  others as soon a puberty hit  still others only in late teen or adulthood  I think this largely depend on how much the individual have be expose to knowledge of variation of gender  family environment  how freely one be allow to express self in regard to gender  defense  suppression  the list go on and on  Only once the individual be consciously aware of be transgender do transition become a factor  From the child who insist on his or her true gender since the time they could speak to the adult who do not become consciously aware until much later  both be equally transgender  the age of conscious awareness be simply different  If the child be yet to be consciously aware that they have the brain gender identity of something other than their assigned birth sex  there be nothing to be insistent about  The point of my post  Don \u2019 t wait for your child to insist that he or she be transgender or need to transition in order to open up the line of communication  Ask a lot of question about how your child be feel  If you sense gender be a source of internal conflict or stress  make it know it be a topic that be welcome in your home  Ask creative question to find out how your child experience his or her gender  Be honest about option that be available in regard to transition   Doing so will not make your child transgender or \u201c plant \u201d idea in their head  Transition be not an appealing option for nontransgender child   If you still sense distress but they be not be open about their feeling  seek a consultation with a gender therapist train in interview child  The benefit of early intervention  and transition if right for the child   be many  If you be transgender  look back to yourself a a child  How consistently do you express a crossgender identification  How long do this persist before you transition  Were you insistent about it  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
