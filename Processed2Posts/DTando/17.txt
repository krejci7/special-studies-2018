time of year\u2026 school be start or be about to start  If you have a transgender child or teen  it \u2019 s time to be discuss with the school what name and gender marker be go to be on the roster  computer system  and \u201c Power School \u201d field if the school use it  Only those close to transgender child and teen realize the distress that have their birth name andor gender marker on school paperwork can cause  I \u2019 ve see the panic in their eye firsthand  They be often petrify of have their peer learn their birth name  They be worried about be \u201c out \u201d  Every time they log into the computer system at school  every time attendance be call  especially in the beginning of school or by every single substitute teacher   every time a schedule or report card be pass out  even sometimes buy lunch and have their birth name and gender pop up on the computer let them into the cafeteria\u2026 I can only imagine the tension and anxiety every single one of these instance bring up for them  This be an unnecessary stressor for these kid and we all need to do our part to be educate and speak up about this issue  The following be an excerpt from Guidance for Massachusetts Public Schools  Creating a Safe and Supportive School Environment  Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity  \u201c The 2011 National School Climate Survey by the Gay  Lesbian  Straight Education Network  GLSEN   find that 754  of transgender student have be verbally harass in the previous year  321  have be physically harass  and 168  have be physically assault  Educators play an essential role in advocate for the wellbeing of these student and create a school culture that support them \u201d I believe change the documentation that circulate around school and on attendance roster be a crucial part of create a school culture that support transgender and gender nonconforming youth  I recently learn at the Gender Spectrum conference that the school be only legally require to keep the legal birth name and gender marker somewhere in the permanent file  but they can change EVERYTHING ELSE to the preferred name and gender before a legal change  Before spread the word  I do a little research on this topic to back up this claim  The following quote be from the California Safe Schools Coalition Model School District Policy Regarding Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Students  \u201c Official Records The District be require to maintain a mandatory permanent pupil record  \u201c official record \u201d  that include a student \u2019 s legal name and legal gender  However  the District be not require to use a student \u2019 s legal name and gender on other school record or document  The District will change a student \u2019 s official record to reflect a change in legal name or legal gender upon receipt of documentation that such change have be make pursuant to a court order  In situation where school staff or administrator be require by law to use or to report a transgender student \u2019 s legal name or gender  such a for purpose of standardized testing  school staff and administrator shall adopt practice to avoid the inadvertent disclosure of such confidential information  NamesPronouns A student have the right to be address by a name and pronoun that correspond to the student \u2019 s gender identity  A courtordered name or gender change be not require  and the student need not change his or her official record  The intentional or persistent refusal to respect a student \u2019 s gender identity  for example  intentionally refer to the student by a name or pronoun that do not correspond to the student \u2019 s gender identity  be a violation of this policy \u201d The follow be excerpt from California School Boards Association  CSBA  \u2019 s \u201c Final Guidance  AB1266  Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Students  Privacy  Programs  Activities and Facilities \u201c  \u201c Upon request  district should prepare data system to list a transgender or gender nonconforming student by his or her preferred name and gender \u201d \u201c Privacy Rights of Transgender or Gender Nonconforming Student A student \u2019 s decision to inform the district that his or her gender identity differs from his or her biological gender be extremely personal and private  In addition  transgender and gender nonconforming student may face bullying and harassment a a result of other student or staff not understanding or tolerate the public representation of their gender identity  At the same time  the decision may potentially involve very public component if  for example  the student start to go by a different name  Despite this potential for public awareness  district be still legally responsible to maintain the student privacy accord to the student wishes \u201d The following be an excerpt from Know Your Rights \u2013 Transgender People and the Law  Name Change and Identity Documents  \u201c Can a person change his or her name to reflect his or her gender identity  Yes  In some state  and California be one of those state   through what be call \u201c common law name change  \u201d people may change their name simply by
