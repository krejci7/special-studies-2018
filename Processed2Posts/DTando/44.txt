a simple fact about the general population and their understanding of transgender individual  some get it  and some don \u2019 t  I don \u2019 t know what the common denominator be in those who \u201c get it \u201d  or those who don \u2019 t  I just know there be a pretty clear delineation of these two camp  I also know that there be one thing that set me up well to go into this particular niche\u2026 I just \u201c get it \u201d  I don \u2019 t think that make me good than people who don \u2019 t get it  there be no judgment there  I see it a a piece that be simply a part of some people  and not a part of others  For me  I \u201c get it \u201d first and then be educate on all the intricacy of gender identity and work with gender dysphoric individual  Others  I suppose  may need to be educate first before they \u201c get it \u201d  The great news be that even those who initially don \u2019 t \u201c get it \u201d can come to understand and accept over time  Others still may never really understand  but can be love and accept about it anyway  There be a lot of factor that impact how others receive the news that a loved one be transgender  One of the big obstacle be a lack of knowledge  Many people have never have any experience with know someone who be transgender and simply don \u2019 t know anything about it  When there be a void of knowledge  a plethora of opinion  guess  and myth can take it place  all of which can contribute to a difficult response or a difficult processing of the news  Many people have misconception and preconceived notion  Some have hear misinformation about transgender people  others have hear a little true information and then \u201c fill in the blank \u201d with assumption that may be fuel by fear or stigma  Having certain feeling about the issue can also fuel the guess  Having preexisting negative feeling about transgender people will breed negative guess  take the place of fact or reality  Add worry and concern for the loved one who be transgender  and the result be a pretty tricky response to the to the big revelation  If you be a transgender individual who be \u201c come out \u201d to someone you care very much about and you value the relationship with this person  it be a good idea to provide information from the start or steer them in the right direction of where to find information  There be a lot of resource out there for love one  Additionally  take the time to explain your journey to selfrealization of your true gender identity  and all the feeling  both positive and negative  that go with it may be just the information another need to \u201c get it \u201d  You may feel exhausted and deplete by have already go through a long and difficult internal journey to get to where you be  but take the time to share this with your loved one could go a long way  Yet even when information be provide  many still do not \u201c get it \u201d  Some simply can not wrap their brain around the concept  There \u2019 s a difference between have informationknowledge and \u201c get it \u201d  \u201c Getting it \u201d take some ability to see the gray area about thing  and understand that gender be not black and white  Some people have difficulty see thing in anything other than black and white  There could also be a variety of other thing that contribute to one \u2019 s ability to \u201c get it \u201d  Personal experience  background  basic tolerance for those who be different  religion  empathy  the ability to see life from another \u2019 s point of view  etc  Some be stick in their own experience  some be stick in the gender dichotomy  some can only see what be concrete  How much energy should be put into try to make them \u201c get it \u201d  After make a reasonable effort to explain yourself or the basic concept of be transgender  provide resource  etc  there be a necessary boundary that need to be set  Doing this too much can be deplete for the trans person who have multiple other demand in which to put their energy  It \u2019 s also important to allow others the space to come around on their own   you have likely be down a similar journey of doubt  fear  and eventually acceptance  and accept the possibility that it may not happen  In those case where your love one doesn \u2019 t seem to understand after a lot of explain and resource give  tell them you love them ask for what you would like from them in regard to your transition  If they love you  operate from a stance of love and compassion can go a long way even if one doesn \u2019 t \u201c get it \u201d  I \u2019 ve be contemplate what the ratio of \u201c get it \u201d to \u201c don \u2019 t get it \u201d might be\u2026 To transgender individual out there  what ratio of people in your life \u201c get it \u201d vs those who don \u2019 t  ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
