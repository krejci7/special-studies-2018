one be their gender identity  and the other be what they be go to do about it  One be who you ARE  the other be what you DO  A woman I be speak with recently make reference to a transgender acquaintance of hers  \u201c He be in the process of become transgender \u201d \u201c Transitioning \u201d  I say  \u201c What  \u201d she ask  \u201c Transitioning be the process \u201d  I say  \u201c Being transgender be who he is \u201d One do not \u201c become \u201d transgender  One be bear transgender  What one eventually do with that be an entirely different issue  and be different for every individual  Understanding  knowing  discover  realize one \u2019 s gender identity be a unique process for everyone  Some people understand what gender they be from the very start  never think about it  and never have to worry about it  not even once in their entire life  These people be usually those whose biological sex match the gender of their brain  For transgender individual  come to understand their personal gender can look many different way  Some have an immediate sense of identify a the \u201c opposite \u201d gender  forgive my reference to the gender dichotomy   and depend on temperament  family influence  etc  that awareness can cause very different level of distress in the individual  Some be vocal about it  since childhood  Some guard it like a secret  Some don \u2019 t really know exactly what \u2019 s go on  but they have a sense there be something not quite right  Some individual don \u2019 t realize their gender doesn \u2019 t match their biological sex until they be much old  but when they do  a lot of piece fall into place   Having a child or family member not realize until they be much old be often more difficult for the family member  but that \u2019 s a subject for another blog   By the time a client make it to my office  he or she be usually pretty darn sure about his or her gender identity  In fact  MOST transgender client I come into contact with be completely sure of what gender they be  I have be know to facetiously say  \u201c that \u2019 s the easy part  \u201d  After understand and come to peace with one \u2019 s gender identity  the next task be decide what he or she be go to DO about it  For those of you not completely savvy with all the concept and term  the process of align one \u2019 s biological sex with one \u2019 s gender identity be call \u201c transitioning \u201d  Mainly this include change one \u2019 s appearance  name  and pronoun to \u201c present \u201d a the gender with which he or she identify  It often include hormone and sometimes include surgery  This be the hard part  Much of the agony for my client come from not try to figure out what gender they be  but what they be go to do about it  Transitioning from one gender to the other  and cop with all that entail  be a very scary thing  Some client will come say they identify a \u201c third gender \u201d or something in the middle   Of course  some people really feel this way  and they refer to themselves a genderqueer  In this blog I \u2019 m discuss those who ultimately identify a transgender   What usually cause someone who be transgender to say this be the fear of the transition  In this case it be the \u201c what to do \u201d wreak havoc on the \u201c who I be \u201d  In my experience with my client  fear of transition mainly come from outside source  They may fear the reaction of significant others  family member  coworker  or society at large  If the fear of this remain great than the desire to make themselves happy by align their body with their mind  the transgender person may decide not to pursue transition  This do not make the person any less transgender  It just mean too much get in the way of do what they need to do for themselves  to make themselves happy  Having a transgender person decide not to transition be not cause for a sigh of relief  it be often cause for concern  Not transition due to fear of reaction or to please others may be the recipe for an unhappy future  For some  decide to transition be easy  even if the process be still a challenge one  Once their gender identity be realize  transition to match their body and out appearance be a natural next step  For many transgender individual  transitioning be a very positive process  one that bring much relief  joy  and satisfaction  It \u2019 s my wish that over time  with an increase understanding of what it mean to be transgender and extensive depathologizing of the concept  the gap between who someone be and what he or she be go to do about it will become much  much small  To my transgender friend  client  and blog follower  I \u2019 d love to hear your feedback about this  Either comment on this blog or email me privately  Thanks a always for reading  ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Gender Blog by Darlene Tando, LCSW"}
