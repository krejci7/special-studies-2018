Airplane", "lesbian", "queer", "top surgery", "transgender", "Transition"], "text": "One side of the mushroom will make you larger\u2026but which side  It be a parlor game  If you could swallow a pill that would change your body shape into whatever form you wish  what would you wish for and would you swallow the pill  My first reaction be I \u2019 d like to be a few inch taller  5 \u2019 7 instead of 5 \u2019 4  and have a masculinize chest  ie  top surgery   My second reaction be whoa slow down and think this through  I \u2019 m good at procrastinate  I can wait until I be clear about what I want to do  or until I have no choice but to take action  I promise Donna that I if I be go to have top surgery  I would wait until she be ready  I be still wait  neither of u be ready  When I first start to think about what it mean to be transgender  I be both intrigue by and repel by top surgery  I be still ambivalent  I \u2019 ve try to write post before about top surgery  but they have not felt right  This be yet another attempt  If the thought of a butch  or me in particular  consider top surgery creep you out  stop here and read another post  Otherwise  continue down into the rabbit hole  From the time I first recognize myself in the mirror I have be gender dysphoric  I \u2019 ve manage it since kindergarten by have short hair and wear boy \u2019 s and then men \u2019 s clothes  I \u2019 ve manage it by be visibly queer and butch  Some day I do good than others  When I lose weight  my dysphoria shift to my chest  My breast be more visible  or seem more visible to me  For psychological comfort  not physical comfort  I \u2019 ve be wear a compression sport bra or a binder  I like the flat look  but my body be not naturally flat  I wish I have a flat chest  If you offer me the pill  I \u2019 d take it  I \u2019 m not so sure about anesthesia and the knife  I \u2019 ve have four surgery between my knee and my uterus  I put off a partial hysterectomy for as long a possible  In retrospect  delaying be a mistake  I believe in natural menopause  I think I could handle the anemia and hemorrhage from the fibroid  I felt immediately well after the surgery  after I recover from the anesthesia  and be ecstatic to never have my period again  I be not aware of how dysphoric I be about menstruation until it stop  There be no way to know how I would feel about have top surgery  Would I wonder why I wait or would I think that nothing really change except for the size of my chest  Below be some of the argument against top surgery that have I have hear and consider  Some be transphobic  ie  they deny the validity of a transgender identity   Even if your breast make you uncomfortable you should keep them because they be a part of you  Do the best you can with what you \u2019 ve get  You be strong and you can deal with the dysphoria  You think your dysphoria be about your breast  but if you have top surgery it could resurface attach to another body part  Think of all the starve child and ask yourself if it be right to spend the money on cut off your breast  You do not need medical intervention to be transgender  It be just a phase you be go through  If you wait it out it may pass  You be perfect just the way you be  This be the other side  There be no butch narrative or transgender narrative that you need to hew to  Having top surgery do not make you less butch or more transgender than you be now  Dysphoria be a horrible thing to deal with day in and day out  If top surgery would lessen your dysphoria then you should consider it  Binding or wear a sport bra be not comfortable  do you really want to do that for the rest of your life  You do have privilege and money  If you feel guilty about it donate your time or money to a worthy cause  It have nothing to do with top surgery  Trust your self to make the right decision  you will know when and if you be ready  I \u2019 ve spend some time on You Tube  Transbucket  and Tumblr  I \u2019 ve look at a lot of graphic depiction of top surgery  I don \u2019 t have a clear vision of what I want my chest to look like  I \u2019 ve read and reread Micah \u2019 s top surgery post on Neutrois Nonsense  I \u2019 ve research a few surgeon  but haven \u2019 t find anyone in the New York metropolitan area who come highly recommended  Taub or Weiss   The lazy New York chauvinist in me be hesitant to travel to Chicago  Steinwald  or Cleveland  Medalie   I don \u2019 t have a plan  Deciding whether or not to get top surgery be not a parlor game  It be serious  The more time I spend think about it  the more accustomed to the idea I get  The less appalling it seem  It start to sound like a rational solution to an irrational problem  I can either compressbind or I can have surgery  there be no go back to how it be before  There be no magic pill  Note  The post title be from the Jefferson Airplane \u2018 s song \u201c White Rabbit \u201c  The song be base on Lewis Carroll \u2019 s \u201c Alice \u2019 s Adventures in Wonderland \u201d  illustrate by John Tenniel  The text and drawing be in the public domain and available through Project Gutenberg  Growing up  I do not like the book  I only like book about boy   but I reread it in college  I want to understand the reference in the song  ", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
