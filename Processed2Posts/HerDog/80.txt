ve attach my contact information and a current photo for your casting manager  I \u2019 m also post the cast call on my blog  I take the liberty of websearching your company to get more information on the project  I be surprise to see that some of the other episode in the 21 Day Myth series consist of Move Into a Tiny House  Is Your Sex Life Too Vanilla  and Do You Want to Look Like Barbie  I also read up on the 21 Day Myth  a theory erroneously base on \u201c Psychocybernetics \u201d publish by Dr Maxwell Maltz in 1960  Dr Maltz state that it take 21 day to get use to a change  eg  move into a new apartment or adjust to plastic surgery result  This somehow morph out of control into 21 day to adopt a new habit or make a major change in your life  It take me about three week to get use to myself in my new eyeglass  Transitioning be not something anyone should do lightly or under time pressure  Each person need to determine their own timeline for transition  without a gatekeeper make them prove that they deserve access to service  hormone  or surgery  My trans journey be a set at a slow pace  From the moment that I tell my therapist \u201c I \u2019 m not a girl \u201d it take me six month to take my next step and choose my name  I wait another six month before I ask my partner  my friend  and my coworker to use my real  and legal  name  I don \u2019 t think I \u2019 ve make any trans decision in a 21 day window  and wouldn \u2019 t encourage anyone else to do anything before they be ready  I think it be important to have accurate and diverse example of transmasculine people in the medium  I hope your project will treat the participate individual with respect and not sensationalize their story  Looking forward to hear back from you  Jamie Rachel \u2019 s original email to me  include the casting call  be in the Notes section  I don \u2019 t expect that I will be cast a a mentor in this show  although I think I would be a good peer listener  I \u2019 m not a stereotypical trans man  I \u2019 m not sure I \u2019 m \u201c trans enough \u201d for their purpose  I can \u2019 t even make a firm decision about the path of my own transition or pick a label for myself  I \u2019 m not photogenic  I \u2019 m just a middleaged  middleclass  butch  transgender  blogging fool  I receive Rachel \u2019 s email the day after I watch the Bruce Jenner interview  For a medium circus event I think the program be respectful  touching  and remarkably boring  I do think about what I would say if I be in Bruce \u2019 s place  but I \u2019 m not in Bruce \u2019 s place  I \u2019 m in Jamie \u2019 s place  and this be where I get to tell my story  to 169 million few people   Notes  This be a good debunking of the 21 Day Myth from The Health Behaviour Research Centre at
