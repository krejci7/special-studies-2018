trap inside an apple  Or maybe you feel like a cranapple  or  a auto correct would insinuate  like a crabapple   Thanksgiving can be a tough time for US fruit like u  transgender  butch  queer  or otherwise gender nonconforming   The ramp up to the holiday be packed full of image of heteronormative family in joyous and loving celebration  The woman be work in the kitchen  the men be in the den watching football  and a wellbehaved dog be peacefully snoozing by the fireplace  It be a constant reminder of how I don \u2019 t fit in  and why I don \u2019 t want to fit it  And that I be estrange from my birth family  It end with Thanksgiving  When Donna and I start our relationship  my mother would not invite her over  She be try to keep my grandmother from \u201c knowing \u201d We be suppose to be one small normal happy family  The main source of happiness in my life be  and still be  Donna  Back then  I didn \u2019 t have a dog  but my mother would not have allow me to bring the dog either  I wouldn \u2019 t go to Thanksgiving without Donna  I hop my refusal would pressure my mother into cough up an invitation  It didn \u2019 t  We table hop for a few year  but I wouldn \u2019 t go home  When Donna and I move in together we decide to make Thanksgiving dinner in our home  We invite some friend over  Twenty year later  we be still cook for the same crowd  My grandmother and my mother be both dead  stack one on top of the other in a mausoleum in Westchester  I spend a lot of time in November think about the meal  Donna and I collaborate  negotiate  on which dish to rotate in or out  We each have our favorite  it be too much work and too much food on the table to make all of them each year  But there be always two cranberry sauce  Donna like the traditional sauce  and I like one that be all mixed up and savory  There be no acceptable compromise  I use to make a different savory sauce each year  A cranberry chutney with fresh and candied ginger  onion raisin cranberry confit  a cranberry salsa with cilantro and poblano pepper  Two year ago I sample a spiced cranberry apple sauce at the Greenmarket and think \u201c I could reproduce this \u201d It take three try to get it right  but it be good  So good that It find it place in the Thanksgiving canon  and can not be swap out  This year the experimentation have shift to the \u201c onion dish \u201d  November mean try out some new recipe  sweet and sour onion  and tweak old one  jeweled roast vegetable   The dish must be able to be make ahead of time and taste good serve at room temperature or reheat with everything else after the turkey come out of the oven  I \u2019 ve still get a week leave to play  Because I write about what be on my mind  I offer you these two recipe  Cis Cranberry Sauce for Donna

history of how \u201c fruit \u201d become slang for gay  Instead  I turn up this bizarre clip from the CBC on how the Mounties try to use a \u201c fruit machine \u201d to identify gay men during the early 1960 \u2019 s  ", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
