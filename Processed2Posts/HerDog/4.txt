Village Peace Center  1968  Grace be in the middle  I \u2019 ve only have a few positive role model in my life  Most of my role model be negative role model  I didn \u2019 t want to be like my mother  I didn \u2019 t want to be like my grandmother  It wasn \u2019 t only a lack of positive female role model  Even though I want to be a boy  I didn \u2019 t want to be like my brother or my father  There be so many people I didn \u2019 t want to be like  I saw  and experience  their character flaw  Short temper  Manipulative  Critical  Stingy  Greedy  Arbitrary  Narcissistic  Powerless  Resentful  I swear that when I grow up I would do good  I would not repeat their mistake  My early exposure to teacher  other kid \u2019 s parent  school psychologist  and librarian do not improve my attitude towards adult  I think adult be boring  tedious  and rigid  They all insist that I act like a girl  It wasn \u2019 t until I come out  and start do political work  that I meet old adult whom I could relate to  They be nonconformists  I saw their flaw  but I also saw their strength  I might not want to be just like them  but I definitely want to pick and choose from some of their character trait  I admire the serious calm anger of the pacifist at demonstration  How they would walk right up to a line of riot police and then sit down  without flinching  without show fear  At demonstration they take to the street and block traffic a if it be the most natural thing in the world  I admire their clarity and how their action be consistent with their belief  I study the history of nonviolence  I read Gandhi  Dr King  and Barbara Demming  Some of it rub off on me  I feel like I \u2019 ve be angry my whole life  When I \u2019 m out protest  I have trouble hold onto two of the basic principle of nonviolence  that nonviolence seek to defeat injustice not people  and that nonviolence resists violence of the spirit as well a the body  I have to keep remind myself that there be no point in hating  have contempt for  or humiliate people I disagree with  This include people who be proTrump and antigayantitrans  It do not feel good to hate  It do not move my cause forward  It do not help them see me a an individual  When Donna be at a demonstration  she often ask herself \u201c What would Grace Paley do  \u201d Donna be friend with Grace  they know each other through the peace movement  I be initially intimidate by Grace because she be a famous writer  and because she look like  and sound like  a Jewish grandmother  She didn \u2019 t act like one  Grace speak what be on her mind  but she do it without lose her temper  Grace talk  in a friendly manner  to everyone and anyone at a demonstration  include the police  counterprotestors  and hostile bystander  She could turn shout match into conversation  If a man tell Grace to \u201c Go back to Russia  \u201d she \u2019 d start off her reply with \u201c My father be bear in Russia  and come here for a good life\u2026 \u201d Grace would find a way to talk to her adversary  at length  I \u2019 ve lose it at demonstration when I be heckle by someone who disagree with me  Each time it catch me by surprise  All it take be for them to tell me they hop I die from AIDS  or to call me a fing dyke  If a man tell me to \u201c Go back to Russia  \u201d I \u2019 d probably tell him to crawl back into his cave  Last week there be thirty of u protest outside of Trump Tower and five proTrump counterprotesters approach u  They try to provoke u by walk in front our group and block our sign with their sign  They be look to start a fight  At first I resist ask myself \u201c What would Grace do  \u201d I didn \u2019 t want to channel a Jewish grandmother  even if it be Grace  even if she be right  I didn \u2019 t want to do anything that might look too accommodating  but I also didn \u2019 t want our group to get into a fight with them  I introduce myself to their leader  and I politely  but firmly  ask them to move to the edge of our demonstration  I tell them that we would respect their sign and message if they respect ours  and that there be enough room on the street for both group  Part of me want to rip their sign out of their hand  Part of me want to call them Neanderthal Nazi \u2019 s  There be another part of me that want to see if I could get them to move by be neutral  or open  Denied an opportunity to fight  they acquiesce  and move away  while the spirit of Grace watch over u  Notes  This be a link to a short piece that Grace write about demonstrating  http  booksgooglecombooks
