This year I \u2019 m swimming genderqueer  This year I be put together  a Donna refer to it  a cockamamie swim outfit  Without the cock  I \u2019 m only entertain swimsuit that appeal to my masculine side  Everyone have an idealized version of what they want to look like on the beach  I have mine  Even if the style be 100 year old  Even if the original be make out of wool jersey  and the style be discard when swimsuit start to be manufacture from modern material  Swimsuit style haven \u2019 t change that much in the past 70 year  Men have be wear trunk since the 1930 \u2019 s  the bikini be

of u  me  Donna  and Gracie   We will be stay near the beach in a small dogfriendly cottage colony  If I \u2019 m not comfortable on the beach I \u2019 ll be spend a lot of time in the communal garden reading with Gracie  Sometimes a hat be just a hat  Getty Images  The beach on Cape Ann have rule  No dog  no alcohol  no bon fire  no camping  no nude sunbathing  I \u2019 ve never see a woman go topless there  not even face down on her own towel  It isn \u2019 t Europe  Men and woman be suppose to be equal under the law  The law should not be base on a straight male eroticization of woman \u2019 s body  I \u2019 m for nipple equality  and not just because I have top surgery  my surgeon tell me to keep my scar cover this summer   I \u2019 d like to feel the sun on my chest  This year a rash guard  Next year we will see  Notes  Lots of note this week  An interesting article on nipple equality from The Atlantic  If you be interested in a picture history of swimsuit  Weathercom have a great slide show  If you be interested in the homoerotic history of nude bathing  health  and nude swimming  sport  this website have a ton of information  don \u2019 t miss the Life magazine section on boy swim in the nude  It come from a lengthy jingoist article on democracy in school  Danae be base in Amsterdam  they specialize in binder and swimsuit for trans and gender nonconforming people  I buy a regular binder  a swimming binder  and swim bottom from them  The binder be too tight  I never like any binder except for velcro one   The swimming binder have too much compression \u2013 the compression fabric go to the bottom of the shirt and I couldn \u2019 t sit due to the pressure on my stomach  this be a theme   The short be great  and have a little pocket for a packer   I try to cut out the back compression panel in the swim top and butcher it \u2013 my fault  Danae be willing to make swim top with compression only in the front  or no compression at all  They be very nice  respond to email promptly  and ship fast consider they be in Amsterdam  I highly recommend them  Outplay be a lesbian own company  base in Miami  with less of a track record  They make board short  swim top  and swim short that I would wear  They be try hard  but they don \u2019 t have a lot in stock  and it can take a long time to process order  They offer a high and a low compression swim top  low work for me  and they say they be go to make a no compression swim top  which would be ideal  Their sizing be initially off  and I have to exchange stuff several time  It all get straighten out  but it be frustrate \u2013 by the time they send me the low compression top I have miss the summer and I be a week away from top surgery  I hope they make it  but be forewarn that it be not like shop at Zappos  This be my third swimsuit post  I \u2019 m not sure I \u2019 m make much progress  My 2013 swimsuit post be here  My 2014 swimsuit post be there  ", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013 A Boy and
