Didrikson  demonstrate her hurdling technique  1932  In July  after my intake appointment at CallenLorde  NYC \u2019 s LGBT health clinic   my nurse practitioner tell me that my cholesterol be high  I need to lower it before I consider start testosterone  I buy a bottle of fish oil  I carry a card in my wallet  with the name of a prominent cardiologist on it  for three month  When I call  the office manager tell me that I can \u2019 t schedule an appointment until the cardiologist look at my file  She give me her name and the fax number  which I write down on the back of an envelope  The next day  I pull up the CallenLorde patient portal expect to send my result over  I attempt to log in  I try every permutation of my user IDs and password  I phone CallenLorde  and they realize that when they initially register me they incorrectly enter my email address in my profile  which explain why I never get any email from them   I drop by their office to straighten it out and reregister  I go home  set up the user name and password  write the password down on the patient portal information sheet  open up my file to get my result  and couldn \u2019 t find them  I click around a lot and give up  I be go to call CallenLorde back and ask where to find my test result  but it be late in the day and the medical record office be close  I have to wait until the morning  I think about call CallenLorde every day  but there be always an excuse to put it off  I wait for a month  I dread make phone call  I \u2019 m also not very good at fill out paper form and send them in  I \u2019 m well on email  I \u2019 ve be this way since I be a teenager  I \u2019 d rather scale a barbed wire fence than make a phone call  First  I need to find the cardiologist \u2019 s card  which be no longer in my wallet  and the envelope on which I have write the information  I find them bury under a month \u2019 s worth of halfopened mail  Then I unsuccessfully try to reopen the CallenLorde patient portal  I go back through the pile and find the piece of paper upon which I have scrawl my user name and password  I open up the portal  and pick up my phone  It be all my mother \u2019 s fault  Negative and narcissistic  she expect people to be unhelpful or obstructionist  She think everyone else get well treatment than she do  She felt slight by every interaction  She believe that thing go smoothly for other people  rich people  people with connection  big shot  In college  when I get shut out of a class I want to take  I accept it a fate and register for a different  undersubscribed  class  There be other kid who argue with the registrar  or plead with the professor directly for permission to take the class  or beg their academic advisor to call on their behalf  They didn \u2019 t give up  They felt entitle to get into the class  and they probably do get in  According to Malcolm Gladwell  in Outliers  those kid be likely raise by a parent who uphold their selfworth  teach them how to negotiate with people in authority  and encourage them to advocate on their own behalf  These be useful skill if you be transition and deal with gatekeeper  insurance company  and medical practitioner  I \u2019 m not good with the follow through  I get discourage  I call CallenLorde  They confirm that the result be not in my patient portal  I need to fill out a Health Information Release Form  and request them to send my result to the cardiologist  The form be on the patient portal  all I need to do be find it  download it  fill it out  sign it  and fax it back to them  It might take them a week to send out the result  It sound reasonable  I print the form and fill it out  twice  I screw it up the first time   I get hung up on the fax it back part  I didn \u2019 t ask why I couldn \u2019 t email it to them  or if there be an easy or faster way to deal with it  I don \u2019 t have a land line or a home fax  When I \u2019 ve have to fax something I \u2019 ve use the fax at my office  but I only go in once a week  I didn \u2019 t want to find a copy shop and pay to fax  I google \u201c fax via internet for free \u201d  read a couple of howto article  pick out a free service  and subscribe  I scan my document  rename it  fill out the fax form on MyFax  attach the document  and send it  I call to confirm that they get it  It be exhaust  I still have two phone call leave to place  one to CallenLorde to check if they send it  and one to the cardiologist \u2019 s office manager to make sure she get it  And then  maybe  I \u2019 ll get the appointment  Notes  Outliers be the third book of Malcolm Gladwell \u2019 s that I \u2019 ve read  I highly recommend both The Tipping Point and Blink   While it be do not directly address any LGBT issue  it make me think about why some of u have a lot of trouble deal with bureaucracy  while others seem to sail right along  Still  I be in awe of those who be wellorganized  keep track of where their paperwork be  and don \u2019 t procrastinate  ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
