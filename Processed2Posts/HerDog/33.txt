park it on the street  In Manhattan  Last year someone key a big scratch in the passenger side door  maybe they didn \u2019 t like our bumper sticker    It have a lot of park ding  I \u2019 m good at find park space  but not so good at fit in them  I \u2019 m also responsible for bring the car in for routine maintenance  and keep the insurance  registration  and inspection up to date  I don \u2019 t know much about car  I grow up in the city and my parent never own a car  A couple of time a year  if we be come home late at night  my parent would splurge on a taxi  Mostly  we take the bus  or stay in our neighborhood  I think people who keep a car in the city be crazy  Then Donna inherit a little money from her father and use it to buy a house in the country  We get a car  I learn to drive in my thirty  Friday afternoon  I pack up enough food for a long weekend upstate and leave the bag in the lobby of our apartment building  I take Gracie for a walk  and then we go to pick up the car  where I have park it the day before after the street sweeper go by   I put Gracie in the back  slide into the driver \u2019 s seat  and put the key in the ignition  The dashboard light and the radio come on  but the car would not start  My brother know about as much about car a I do  His cop mechanism be to buy a shiny new Lexus SUV every three year  I wish we have grow up around car  I wish our Dad could have teach u how to listen to a car  how to parallel park  and how to merge into oncoming traffic safely  I wish I could have call that Dad on Friday  Instead  I call the auto repair shop I get my inspection sticker from  They say it could be the ignition switch  the starter  or the fuel pump  They tell me to call AAA and get a tow  After I assure AAA that I be stick in a safe  albeit tight  parking spot  they tell me it would be about an hour  Gracie and I wait  I call Donna and tell her to bring the grocery back upstairs and put them away  Exactly an hour later  a small AAA SUV arrive and a slight goateed guy in his twenty hop out and ask me to pop open the hood of my car  I draw a blank  I couldn \u2019 t remember where the hood release lever be  I would have let Mr AAA find it but Gracie be jump up and down  barking  and bear her teeth  I finally find it on the left side under the dashboard  I think \u201c If I be a real guy I would have handle this better \u201d Mr AAA take a look  tell me it be probably time for a new battery  and give me a jumpstart  I turn the key  and the engine start up  Emergency over  He tell me to keep the engine run for a half hour to hold the charge  I thank him  I call Donna  she repacked the food  and we drive off  I felt like an idiot  The truth be that if I be a guy  at least one who grow up in my family  I would have have the exact same problem  My battery didn \u2019 t fail because I be assign female at birth  Car knowledge doesn \u2019 t automatically come with the testosterone or from be butch  it come from experience and grow up in a car culture  I win \u2019 t forget where the hood release be or that a battery can be low enough to keep the headlight and radio on but not start the engine  In the last twelve month I \u2019 ve pay for spark plug  new tire  a wheel alignment  new brake pad  a new gas cap  and new strut  The car be only worth between  4000 and  5000  A new battery win \u2019 t cost more than  150  but I \u2019 m start to think about when it will make financial sense to buy another car  I \u2019 d like to milk a few more year out of this one  The guy at work tell me it be time to trade up  That I be well than a tenyear old Subaru  They tell me that it be a good starter car  this be actually my second Subaru   but I deserve something flashy  They suggest car that be sporty  BMW   or luxurious  Audi   or fun  Corvette   When the time come  I \u2019 ll probably replace it with another sturdy  sober  utilitarian  reliable Subaru  For all my identity issue  I don \u2019 t identify with my car  or maybe I do  Notes  I like this post by Jenn Coyle \u201c You be not your car \u201d on the danger of be suck into spend more on a car than you want to  To save money  I park on the street instead of in a garage  over  600month   This mean that at least two time a week I have to move my car for alternate side of street parking  street sweep   This be a vehicular form of musical chair  where instead of run around in a circle  you wait for the Sanitation truck to go through and then parallel park a fast a you can to claim a spot  It be a not for the faint of heart  and not something I \u2019 d want to do with a brand new car  ", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 A Boy and Her Dog"}
