progress or  in some case  regress  At it heart  the MN TGirls exist a a social and support group  I want to create a group that socialize  that go out and do everyday thing  such a have a nice dinner or go to the mall  It be a group where one can feel safe when go out into the real world  Many of u felt a mixture of emotion the first  or even the fiftieth time we leave the house presenting a the gender we identify a  I know those emotion because I felt  and sometimes still do  feel them  For year I be afraid to leave the house  What be I afraid of  A million thing  Afraid of my car break down and be strand somewhere  Afraid of be recognize  afraid of be harass  threaten  laugh at  or bad  I be afraid I be not beautiful  There be a vague  unattainable goal of \u201c passing \u201d for some in our community  Passing be when we  a transwomen  be see a ciswomen  Although I can have flawless makeup and wear a beautiful dress  I still have wide shoulder  large hand and a deep voice  In short  I have many physical characteristic that be normally associate with men  Some of u want to pass because it \u2019 s validation and confirmation that our presentation be so amazing that most people would think we be bear a female  Some of u look at passing in a desire to be unrecognizable to people that we know who might see u  Some of u just want to pass because it mean we be as beautiful a the gender we identify a  But pass be unattainable and vague  and it \u2019 s unattainable because it be so vague  There be not a set of standard that one have to meet in order to be female  or to be beautiful  Yes  I be tall  I be even taller in four inch heel   and height be often view a a male characteristic and thus \u201c give me away \u201d  But I have meet ciswomen who be tall than me  I have meet ciswomen who have deep voice than myself  I have meet ciswomen with facial hair  Are they not woman because of those characteristic  What decide what be feminine  Who decide what be beauty  Who decide who be beautiful  No one  Well  you do  It \u2019 s not for anyone else to decide  Once I realize that there be no such thing a passing  that there be no standard I have to meet in order to be beautiful  then my whole world change  I be ready to go out  I be still nervous about the same thing a before  with the exception of not feel beautiful enough  Instead of strive to pass  I want to blend in  I do my best to blend in the first time I go out  which be about six year ago  I be still learn makeup but my confidence be grow with each day  I be tire of sit around my living room and be ready to get out into the real world  So  one Friday morning I wake up  do my makeup  get dress and leave the house  The photo on the left be what I wear when I go out for the first time\u2026a cute skirt  a colorful top  cardigan and black stocking  I think it be a perfect outfit for run errand  For the next few month  I pick out outfit that  in my opinion  help me blend in  Blending in  I think  be a form of protection  There be those who have a fear and hatred of people who identify a transgender  and I didn \u2019 t want to draw a lot of attention to myself  l I become a target for ridicule  violence  or bad  Blending in become a sort of camouflage  in a way  As I go out on a more regular basis  I realize that the world wasn \u2019 t as scary a I think it would be  If I be be laugh at and point towards  I didn \u2019 t notice it  People be kind to me  People compliment my outfit or the skill I have when it come to walk in heel  My confidence grow  My selfesteem grow  Blending in  in those early day  give me an opportunity to experience life as incognito a possible  consider I be a six foot tall  and taller in heel  transgirl  As my wardrobe grow  I notice the clothes I be buy be reflect my grow confidence and courage  I be buy less clothes that I felt help me blend in and more clothes that  in the corner of mind  I would wear in public when I felt bolder  It would take another year or so until the outfit I wear outside of the house move from blend in to be bolder  My wardrobe be expand and be soon fill up with bright color  bold pattern  high heel and skirt that show off all the hard work I put into on the Stairmaster at the gym  Then one day I be do blending in  I be not sure what trigger it  perhaps it be a beautiful day  or a new dress I couldn \u2019 t wait to wear  Soon I be at the mall  at the art museum  get makeover and have coffee wear dress that I never think I \u2019 d have the courage to wear in the real world  Dresses with bright pattern  eyecatching design and flower  A LOT of flower  I remember the day I wear the outfit picture above  I be feel particularly bold that afternoon and opt for a bright  tight pink dress with match pink heel  I look at myself in every mirror I saw at the mall that day and marvel how it didn \u2019 t seem that long ago when I try so hard to blend in  to not be notice  This outfit be about a far away as incognito a one could get  These day I no longer try to blend in  There \u2019 s not much in my closet that I be not comfortable wear  Of course  I still believe in dress appropriately  I be not go to wear my leather dress and five inch stiletto to the grocery store  for example  Looking back at these photo and remember the past few year  I be amaze at the confidence I \u2019 ve gain in such a short time  One of the reason I form the MN TGirls be to show other transwomen that the world can be scary at first  but it \u2019 s really quite wonderful once you be out in it  I understand the need and instinct to want to blend in  but stand out be liberate and amaze  You may be surprise by how the world react and even embrace you  There be a hashtag that I saw the other day that read  wearwhatscaresyou and I really like that idea  The idea of wear a bright pink dress with skyhigh heel terrify me a few year ago  but it \u2019 s one of my favorite outfit  To me it scream confidence  Wearing what scar you be a big step  and it take me a couple year to gain the confidence that I need to do so  But  like wear high heel  it take baby step  Getting a little push doesn \u2019 t hurt either  I remember go to Pride and have to stop at the grocery store beforehand  I be wear a bright pink  polka dot dress to the festival and walk into the store wearing such a eyecatching outfit be a little scary at first  The dress be perfect for a hot summer day at Pride  but very bold for a grocery store visit at 630am  However  do that be one of the little push I need  If you \u2019 re look for a push  you may want to consider \u2018 TryDay Friday \u2019  a challenge that be start by Dia  Co  an online clothing company that provide their customer with new outfit that be design to create confidence and help take fashion risk  Despite many thing happen in our country  I be feel optimistic for our community  We be make progress  socially and politically  It \u2019 s not always be easy  but baby step  you know  I be also excite about your grow confidence  Yes  yours  Do something that scar you  wear something that scar you  Love  Hannah ", "feedtitle":
