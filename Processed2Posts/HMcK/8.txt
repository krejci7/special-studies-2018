what people be think  but the point I try to make be that you will never know what people think  For the most part  I have have only positive  or at least unremarkable interaction out in the real world  I \u2019 ve be go out for more than five year now and I almost forget that I be do something that I use to be terrify in do  It \u2019 s always fun to go out  but it \u2019 s normal these day  I \u2019 ve go from \u201c I \u2019 m go out into the real world and I better have my guard up \u201d to \u201c I \u2019 m go out into the real world and I need a coffee \u201d That \u2019 s good  right  That be say  my guard be always up  it need to be  but have my guard up be second nature and I don \u2019 t even think about it  It \u2019 s just\u2026always up  I \u2019 m always breathing  my guard be always up  I \u2019 ve say before that what someone think of you be none of your business  And it \u2019 s true  I don \u2019 t want to know what you think of me  unless of course you think my lipstick be cute  you like my dress or you \u2019 re compliment me on my ability to walk in stiletto  I don \u2019 t think anyone mind when someone say something nice about u  and I think for the most part people be generally kind and likely win \u2019 t say anything negative to you  But the world be fill with jerk who feel it \u2019 s their right  maybe their obligation  to tell you what \u2019 s on their mind and to harass you  I know that people at the mall don \u2019 t care what I think  so why do they suppose I care about what they think  Guess what  I don \u2019 t  Although for the most part my adventure have be wonderful  I still get second glance and stare  And that \u2019 s okay  I look amaze and I don \u2019 t mind  You look amazing  too  by the way  I don \u2019 t spend any time try to figure out why someone be star  but I be selfaware enough to know I be well over six foot tall in heel and I be likely wear a \u201c lookatthisfabulousdress \u201d dress so I be not surprise by the look  I be also a tgirl and  let \u2019 s face it  not everyone have see a transperson before out in the real world so it \u2019 s not unrealistic someone see me and be process it for a moment  And this be okay  I know I be ready to go out into the real world once I accept the fact that people would probably always react this way  Being prepare for the bad make the positive  even the mundane experience  even well  But people be people and some think that their opinion and perspective need to be hear  I know that there be many people  for many reason  whether politically or religiously or whatever  think that transpeople are\u2026well  not okay  We \u2019 re unnatural  heathen  pervert  confuse  or not part of God \u2019 s plan  I understand that others will have this perspective and belief system  but I be not on this planet to make anyone but myself happy  I be not live my life to make others comfortable and neither be you  Well  maybe you be  I don \u2019 t know  Are you  I have no illusion about myself or how others see me  I fully accept that others \u201c know \u201d I be trans  And with that  I also fully accept that others will think of me a a man in a dress  a guy playing dress up or something derogatory  Some member of the transcommunity embrace the term \u201c tranny \u201d  but I think it \u2019 s offensive  Regardless  most people don \u2019 t care about me and what I \u2019 m wearing and they be distract and engage in their own life  or  more likely  star at their phone  Some people do want to share their opinion and for the most part  it \u2019 s overwhelmingly positive  Some will compliment my outfit whether it \u2019 s because they sincerely like it  or because it \u2019 s another way of say \u201c I support the transcommunity \u201d and will go out of my way to make me feel welcome  But the point be that there will always be those that just don \u2019 t like u  If you go out at all  whether once a year or once a week or live fulltime  the odds be pretty good someone will say something that will not be very nice  How you react to it be one thing  but be prepared and accept that you \u2019 ll likely have that experience do make it easy to leave the living room  Last year at the mall I be have a nice afternoon shopping  of course  and a woman walk across the hall and intentionally bump into me and loudly say \u201c oh  excuse me  SIR \u201d  At first I be confuse  I be wear a cute white dress with a floral pattern  match accessory  nude heel  my favorite lipstick and carry a purse  It take me a moment to remember that not everyone will respond to me a the gender a I be present a  Once that moment of confusion pass  I realize what have happen  Although I will never know why she do this  it be pretty clear she want to make me feel uncomfortable  stupid or embarrass  Perhaps she felt that I need to know that I wasn \u2019 t \u201c fooling \u201d her  I don \u2019 t know  I don \u2019 t know what she think of me  I didn \u2019 t ask  I didn \u2019 t care  Still don \u2019 t  So  what happen next  Well  nothing  to be honest  It wasn \u2019 t worth think about or speculate about  Rude people be not worth your time or energy  Don \u2019 t let them steal your sparkle  It didn \u2019 t ruin my day or bother me or hurt my feeling in the slightest  I didn \u2019 t feel stupid  I didn \u2019 t feel embarrass  I didn \u2019 t feel ugly or male  Whatever she want to accomplish  she fail miserably  I go on to have a fabulous afternoon and evening  find two really cute dress and have a fun  thirty minute conversation about politics with a grandmother  her daughter and her granddaughter from Missouri  You \u2019 ll have good day  bad day and day that be unremarkable  You \u2019 ll have day where you \u2019 ll find the perfect matching heel for the dress you buy two year ago but have never wear  You \u2019 ll have day where you \u2019 ll have lipstick on your teeth and run your stocking  You \u2019 ll have day where you stumble a little in your stiletto and lose an earring  You \u2019 ll have day where someone will call you \u2018 sir \u2019 and smirk  You \u2019 ll have day where a grandmother from St Louis will call you the sweet thing and waiter will call you \u2018 ma \u2019 be \u2019  Mama say there would be day like this  and she be right  Love  Hannah ",
