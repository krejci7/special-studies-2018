["Uncategorized", "activism", "transgender"], "text": "One of the first book I ever read about be crossdressing be write by Charlie Jane Anders and title \u2018 The Lazy Crossdresser \u2019  If I ever be to write a book  I think it would be call \u2018 The Realistic TGirl \u2019  If I have a message  it \u2019 s that be who we be is\u2026complicated and super fun and stressful all at the same time to vary degree  Some day be more fun or stressful or humble than others  It \u2019 s not all pink and high heel and glitter  I would be wonderful if we could be who we be without any sort of criticism  discrimination  fear  hatred  sideways glance or smirk  But that \u2019 s not realistic  For some  it would be wonderful for u to \u201c pas \u201d  to appear in public without anyone thinking that we be genetically male or transgender  I have write pretty extensively about my perspective about \u201c passing \u201d previously and although I don \u2019 t believe in \u201c pass \u201d  I understand why this be a goal for some of u  It be a goal for myself year ago but I don \u2019 t care at all what others think of who I be when I go out  For some of u  we want to be able to look so feminine that no one will think we be bear male  But that \u2019 s not realistic  What help me go beyond the idea of passing be simply slip on a pair of heel and experience the world a who I be  I absolutely accept that it \u2019 s incredibly likely that anyone who see me know that I be transgender  but my experience teach me that the vast majority of people in the world could care less  That first time out during the day I interact with baristas  cashier  people at Target and restaurant server and have nothing but positive or at least mundane experience  Some people go out of their way to be kind and some didn \u2019 t even bat an eye when they saw me  I have low expectation the first time I go out  I be scar to death and be hop that no one would laugh at me or threaten me or set me on fire for be a threat to society  That didn \u2019 t happen and I be pleased that even after all these year I still have not be burn at the stake  My experience teach me that no one really care that I \u2019 m transgender  It would be incredible if no one in the world care if anyone be transgender  But that \u2019 s not realistic  We live in a world be people hate u  fear u  misunderstand u and do not even try to  We live in a world where law be consistently introduce to repress our right  We live in a world where the CDC have ban the very name many of u use to identify who we be  We live in a world be transgender men and woman do get harass  threaten  hurt and kill on a daily basis simply for exist  But this will surely change  right  Maybe not for a couple year but this will change  right  No  It win \u2019 t  That \u2019 s not pessimism  That \u2019 s reality  Social justice and social change take decade  even century sometimes  if the change happen at all  Look back throughout history and you will see that we can pass all the law we want  but that doesn \u2019 t mean everything be fine  Sure  woman be give the right to vote in 1920 but that didn \u2019 t solve the problem of gender inequality  Slavery be abolish in 1865 but the Klu Klux Klan still exist  I do not expect the hatred and misunderstanding of who we be to go away in my lifetime  in yours  or in the next generation \u2019 s lifetime  It would be nice\u2026 But that \u2019 s not realistic  So  how do we live and be happy and accept ourselves when so many thing we want be not realistic  For starter  you just have to strut out of the house  head hold high wear a smile and not give a second thought to what others be thinking\u2026because for the most part  they don \u2019 t care  And really  how will you know what they think  Are you plan on ask them  If there \u2019 s anything I want others to take away from my blog it \u2019 s how to manage our expectation when reality might be work against u  For myself  it would be wonderful if I could spend just 15 minute on my makeup and head out the door  But the reality be that I be genetically male and hair grow out of my cheek  neck and all over my face  I can shave very closely  but I still have a light hue to my face  So  in my reality  I need to do some color correcting and add three layer of different foundation to counter that  It would also be idea if I could just pop into Target and find a new pair of heel that fit  but in my reality I need to shop at store that sell heel that go up to size 11 12 and most store stop selling shoe after size 11  So close  My shopping reality take a little adapting  but it \u2019 s fine  I \u2019 ve learn how to live with it  My reality also mean  at time  a complicate relationship with some people in my life  but again  I \u2019 ve readjust my expectation  It would be wonderful if we could all be who we be without fear of\u2026anything from anyone in our life  from the gas station cashier to our parent  It would be amaze if everyone accept u  love u  It would be incredible for u to have \u201c permission \u201d to walk out the door in our favorite dress without fear of anything  But that \u2019 s not realistic  Instead  we can accept ourselves  We can love ourselves  Acceptance and permission do not need to come from the government  from society or from our family  It doesn \u2019 t need to  Even if we be give this from others  it doesn \u2019 t matter if we don \u2019 t give this to ourselves  It \u2019 s hard to be who we be  I get that  I know that  For those who be not where they want to be this be very much understood  For those who have accept and embrace who we be we know that this do not come easy  and it \u2019 s still not always easy  Reality is\u2026well  it \u2019 s difficult at best  We can not wait for reality to line up with what we want to be who we be  If you be wait for everyone in the world to signal that it \u2019 s okay to be transgender then you \u2019 ll be wait a very  very long time  Instead  it \u2019 s time to buy that dress and hit the mall  The museum  The step of the capital  Anywhere you want  Any acceptance  tolerance and legal right we have come from those before u  The brave men and woman who march  who demonstrate  who be arrest  who be hurt and kill for what we have have bring attention and change to our social and legal status  We may not have everything we want or deserve  but it \u2019 s slowly  slowly get there  But what we have come from some form of activism  whether it be a protest  a campaign or by simply exist  I like to think that when I be out in the real world I be help create awareness that transpeople exist and that we \u2019 re normal and not a threat to a society  I like to think that the more people see u  the more unremarkable we become to others which lead to more acceptance  If we want to the real world to accept u  then we need to get out in the real world  So yes  get a makeover and hit the mall look amaze can lead to social change  How fun be that  It \u2019 s unrealistic to wait for the world to love u and accept u before we let ourselves be who we be  or want to be  Be you  Be you now  Love  Hannah ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
