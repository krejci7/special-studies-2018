Hannah"], "text": "Do they have book on transgender  crossdressers right when we go out on the town  Before I jump into this  please visit and bookmark these two link that provide answer and information to frequently ask question regard the law and right of transgender individual  ACLU Human Rights Campaign I \u2019 m sure there be book  however  with how frequently the law can change  a book will eventually become outdated  As far a I know  there aren \u2019 t any state that say it be illegal to be transgender  But that doesn \u2019 t mean we don \u2019 t have a long time to go  As of today  it be legal to fire someone on the basis for be transgender in over half of the state in the country  According to the Human Rights Campaign  Right now in 32 state there be no state law protect transgender people from be fire for be who they be  Only 18 state  CA  CO  CT  DE  HI  IL  IA  MA  ME  MD \u2014 effective Oct 2014  MN  NJ  NM  NV  OR  RI  VT and WA  and DC currently prohibit discrimination base on gender identity  We all have right  but each day we hear of someone \u2019 s basic civil right be violate  Discrimination base on gender and race will likely always exist  You have the right to be treat a a human be  but that doesn \u2019 t mean everyone will respect you and interact with you in the way you deserve  unfortunately  You should also be aware of what the law in your state be when it come to use the restroom that align with your gender identity  According to the ACLU  There \u2019 s no clear answer here because very few court have consider this question and the result have be mix  In two recent positive decision  an administrative agency in Colorado in 2013 and the Maine Supreme Court in 2014 both rule that under those state \u2019 gender identity discrimination law  transgender girl have the right to use girl \u2019 restroom at their public school  On the other hand  a 2001 Minnesota Supreme Court decision find that even a law prohibit gender identity discrimination didn \u2019 t necessarily protect a transgender woman \u2019 s right to use the woman \u2019 s restroom at work  And a federal appeal court in 2007 uphold the Utah Transit Authority \u2019 s decision to fire a transgender bus driver  base on a claim that her employer could be sue for her use of woman \u2019 s public restroom along her bus route  In a nonworkplace context  a New York appeal court rule in 2005 that it wasn \u2019 t sex discrimination for a building owner to prevent transgender people from use gender identityappropriate restroom in a building where several business share restroom  Authorities in some jurisdiction  eg  Colorado  Iowa  Oregon  Washington State  San Francisco  New York City  and the District of Columbia   however  have specifically say that deny transgender people the right to use a gender identityappropriate restroom violate their nondiscrimination law  Some jurisdiction  eg  Iowa  San Francisco  and DC  go far and make clear that transgender people can \u2019 t be require to prove their gender to gain access to a public restroom  unless everyone have to show ID to use that restroom  Other jurisdiction  eg  Chicago  continue to allow business to decide whether a transgender patron may access men \u2019 s or woman \u2019 s restroom base on the gender on their ID  which may or may not reflect accurately the person \u2019 s gender identity  Many business  university  and other public place be instal single stall  genderneutral restroom  which alleviate many of the difficulty that transgender people experience when seek safe restroom access  Some city  such a Austin  Philadelphia  Washington  DC  and West Hollywood  have local law that require singlestall public restroom to be label a unisex  While this be often a useful step towards address the concern of transgender people and others  the ACLU believe that transgender people should have the right to use restroom that match their gender identity rather than be restrict to only use genderneutral one  My advice be to use a gender neutral bathroom if possible  There be also an app and website call Refugee Restroom that  accord to their website  REFUGE be a web application that seek to provide safe restroom access for transgender  intersex  and gender nonconforming individual  When the Safe2Pee website pass out of functionality it leave a hole in our heart  REFUGE pick up the torch where Safe2Pee leave off and make the valuable resource available to those who find themselves in need of a place to pee safely once again  Users can search for restroom by proximity to a search location  add new restroom listing  as well a comment and rate exist listing  We seek to create a community focus not only on find exist safe restroom access but also look forward and participate in restroom advocacy for transgender  intersex  and gender nonconforming folk  Be aware of your right  Be safe  Love  Hannah ",
