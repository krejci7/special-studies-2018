"family"], "text": "Hi Hannah  I \u2019 ve be cross dressing for almost 2 year now  Was it hard to go out in public for the first time  and what be your friend and family \u2019 s response  It be hard to go out the first time  but each time I \u2019 ve go out it have get easier  The first time you go out  I would recommend go to a PFLAG meeting or another LGBTQ support group  Knowing you be go to meet a supportive group of people will make our first time out a little easy  Before you go out  please make sure you be ready  Before I go out  I always make sure my purse have  Eyeliner Lipstick Finishing powder Mascara That \u2019 s the fun stuff  The reality be that I have a lot more in my purse than makeup  I recommend every tgirl have the follow in their purse  Cash  This be pretty obvious but I use cash for everything when I go out  If I want to get a coffee or need to pay for parking  I use cash  I like cash because I don \u2019 t run the risk of turn over my credit card  with my male name  to a cashier  I also bring my debit and credit card just in case  Proof of car insurance  If you get into an accident or get pull over  you \u2019 ll need to provide proof of insurance  Simple enough but plan for the bad  Fully charge cell phone  Pretty selfexplanatory  You \u2019 ll need it in case of emergency  Any emergency  Roadside assistance information  You need to know who to contact if you get a flat tire  Sure  I can change a tire myself  but no way I be do that in a dress or heel  Driver \u2019 s license  Again  if you get pull over\u2026 Spare car key  If you \u2019 re not use to carry a purse  you might forget to place your key in it  A spare key tuck in your purse save a call to a locksmith  Medical insurance card  Again  plan for the bad  A friend  I don \u2019 t mean bring a friend with you  though shopping be a lot more fun if you do  but if you \u2019 re out to anyone in your life  drop them a message to let them know you \u2019 re step out  It \u2019 s good to let someone know you \u2019 re out on the town in case you need help  I would also recommend download the Uber or Lyft app  If you run into car trouble and need help  have this on your phone can be a lifesaver  I have an app on my phone and I have multiple account associate with it  One for my male life  one for Hannah  I \u2019 ve use Uber a both gender and I \u2019 ve never have an issue  Where should you go  Anywhere you want  but plan ahead  Is there a GLBT friendly coffee shop in town  Maybe start there  Or a GLBT bar  That \u2019 s another option  For your first time out  some of u go someplace where they \u2019 re use to see girl like u  It \u2019 s important to get use to be out in public and it \u2019 s easy if you know you \u2019 re not the first tgirl  or the only tgirl there  If there \u2019 s not a place like that in your area  I bet there \u2019 s a PFLAG or a TriEss chapter that meet near you  Being comfortable out will take time but you will get there  I never think I \u2019 d go to a restaurant or a mall or a gas station in heel  but I do it all the time  Not comfortable yet in your area  Drive to a big city  Get a hotel room there  have an adventure  Bigger city tend to be more liberal and open mind than small town  When I go to downtown Minneapolis  I walk down the street confident in know I be not the first or last transgirl to strut that street that day  Bigger city have see girl like u before  Will people see you  Of course they will  You \u2019 re out in public  Will they point  Will they laugh  Will they whisper behind your back  Maybe  But really  so what  I go out all the time and very  very rarely do anything like that happen  And the more often I go out  the less I notice it  Will people recognize you  Maybe  If you \u2019 re afraid of that happen  again  go to a different town  I know I be nervous people would point and snicker while I be out in the real world  but that hasn \u2019 t really happen to me  I \u2019 ve interact with everyone from baristas to shop clerk to gas station employee to waiter and I \u2019 ve never have a bad experience  No one have be rude or laugh or anything  The world be a wonderful place sometimes  Safety be the number one concern  of course  I know what part of my city be safe and I \u2019 m sure you do too so don \u2019 t go there  Go somewhere where you can park in a well lit area as well  Going out for the first time be nerve wrack enough but go someplace a little iffy be just add more stress that you don \u2019 t need  Looking back  I have only come out to my friend who be LGBTQ  and it \u2019 s all go very well  Now that I think about it  I have only come out to maybe five friend  Coming out to my mom and sister be both very different experience  I think if I be to do it all over again  I definitely would do thing differently  I \u2019 ve write a little about this previously  But  the short version be that my family love me  they understand me a best they can and I love them  Love  Hannah ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Hannah McKnight"}
