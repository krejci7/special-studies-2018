feminine clothing at work  And while I have build it up in my head a this huge conversation  it be actually very chill and amazing  She be fully supportive of me wear a diversity of professional clothing that felt comfortable to me and didn \u2019 t have gendered expectation of what that look like  I felt so value and respect that I walk out of there and immediately gush on Facebook about how wonderful it be  This wasn \u2019 t the first conversation we have about it but this felt like the big deal to me  I start this job 7 week ago after leave a job I have be at for 3 year where I come out slowly while work there  No one at my previous company treat me badly because of my gender and I have several wonderful ally there  but most people didn \u2019 t really seem to get it and didn \u2019 t ask question to understand  When I try wear more gender affirm clothing I get less compliment and people seem a little awkward around me  So I eventually give up try until my last week when I stop give a fuck and come into work in dress and skirt  I \u2019 m not the great about assert my gender and pronoun and I feel incredibly awkward have the \u201c come out \u201d conversation at work  My role be very service orient and the mindset of make everyone else \u2019 s job easy be hard to break  I choose when I be interview not to come out and I dress in fairly masculine attire  with purple in my shirt of course  base on the advice of a couple trans woman I speak to who say that get the job be ultimately more important than be yourself all the time  But when I be start to be introduce to new colleague with hehim pronoun it felt really weird  I didn \u2019 t want to correct my teammate while they be talk and embarrass them so I didn \u2019 t know how to come out tactfully  When I finally have a moment to breathe and sit down at my new desk I decide that I want to just get it off my chest and tell all three of my main teammate at the same time  I send this email to them on my first day  I keep forget to mention this when we \u2019 re talk and I \u2019 m a bit shy about correct people but I think I should tell you while we \u2019 re still do introduction and meet new people that I prefer theythem pronoun for myself  I \u2019 m genderqueer which be a nonbinary trans identity  Happy to talk about it more but I want to let you all know while I \u2019 m think about it  Example  This be  Genderbeard   They be the new support staff for Dr  X   I be happily surprise to quickly get supportive response from them AND to have them immediately start use my pronoun in email and introduction  They stumble a bit of course in the first few week but so do I  even refer to myself in third person sometimes  I \u2019 m happy to say that my bos have not only consistently use them for the past few week but she correct others in the office when I \u2019 m not there  She say the example sentence be particularly helpful which be something I should keep in mind  The first few week on the job I continue to dress in what most people would perceive a gay male fashion  bright collar shirt  fashionable shoe  colorful pant  partly because I be test the water of the office culture and mostly because I didn \u2019 t have professional level femme clothing yet  But the last couple week I have start to incorporate more androgynous blend of colorful \u201c men \u2019 s section \u201d pant with blouse  On the quiet summer day I talk with my bos  this be what I be wear    In our conversation she not only affirm that the only expectation be a professional level of clothe appropriate to the day \u2019 s activity and guest but emphasize the nongendered nature of our dress code  She tell me she already have conversation with HR about how she and them could best support me only to sadly find out that they have no clue and no resource  When they jump to want to use me a a spokesperson for all genderqueer people at the company  she defend me and emphasize her view about treat me with respect and not tokenizing me  Needless to say  I be overjoy with her response and I feel incredibly lucky to have find this job and this team  To make an already long story short  the take home message here be that sometimes your own fear be the big barrier  and the financial resource to buy new clothes maybe   If you take a risk and put yourself out there you may be pleasantly surprise by the response  I agonize for week over how to have these conversation and when I do I be meet with only support and respect  I \u2019 m so glad I take the risk I have and I \u2019 m excite to continue build up a professional wardrobe and share it here  ", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 6 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
