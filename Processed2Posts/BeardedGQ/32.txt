\u2019 t talk about that side of my history a much  But I be homeschooled  from age 418 I be primarily teach by my parent and selftaught from religious base textbook and curriculum with some Evangelical Christian coop education mix in  I \u2019 m not try to claim all homeschooling be unhealthy but it can easily be use to hide abuse  both physical and spiritual  I \u2019 ve spend many year try to heal both the social awkwardnessanxiety that result as well a try to purge and retrain my brain not to think in the pattern I be teach  The reason I bring it up now be because my friend bring this article to my attention today  I Was Trained for the Culture Wars in Home School  Awaiting Someone Like Mike Pence a a Messiah It be bring up a lot of feeling and remind me of just how dangerous Christian Fundamentalist Homeschooling be  So here \u2019 s a bit of an insider perspective from my corner of the \u201c Quiverfull \u201d movement  If you \u2019 re lucky  you \u2019 ve never heard of Bill Gothard  The Institute for Basic Life Principles  or their Advanced Training Institute homeschool program  If you have  it be hopefully because of the sexual abuse charge or from the multitude of u who have escape the cult and be finally tell our story  Back in the \u2019 70  Gothard go around the country a a motivational speaker type  fill space like Key Arena with hoard of young adult listen to his Basic Life Principles seminar on how to get out of debt and claim your power in the patriarchy  As he grow his base  he start create multiple layer of insider and use them to infiltrate major political and power structure  At the height of their power their Character First curriculum be use in the Oklahoma Public School System among others  they basically run the orphanage system in Romania  and have prominent member throughout many government and corporate leadership  This wasn \u2019 t a denomination or a church  it be a network of people basically live underground  and sometimes off the grid  who infiltrate the more extreme evangelical church and pull them even far right  And l you think it only happen in rural area  I should tell you that I grow up in King County Washington  one of the most consistently liberal place in the country  But until I go to college  I rarely meet an atheist or nonEvangelical person in my life  As with any cult  Gothard be the sole figurehead and his word be law  All their material have the primary goal of get you to believe that his precise interpretation of the bible  and the Constitution  be the only way  Men be the sole head and breadwinner of the house and should be the only one with access to television and the internet  Your Godgiven duty be to have as many kid a possible and train them to reject all \u201c dominant culture \u201d You should simultaneously attempt to convert a many people a possible by make them \u201c your disciple \u201d and yet reject anyone from your life who wasn \u2019 t Christian enough  Children couldn \u2019 t date but they have a complex courtship process setup where you spend time around their family with stated intention and eventually marry after never have even be alone together much less kiss  And there be some really far out stuff like how Cabbage Patch doll be demon possess and religious symbol from other culture be idol that could corrupt your family  But the part that it share with the large Fundamentalist Homeschooling movement that boom in the \u2019 80 be extreme xenophobia lead to attempt to outpopulate \u201c heathen \u201d and work towards a Godordained theocracy  Christofacism a the article call it  in America  The work of David Barton and other \u201c historian \u201d rewrite the past and present to fit their worldview  And child be train in mental gymnastics and formal debate technique to turn them into tiny \u201c arrow \u201d to shoot against your foe  For three summer I go to a high school camp call Worldview Academy that ostensibly teach you to \u201c not check your brain at the door \u201d and think for yourself  Really  it be a brainwashing camp design to make you invincible to any attempt by publicliberal college to sway you from your black and white thinking  Luckily for me  I go to a Christian college with moderate professor who give me a safe place to ask question that I have be bury for year and help u form our own opinion  I nearly lose my family when I first say that I believe in egalitarian relationship but since then they have mellow out quite a bit  Distance from the cult have definitely be a big factor  I be lucky enough not to have become extremely politically involved during that period of my life  The first major election I vote in be for Obama and I have since lose touch with how that community think a I \u2019 ve work hard to retrain my brain and systematically evaluate my belief and assumption  But this article have remind me of just how dangerous this movement be  Like many of you  I have assume that there would be a large portion of Evangelical America that would outright reject DT because his belief be largely antithetical to everything they preach  I know my parent vote third party for the first time in their adult life because they actually have consistent  if flaw  moral  But what I forget be that they have spend decade not only groom their constituent but literally give birth to an army of conformist  There be ten of thousand of adult child across America descend from those cult member and you \u2019 d good believe that every single one of them vote  There be a lot of blame shift go around about why we lose the election  We know for sure it wasn \u2019 t because of people of color and I don \u2019 t think blame \u201c white work class \u201d Americans a a group be fair  But I do blame the hypocritical Evangelical Americans who turn out enmasse to vote for someone they would have vilify if they didn \u2019 t think that the end would justify the mean  Now I \u2019 m wake up to the fact that between the kleptocrat egomaniac without a handle on his temper and a theocrat bigot poise in the wing  they be one giant leap close to their goal  I don \u2019 t know what the solution be  These people be largely immune to reason and empathy  They literally only listen to people who be like them and endorse by the tiny men behind the curtain  But I do know that we need to be just a engage and outrage a they have be teach to be  They pull the string from underground but we can take to the street in great mass than they ever can  What we \u2019 ve learn be that you can \u2019 t underestimate your foe  They be cunning and dangerous and very well prepared  It \u2019 s easy not to take them seriously  but now that thing be seriously wrong we be go to have to behave differently  ", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 4 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
