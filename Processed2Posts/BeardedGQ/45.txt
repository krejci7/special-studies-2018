It \u2019 s be a consistent theme for me that have shape so much of who I be  include why I be an administrative assistant today  My job be all about make someone else \u2019 s job easy  In the nonprofit world  that can be a good thing because I \u2019 m work for worthy cause and help others use their talent  But in most area of my life  it isn \u2019 t serve me well and ultimately it really isn \u2019 t help other people in the way that I think it be  I spend my childhood try to live up to the standard of a fundamentalist form of Christianity  It have very gendered expectation about my role a someone who be suppose to grow up to be the patriarch  decision maker  sole bread winner  and father  I try so hard to live up to those image and in my various attempt I fell prey to some aspect of toxic masculinity  By the time I be 18  I be a poster child of obedience and conformity  I go off to college able to debate with the best of them on the apologetics of Calvinism and prepare with a stack of book about creation \u201c science \u201d to argue with my \u201c liberal \u201d Christian professor  But I come to the realization at 18 that even within my closed circle of Evangelical friend  I be a real asshole and unpleasant to be around  In attempt to please my church and my parent  I have turn into a judgmental person stick in blackandwhite thinking  Because I want everyone else to like me  I resolve to change\u2026 or at least to be less vocal about my judgment and take more time to listen  Luckily for me  my choice of an Evangelical liberal art university give me the opportunity to grow and change in a nonthreatening environment  Within 2 year I have transform into a liberal pacifist and thrown my conservative history behind me  But I hadn \u2019 t stop try to please other people  When my best friend express romantic interest in me  I ignore the warning flag about her personality and dive head first into an allconsuming relationship which find me marry before my junior year at only 21  I spend the next 7 year do everything within my power to please her  bend over backwards and almost completely lose myself in the process  She be control  manipulative  gaslighting  and emotionally abusive  She use my selfabasing tendency to her benefit and have me convince that her opinion be right on everything  My feeling be unimportant  Under the guise of want me to \u201c fulfill my true potential  \u201d she mold me into the type of person that give her the status of a successful married professional that she want to be in her life  We have the beginning of a sexual relationship when we first start date but that all but end once we get officially engage  We didn \u2019 t have intercourse until 5 year into the marriage and she use that a a dangling carrot  always something in the future to be work towards if I do the thing she want  The only reason we ever even try it  very unsatisfactorily  be because she know she be lose me  As a sexual person I be deeply unfulfilled in our relationship but whenever I would voice that it would become all about her  Slowly she train me to basically be her servant  fetch anything she want and meet her every need  She demand massage which begin a an exchange but eventually become something I would just do for her  Even when I be work 10 hour day she would still expect me to come home and do all the cooking and household chore  I pass this off a a positive thing because we didn \u2019 t have gendered role in our relationship  but really it be just abusive  When I would try to talk about my need and desire they be push aside in favor of her need  If I use emotional content in a conversation my feeling be dismiss because she only believe in logic  until her repressed feeling would inconveniently bubble to the surface in which case I have to sooth her   I be always set up to fail when we argue because she have training a a debater  In public I be the dutiful husband and we be the \u201c power couple \u201d at our church  but in actuality  I have no power  Despite all that  I didn \u2019 t talk about my problem to anyone else because I didn \u2019 t want to burden anyone  In my attempt to make others \u2019 life easy  I allow mine to become a living hell of consume depression  I would pathologically avoid be alone with my feeling because they would lead to very dark place  There be time I think that the only thing that keep me alive be that I didn \u2019 t want to die a \u201c virgin \u201d I try so hard to volunteer and do good thing during that time but I be unable to really be effective because I hadn \u2019 t take care of myself first  And because daily life take so much work  I put my own selfdiscovery on the back burner  All my gender feel turn into a festering anxiety in the background  After 5 year of a very unhappy marriage and couple therapy  it be so clear that thing weren \u2019 t work that we be have serious conversation about divorce  But I be still so stuck in the model of meet everyone else \u2019 s need before my own  include not disappointing my parent who didn \u2019 t approve of divorce  that I agree to stay  I do finally prioritize one thing though  It be important to me that I have a sexually fulfilling life which be never go to happen with my wife  She want any outside relationship to be a sex only arrangement but that \u2019 s not what fulfill me  So we compromise and I be \u201c allow \u201d to pursue polyamorous relationship under some very strict rule and in secrecy  Through reading resource on polyamory that focus on the importance of know your boundary and finally see model for healthy relationship  I slowly begin to come into my own and prioritize myself little by little  This result in a backlash at home a my wife could see her perfect arrangement slip away  But I be able to see the world outside the bubble I \u2019 d be isolate in for the first time and find people more like myself who be comfortable in their gender and sexuality  When I finally come out a genderqueer and pansexual  she want me to keep it secret from all but a few confidant because she didn \u2019 t want to have to answer question about my gender or her feeling about my sexuality  That be what finally start to break down my mental block around divorce and get me think about what it might look like to truly love my life and myself  Still  I be so afraid of be unloveable that I stay in a marriage where love be conditional on my continued silence and suppression of my identity  Polyamory isn \u2019 t easy  especially when you be start out and have a lot of restriction place on you  My wife would yell at me if I be 3 minute late come home from a date and she want me to tell her everything that be wrong with the people I be date and why she be good than them  But after a lot of date attempt that never make it past the third date  I begin date a wonderful woman who encourage me to voice my need and set boundary  It start out a a casual relationship with no expectation but within a couple month it be clear that I be in love  That bring thing to a breaking point in my marriage  I be start to be happy and learn to say no to unreasonable request and my wife couldn \u2019 t stand that  After 4 month in that relationship she change tactic and be suddenly interested in sex  But it come with string attach  She want me to choose between her  and a straight monogamous life  and polyamory  Luckily by that point I have do enough selfwork that I be able to connect with my feeling and consider what I actually want  My therapist ask me to focus on the sensation in my body a I imagine my future in both scenario and immerse myself fully in the feeling of both option  It take an agonizing few week a I wrestle with that decision  get pressure from my wife the whole time  I will forever be grateful to my girlfriend who stick with me in a fairly new relationship through that uncertainty and allow me to make that choice for myself  In the end it be clear what I need to do  As uncertain a my future be if I leave  I know that I would be forever unhappy if I continue to give so much of myself up to be in that marriage  Leaving be the hard thing I \u2019 ve ever do but it be also the best decision I ever make  I move in with my girlfriend  temporarily at first  but I take step to make sure that I didn \u2019 t fall into old pattern of please others at my own expense  18 month later it still take a lot of work to undo those old pattern  but with the memory of those experience still fresh in my head  I keep at it  My life now be radically different  not just because of my lifestyle  but because of how I be treat by my partner and how I treat myself  No longer do I accept relationship where there be an unsustainable imbalance of emotional energy or physical labor  All three of my long term romantic relationship require investment  commitment  and a good deal of energy  But because I know what my limit be  where my boundary be  and how to say no  I have the ability to do far more for others than I ever be before  That mean seek out relationship with people who also value consent and prioritize their own self awareness  It also help that none of u rely solely on one person to meet all of our need  We each have other relationship  both romantic and platonic  that support our emotional and physical need  We have all structure our life together in supportive community where vulnerability be value and intimacy be not fear  Now my life be my own  No one own me no matter what happen  no one can tell me what I feel or who I be  And that be why it be so important to me that my gender isn \u2019 t about who I \u2019 m in relationship with  and how they define their sexuality   I win \u2019 t let it be simplify or hide to make thing easy for other people to understand or be more comfortable with  My gender be complicate and it can feel like it make thing \u201c difficult \u201d for others  and for me  but not living a my full self cause far more harm to myself and ultimately to my ability to actually help others  The airline announcement be true \u2013 you do need to put on your own oxygen before help the person next to you  ", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 5 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
