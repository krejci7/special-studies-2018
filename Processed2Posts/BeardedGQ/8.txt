in March but since it \u2019 s on my mind now  I want to say a few thing  mostly for the benefit of ally and friend who aren \u2019 t part of the trans and nonbinary community  Transgender people come in literally all shape and size and color  If you have a type of person that you picture when you think of u  I want to you make a conscious effort to broaden that  Trans people have every kind of genital arrangement imaginable  Some people be bear with genitals outside of the binary assumption which we usually call intersex  And some intersex people identify a trans and some do not  Some people choose to have one or more of a wide variety of gender affirm surgery to align their body with their identity  and for some people that isn \u2019 t even a choice but the difference between life and death  Some people consider themselves preop and be save up for surgery or be try to navigate a healthcare system that try to exclude u  Some people be wait for the outofthebox option they want to become available  like myself   Some people redefine their relationship with their genitals and may use different term to refer to the part they be bear with  And some people don \u2019 t have any genital dysphoria  Trans people don \u2019 t look a particular way  There be a many way of performing and describe gender a there be people in the world  Some people want to be exclusively masculine or feminine and may describe a trans woman or trans men  Some people want to blend in or \u201c pas \u201d while others prioritize feel like themselves even if they don \u2019 t fit in  Some people be feminine but butch at the same time  Some people try to find a neutral place in the middle  Some people combine aspect of \u201c traditional \u201d gender binary to create their own blend  Some people swing far in one direction and then settle on somewhere in the middle  And believe me when I say that someone \u2019 s appearance can \u2019 t tell you a damn thing about what they look like when they be bear  Trans people come from every culture and race in the world  The idea that this be a new phenomenon be a very Western perspective  Gender diversity outside the binary have exist on nearly every continent for all of recorded history with an incredible variety of name and concept  European and US colonization have attempt to wipe out many form of gender presentation but we be resilient and many gender warrior have keep these tradition alive  And while the people that you know who be trans may be white  the people most at risk for violence be trans people of color who have lead our movement from the beginning  Trans people use an ever expand vocabulary to describe ourselves and our experience  There be no right or wrong way and for many of u  the evolution of language have literally be a lifesaver in help u discover ourselves and the people like u  Some people use term that others may find offensive  Some people change label a their own understanding of themselves evolves  Some people categorize word differently such a include their nonbinary identity under the trans label while other nonbinary people don \u2019 t feel like they fit in yet another binary of cisgender v transgender  Some people feel like they don \u2019 t have any gender while some people feel like they have a lot  The only way you will know how someone describe themselves be if you respectfully ask  Trans people use more pronoun than you \u2019 ve probably even think of  Some people choose binary label even if they don \u2019 t identify that way  Many people use theythemtheirs a a gender neutral pronoun  reclaim way in which it be use in historic English and continue to be use despite grammar police  Some people use different pronoun depend on how they be feel or present that day  Some people create new term like xexemxyrs and zehirhirs  If you want help learn how to use it in a sentence  just ask  or good yet  look it up  Trans people have every intersection of ability and mental health imaginable  Because of the pressure and discrimination we have face  many of u have the added burden of chronic health and mental illness  Nearly half of u have depression andor anxiety  Over 40  have attempt suicide  And for reason I don \u2019 t think be fully understood  there be a huge overlap between gender nonconformity and autism  When trans people get together we will often talk about these challenge openly even if we may be reluctant to share that with you because of how our identity be so recently treat like a mental illness itself  But just because someone be trans doesn \u2019 t mean you should assume they face these issue either  Even here I \u2019 ve probably say some thing that overgeneralize or erase experience  I apologize for leave thing out but the main point I want you to take away be that you should never make assumption  Even if you think you \u2019 ve never meet a trans person  it \u2019 s very likely that you just didn \u2019 t know it  So rather than find new way to exclude u  think about all the way your community and life could be enrich by the diversity of experience we bring to the table   TransIsBeautiful  TransResilience ",
