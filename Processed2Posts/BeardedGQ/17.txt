on \u201c Detransition \u201d which I refuse to link to here  If you want to read it  you can find it link in this excellent response from trans author Julia Serano \u2013 Stop pit detransitioners against happily transition people  But vent about it on Facebook alone isn \u2019 t helpful so I write the editor this letter  Hello editor  I be a loyal fan of The Stranger and it have be my goto local news source for almost a decade now  I \u2019 m write to you because I genuinely want to see you continue to grow in your understanding and treatment of transgender issue  You \u2019 ve write a lot of great content during Pride but I be extremely disappointed to see the \u201c Detransition \u201d article you publish  particularly this month  I want to be able to continue share and recommend your article and resource but I can \u2019 t in good conscience do that until you publish a follow up to that article apologize for the impact it have on my trans community  I recognize that these be important story that need to be tell  I be not try to invalidate the experience of these anonymous source  But the timing  tone  and lack of nuance in Katie Herzog \u2019 s article be highly problematic and hurtful  It show a lack of compassion for the issue we be face in this state right now and the complexity of the diversity of trans experience  Not to mention the poor journalistic choice of cite the widely discredit Dutch \u201c research \u201d My big beef be with the timing  Washington be on the tip point of take away many of the right that trans activist have work hard to put in place  As you acknowledge in your article  I1552 be threaten our safety and be actively look for fuel to gain the last signature they need  If you have wait just 10 more day to see if their initiative fail  it would be slightly less of an issue  Our healthcare under Apple Health be also on the table and we be fight hard to prove why it be necessary  To undermine our fight  particularly during Pride month  be not only insensitive but downright harmful  You acknowledge that the right wing and TERFs be look for these story but then you hand them to them on a silver platter right at the moment they need them  It be like you be try to play Devil \u2019 s Advocate at a time when the devil doesn \u2019 t need any help  I know Dan Savage would never let you publish a story on \u201c ex gay convert success \u201d story if there be legislation on the table to legalize conversion therapy again  Not because those people don \u2019 t have valid experience but because the timing be harmful  I know there be people who think they be gay and later realize that they be bi  even if they win \u2019 t admit such  or choose to live a a straight person again because of social pressure or change attraction  Those be very real story that deserve to be tell in the right time and place with the appropriate level of nuance  But that be not how you approach this story  You erase the nuance of the various level of social and medical transition and largely treat it a a binary problem  You cite concern about trans youth but don \u2019 t mention hormone blocker until almost the end or really discuss why have the option to postpone that decision be so helpful  You also don \u2019 t treat gender a a journey but rather a yes or no decision  As a genderqueer blogger who write on the topic  http  beardedgenderqueerwordpresscom  I know that that kind of nuance be possible and if you have a trans person authentically consult on this article  or good yet  a the writer  you would know that  Your treatment of the \u201c other side \u201d of transition a this huge problem be on the same level of tonedeafness a treat antivaxxers or climate change denier like they be on equal footing a science in the name of \u201c neutral journalism \u201d Just because there be dissenter doesn \u2019 t mean they hold the same footing a widely proven fact  And you gloss over the fact that it be the discrimination that we face that prompt most of this reversion  For you to publish this article during Pride Month be also particularly hurtful  These be objectively people who be not proud of their identity  or if they be it be essentially a \u201c cisgender pride \u201d story which I hope you know be unacceptable during June  You be amplify the concern of cis people who want more gatekeeping over the voice of trans people during our own month  Plus your end make it sound like everyone could solve dysphoria by be more connect to their body  I know that you know good than to do this  Katie and others on your team speak with Danni Askini at Gender Justice League  local trans leader and professional activist  before you publish the article and she express concern about the tone and timing but yet you still choose to publish it this month and it sound like you lie to her about it as well  Your lack of journalistic ethic this month be appal  I want to quote Julia Serano who you use in your own article in response  Trans people be a marginalized group  People who detransition be also a marginalize group  Here be my advice to all journalist who may want to write about this subject in the future  STOP PITTING MARGINALIZED GROUPS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER  I could say more but I will stop now and leave you with this  I expect you to follow up as soon a possible with an apology to the trans community and to the reader you mislead through your poor reporting and lack of nuance and authentic trans voice  If you want to keep this loyal reader  that be what be require  Thank you for take the time to read this   Name redact  Nonbinary King County native I will follow up here if they respond  ETA 7317  Katie Herzog \u2019 s response just solidifies for me that she be a heartless and careless human be who have no regard for the impact of her work  Instead of listen to any of the multitude of critique from advocate  colleague  and the trans community she just waste an entire long post on \u201c defend \u201d herself by fling accusation at the people tell the background of her poor research  Definitely not interested in read anything else she have her hand in  What you should read instead be these response  When Your Words Are Weapons \u2013 from Ijeoma Oluo Why my piece win \u2019 t be appear in The Stranger \u2013 from Julia Serano  Trans  istioning from False Narratives \u2013 from Karter Booher ", "feedtitle": "Blog \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 The Bearded Genderqueer"}
