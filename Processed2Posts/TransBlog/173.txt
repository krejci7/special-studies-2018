"text": "This be the third in a series of post about gender category  In the first post I discuss the categorization theory of Eleanor Rosch and George Lakoff  In the second I take on the question of whether transgender people be men  woman  some combination  or neither men or woman  and discard the idea that transgender people form some kind of \u201c third gender \u201d In this post I will examine the idea that all transgender people be either men or woman  and that there be no overlap  There be two way separate transgender people into men and woman  One be to assert that each of u be either a man or a woman forever  and that this be determine before birth and unchangeable  The other be that our gender be dependent on a specific feature  and if that feature change then our gender change  I dislike the first approach intensely  and I find the second approach problematic  In the first of these post I discuss how there be two category  man and woman   and it \u2019 s natural that people would prefer to be able to sort every person in the world into one of those two  The category be so complex  it \u2019 s also understandable that people would prefer to have a single criterion for sort  Sadly  the natural world elude any attempt to pin down a single criterion  The most popular criterion be genitals  follow by chromosome  since they \u2019 re the area with the least overlap  but there be plenty of intersex case that defy categorization on both criterion  There be also the difficulty that chromosome be uncategorizable without special equipment  and genitals be also commonly keep hidden  Secondary sex characteristic like breast and hip width be subject to a lot of overlap  and breast can be develop with hormone  Popular within the transgender movement be a notion of gender identity  an innate  immutable characteristic that be claim to determine someone \u2019 s \u201c true \u201d gender  and thus  often  their destiny   it be often claim to be an indication of someone \u2019 s \u201c brain sex \u201d It be argue that all transgender people  or sometimes all \u201c true transgender \u201d people  have a mismatch between the sex assign to them at birth and their gender identity  The problem with this be that there be no direct way to measure gender identity  or brain sex  at all  it be entirely base on individual claim  Thus  even though it be claim to be immutable and eternal  justify claim of destiny   it can change if the individual change his or her mind  This can result in someone be classify a \u201c just a crossdresser  \u201d and therefore innately a man  one week and a transsexual  and therefore innately a woman  the next week  Even if there exist some category of \u201c brain sex  \u201d and it some day become possible to measure this directly rather than rely on subjective report of gender identity  it seem highly unlikely that there be an exact match between on the one hand everyone who have a mismatch between their assign gender and their brain sex  and on the other hand everyone who have change gender or plan to change gender  or who \u201c should \u201d change gender  or who have a reasonable expectation of be satisfy with a gender transition   There will still be people bear male who \u201c successfully \u201d transition to female without a \u201c female brain \u201d and people bear female who lead content life a woman despite have \u201c male brains \u201d If this \u201c brain sex \u201d exist  it be of limited value in classify people a male or female  The idea that category membership depend on a mutable characteristic be also difficult to work with  Obviously government like it  because they can choose an easily verifiable characteristic and one that \u2019 s hard to change and even hard to change back  like genital appearance  But many transgender people have point out that their genitals have relatively little to do with their interaction with other people and that 99  of the time it \u2019 s just a easy  or just a difficult  to deal with people and be accept in a give gender role with mismatched genitals  These hardandfast criterion have a very hard time deal with issue of passing  If someone assign male at birth pass for female  people who don \u2019 t know of her birth gender will treat her a a woman  and in most way it be impractical for people who do know her birth gender to treat her a a man  Attempts to regulate gender privilege base on a single criterion wind up be attempt to outlaw passing  Since I \u2019 ve wound up express dissatisfaction with the \u201c third gender \u201d approach and the \u201c eitheror \u201d approach  you can probably guess that I prefer an approach where people be see a be a mixture of gender  In a late post I will explain how this would work  and why it would be preferable to the two other possibility  ", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
