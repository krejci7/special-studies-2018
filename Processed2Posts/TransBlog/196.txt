oped piece in the North Country Gazette  an Upstate New York newspaper  on the bathroom issue  The article take a skeptical viewpoint on transgender right  but unlike some of the nasty kneejerk rightwing blog  doesn \u2019 t stoop to crass insult  Most of the concern express by the author  Tom Chandler of the New York State Tyranny Response Team  be understandable for someone who know nothing about transgender right  They \u2019 re phrase in the form of question to New York State gubernatorial candidate  I have no idea whether any of the candidate will read them or respond to them  I \u2019 m not run for governor  although I encourage you to vote for Malachy McCourt   but I \u2019 ve get answer to Mr Chandler \u2019 s question  Will men who feel they be really woman now have to get sex segregate job such a rape crisis counselor   there be still job even progressive woman argue should be for woman alone   Will you ever be able to deny a man be woman enough to do a job that he feel prove he be a real woman  There be in fact an example of a transwoman in Vancouver who want to become a rape crisis counselor  but be deny  and in fact  the trans community be not unanimous in believe that she have an automatic right to any such job  Some of u do recognize the role of socialization and childhood experience  But this be a slippery slope argument  and without much more evidence  I don \u2019 t accept the idea that outlaw harassment of transpeople in bathroom will lead to a flood of demand for justifiably sexsegregated job  How do one train a child to be wary of female stranger  who might actually be men disguise a woman  without be hateful and teach \u2018 intolerance     Coincidentally  I just happen to be read about the horrible Moors Murders  warn  graphic description of violence  that take place in the English Midlands in the 1960s  The murderer be a couple name Ian Brady and Myra Hindley  While Brady commit most of the violent act  at least the first three of the five victim be kidnap by Hindley  a nontrans woman  The link Wikipedia article say of the second victim  John Kilbride  Like many child  he have be warn not to go away with strange men but not about strange woman  I think that answer Chandler \u2019 s question  why not teach child to be wary of all stranger  male and female  Female stranger don \u2019 t have to be men or transsexual to be murderer or rapist  What will the school have to teach your child and grand child about transsexual  That they \u2019 re human being deserve of respect  I hope  Does present men who express a woman to child a abused and mistreated people that one should be sympathetic too  encourage predator to pass a transsexual  Apparently not  Transsexuals people have be present in a sympathetic light  at least part of the time  for many year  and not one predator be know to have attempt to pass a a transsexual  Predators don \u2019 t seem too faze by segregated bathroom  and just march right in in their guy clothes and attack whoever they want  In fact  they seem to appreciate a place where they can find woman isolate for their convenience  How much do one have to \u2018 express gender \u2019  plastic surgery  hormone shot  and crossdressing and make up  Women \u2019 s shoe  or tight jean and top  or be unisex clothing and an attitude enough to qualify for preferential treatment  I \u2019 m not sure why Chandler feel that the right to pee be preferential tratment  but my understanding of the New York City law be that there be no standard for gender expression  It be entirely the choice of the pisser a to which bathroom they prefer  I \u2019 m not even sure that they have to identify a transgender  transsexual or anything else  You be male travel or shop with you daughter or granddaughter and two slight young men dress somewhat unisex follow her into what may be an other wise empty lady room  or woman \u2019 s changing room  You can try to talk to her from outside the door  but you be not dress to go in  If you do and the shemales have do nothing  yet   will the law be on their side that your bigotry have you harass them    Yes  Why wouldn \u2019 t your first assumption be that these \u201c men \u201d need to pee  If you can talk to your daughter or granddaughter  couldn \u2019 t you continue talk to her to make sure she \u2019 s safe  and only go in if she sound like she \u2019 s in danger  What would you do if you saw an obviously drunk or insane woman who look dangerous follow your daughter into the bathroom  Maybe an end to gendersegregated bathroom be the solution  How will you warn your young coed about keep her guard up when she be at school with friendly young men she might meet at a bar or party  who be \u2018 express \u2019 themselves a woman  without be see a a wellmeaning bigot to be ignore  How about just generally teach her to take care of herself and not put herself in compromise situation with anyone she doesn \u2019 t know well  Do we still regard \u2018 peep Toms \u201d and men who collect steal woman \u2019 s underwear a potential rapist  What happen when we encourage such men to express a woman  for a near free pas to indulge their vice  I disagree with the premise that bathroom right represent \u201c encouragement \u201d to express a woman  If it be  on any level  a my Nexis search show  none of them have be encourage  Like most of the rightwing fearmongers  Chandler doesn \u2019 t seem to be aware that the law guarantee equal right to bathroom have be on the book for several year in New York City  and largely respect by the NYPD  and no peep tom or panty raider have be \u201c encourage \u201d in that way  When do we become hate filled villain for have such concern  Good question  It start when you stop see transpeople a human being who sometimes just need to pee  shit and wash their face  and deserve a minimum of respect  It continue when you express no desire to understand why we would be willing to risk harassment  arrest or violence in order to present a our target gender  Should we be inform enough to know to ask such question  and to expect an answer before we elect a candidate for governor who may be a strong influence on this issue  one way or another  Or do this continue to be allow to slip in under the radar until it be too late to have any influence  Absolutely the first  If the trans community be interested in slip our agenda  s  in under the radar  do you think we \u2019 d really have have a rally outside of Grand Central Station and invite the press  In fact  you should be so wellinformed that you learn that for whatever reason  peep Toms  rapist and child molester just don \u2019 t seem interested in present a woman  That \u2019 s all the question that Chandler have  But I \u2019 ve get a little more to say on the \u201c hate fill villain \u201d issue  Chandler \u2019 s photograph show that he \u2019 s a black man  and that remind me of another time when his ancestor be similarly see a predator and potential rapist  That portrayal be use to justify discrimination  segregation  harassment and much  much bad  warn  more graphic description of violence   I think at this point we all agree that the author of the Jim Crow law and the leader of the lynch mob be in fact hatefilled villians  right  ", "feedtitle": "Page 20
