argument  It \u2019 s an ageold expression of power  the right to decide which categories people get put in  who belong and who doesn \u2019 t  who be condemn and who be spar  who be mock and who be praise  These argument be compound by the problem that we human have in categorize anything in a way that we can agree on  Last week I have a chance to talk with George Lakoff  who have do a lot to raise awareness of the problem with traditional definition of category  and he agree that these problem have a great impact when it come to categorize people  Because of this  I generally try to avoid talk about transgender people  and instead focus on trans feeling  belief and action  Unfortunately  the rest of the trans world hasn \u2019 t see the value in this  and keep argue about how to categorize people  One of the bad thing people do be to apply their category uncritically to people from other culture at other time  without their approval or consent  This come up a few day ago when someone call Nat tweet this  The Stonewall Riots be 44 year ago today  Let s all remember they be start by trans woman of colour  not rich white dude in suit  \u2014 TheNatFantastic   TheNatFantastic  June 28  2013 As Nat explain to me  the target of this tweet be the organization Stonewall UK  which be apparently run by a bunch of rich white dude in suit  I agree that it \u2019 s problematic for an organization call Stonewall to be run by people who don \u2019 t look anything like the people who start the Stonewall Riots  but I object to Nat \u2019 s use of \u201c trans woman \u201d to describe the actual rioter  The people who start the Stonewall Riots do not call themselves \u201c trans woman of color \u201d \u201c Trans woman \u201d be a recent coinage  from the past ten year  and \u201c of color \u201d be only slightly old  If they want to categorize themselves by race they be \u201c black \u201d  maybe \u201c Negro \u201d  and \u201c Puerto Rican  \u201d and if they categorize themselves by gender expression they be \u201c transvestite \u201d and \u201c queens \u201d After the riot  the organization that Sylvia Rivera found be call the Street Transvestites Action Network   She later change it to Street Transgender Action Network  but never to anything contain the term \u201c trans women \u201d  Rioters at the Stonewall Inn  1969The problem with refer to the Stonewall activist a \u201c trans woman \u201d be that that category be reserve for transitioners  Some of the Stonewall veteran have partly transition  and some transition later  include Rivera   but many live part time and never transition  Would they transition if they be in their teen and twenty today  Maybe  maybe not  Nat tweet to me  \u201c I be under the impression that trans include vestite  \u201d Yes  trans include vestite  \u201c Trans woman \u201d do not \u2013 except when they \u2019 re coopting u to get money or political support  When have you ever hear \u201c trans woman \u201d use to describe someone who \u2019 s not transition  RuPaul have be explicitly exclude from the category \u2013 and apart from be wealthy she probably bear the great resemblance to the Stonewall rioter of any celebrity today  If you can find a nontransitioner in any list of contemporary \u201c trans woman  \u201d I \u2019 d love to see it  I \u2019 ve never see Eddie Izzard or Rye Silverman in one  And in the few tweet I \u2019 ve read from  theNatFantastic  I \u2019 ve never see a contemporary nontransitioner a a trans woman  So no  you don \u2019 t get to go around talk about \u201c trans woman \u201d never mention a nontransitioner  and then turn around and claim nontransitioning hero a \u201c trans women \u201d The Stonewall rioter be not trans woman  They be transvestite  They \u2019 re my hero  not yours  Here \u2019 s the kicker  which prompt Nat to tell me to \u201c chill the fuck out \u201d  there be a systematic exclusion of nontransitioners from the \u201c trans community  \u201d and \u201c trans woman \u201d leader be actively involve in this exclusion  \u201c Trans woman \u201d be do exactly the same thing a Nat \u2019 s \u201c rich white dude in suits \u201d Nat \u2019 s tweet be part of this exclusion  Maybe it \u2019 s because I sometimes look like a white dude in a suit  but I \u2019 ve find a lot more acceptance and support from rich white dude in suit than I ever have from \u201c trans woman  \u201d many of whom be rich and white and wear suit  Let \u2019 s all remember that the Stonewall Riots be start by Black and Puerto Rican transvestite  Their legacy belongs to the world  but more to Black people  Puerto Ricans and transvestite than to the rest of u  And most of all to Black and Puerto Rican transvestite  who still flock to Greenwich Village to this day  Maybe we should let them decide what to do with it  ", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
