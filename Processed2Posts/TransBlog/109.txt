real  She describe a torrent of negative comment direct at DJ Mister Cee in response to a revelation Wednesday that he have try to have sex with a trans prostitute  and list a number of other entertainer who have be publicly sham for action as simple a pose for a picture with a trans fan  I \u2019 ve get problem with the way that a number of people be try to spin the incident with Mister Cee  include Mock  Bimbo Winehouse and Mister Cee himself  but that \u2019 s for another post  DJ Mister CeeTonight I want to focus on Mock \u2019 s vision of trans acceptance  It \u2019 s an incomplete vision  but it have farranging implication  so it deserve to be explore  It begin with her move story about disclose her trans status to her boyfriend  and his decision to accept her  which you should definitely read if you haven \u2019 t already  Mock go on to say that her boyfriend Aaron be constantly challenge by others on his love for her  Our relationship be marvel at largely because most people do not believe that a man like Aaron should have to \u201c compromise \u201d his heteronormative social standing by be with a trans woman or a woman who be not \u201c real \u201d It be rare for an openly trans woman \u2013 no matter how \u201c passable \u201d or attractive she be \u2013 to have a man who openly love her  who have an unabashed desire to be see with her  who proudly stand beside her \u2014 despite the stigma and other people \u2019 s curiosity and inappropriate question  Those question regard Aaron \u2019 s sexuality be constant and fraught with assumption that this essay can \u2019 t begin to unpack  and for a man less secure it can be difficult navigate these question  especially if you also perceive the woman you \u2019 re attract to a shameful  a lessthanhuman object you must keep secret at all cost  She then articulate her vision  It \u2019 s important that we begin truly accept trans woman a who they be  woman  We be not object to have secret sex with  to discard and to laugh at on the radio or the gossip blogosphere  We be worthy of be see and be not dirty or shameful  Until we begin check how we delegitimize the identity  body and existence of trans woman and stigmatize the men who yearn to be with u  we will continue to marginalize our sister  push them far into sociallysanctioned invisibility  leave in the dark to fend for themselves with men who be don \u2019 t have the space to explore  define and embrace their attraction to various woman  As Mock acknowledge  her \u201c passability \u201d give her some advantage in dating  but she want other \u201c trans woman \u201d to have the same advantage regardless of passability  When she say  \u201c their attraction to various woman  \u201d she \u2019 s imagine a culture where transness be see a just a possible trait that a woman can have  like green eye or broad hip or freckle  and attraction to trans woman be a simple matter of taste  I want to explore this vision and move a little past the scenario of her relationship with Aaron and the scenario of DJ Mister Cee and Bimbo Winehouse  to this scene of flirtation  PAUL be hang out with his friend  Steve and Dave  They \u2019 re laughing  chat  catch up  All of a sudden PAUL stop for just a brief moment a he catch sight of a woman he \u2019 s never meet  He slip away from his friend and go to chat with her  After a few minute he return  STEVE  So  do you get her number  PAUL  Oh yeah  I get it  She \u2019 s cute  right  STEVE  Eh  She \u2019 s get green eye  I saw them as soon a she look up  PAUL  So  That \u2019 s a bonus  Green eye be hot  STEVE  They don \u2019 t do it for me  Not into green eye  DAVE  I \u2019 m not that into green eye either  Steve  but do you see her smile  With a sweet smile like that her eye could be purple for all I care  STEVE  Whatever  She \u2019 s all yours  Paul  Maybe tonight I \u2019 ll find me a nice browneyed girl  Replace \u201c she \u2019 s get green eye \u201d with \u201c she \u2019 s trans  \u201d and you have Mock \u2019 s vision for men flirt with trans woman  The men see trans woman a just a kind of woman that some guy like  Liking trans woman doesn \u2019 t make the guy gay  There be no danger of humiliation  discrimination  or physical attack  There be nothing for them to fear  The setup for the scene may be familiar to you  because it \u2019 s base on what happen right before Islan Nettles be murder  This be another way the story could have turn out  if the culture have be different  As I say  I have some problem with this vision  I \u2019 ll talk about them later  For now  I think it \u2019 s very positive that someone \u2013 Janet Mock \u2013 have articulate an alternative to murder  a vision of how thing could be good  That \u2019 s important  ", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
