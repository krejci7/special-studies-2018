Queens there be bar show RuPaul \u2019 s Drag Race  The answer be a bar call Hombres  At gay bar and other place explicitly mark a male space  you \u2019 ll often find not just drag fan but drag queen  transvestite and other nontransitioning trans people  You will also find that when we get home from these space we usually take off the makeup and falsie and look a lot like men  Sometimes we change into guy clothes before we leave the bar  Sometimes we wear guy clothes the whole time  This guyness extends to other environment  We usually present a guy at our day job  when we \u2019 re do laundry  and when we go hike  Interacting with the world a woman be a relatively small part of our life  This be often use by transitioned trans woman to deny that we be trans  and thus to deny u a voice in transgender politics  In 2014 there be a heated debate over who have the right to declare word like \u201c tranny \u201d taboo  RuPaul and other drag queen saw the word a either not particularly offensive or ripe for reclamation  while a group of transitioners saw them a potent slur  The transitioners be use to have the upper hand in these verbal hygiene debate by virtue of ideology of linguistic selfdetermination  in which only member of a group have stand to determine which word be appropriate name for the group and it member  and which word be offensive  But the drag queen have long be consider part of the \u201c transgender umbrella \u201d with equal standing to transition trans people  The transitioners \u2019 response be to redefine \u201c trans women \u201d Zinnia Jones write a petition state that \u201c Cisgender male drag queen be assign male at birth  and they neither consider themselves to be woman nor live a woman in their everyday life  Unlike trans woman  they be not the one who regularly face the consequence of widespread transphobia and transmisogyny  and they be not confront with the fallout of normalize transmisogynist slurs \u201d It \u2019 s highly debatable whether people who regularly go to drag bar face less transphobia than people who be out during the day  but victimhood wasn \u2019 t originally part of the definition of transgender  and it shouldn \u2019 t be  It \u2019 s also not clear that drag queen don \u2019 t consider themselves to be woman  I \u2019 ve never be to Hombres but if it \u2019 s anything like the gay bar I \u2019 ve be to  chance be that inside you \u2019 ll probably hear all the drag queen  and even some of the more masculinepresenting people  refer to with \u201c she \u201d pronoun and in Spanish  feminine adjective  This may occasionally be a mockery of femininity  but most of the time it be a response to a simple desire to be classify a woman in a particular situation  Some people have observe that it be relatively common for people to spend month or year live a men and perform in drag show  and then later transition to living a woman  for a variety of reason  That be only part of the story  Many drag queen and other trans woman have decide that we don \u2019 t want to transition  When people be allow to be free with our gender  we choose what work for u  from one column or another  Drag queen go to bar call Hombres and answer to \u201c she \u201d I buy nylon for woman and razor for men  I have friend who buy jacket for men and bra for woman  Everyone mix and match on some level  So be we transgender  Are we trans woman  The key fact in my mind be that many of u experience one or both of the key feeling of gender dysphoria  in our case  discomfort living a men  or transgender desire  want to live a woman   The fact that we cope with these feeling without adopt a fulltime identity a a woman or modify our body do not mean that we don \u2019 t feel the feeling  If you force u to choose one gender and stick with it  we will probably say we \u2019 re men  and there \u2019 s a good reason for it  We \u2019 ve get these body and we \u2019 re not change them  and on some level we \u2019 re use to live a men  We probably also know  maybe from firsthand experience  that be a woman be no picnic either  If you know that you \u2019 re not go to transition  and you \u2019 re go to spend eighty percent  ninety percent of your life or more interacting with the world a a man  and if someone force you to choose whether to think of yourself a a man or a woman  it make sense to choose man  That mean your internal selfimage and your external selfimage match for most of your week  So yes  we call ourselves men  but that be because our binary society pressure u to choose men or woman  It do not mean that we \u2019 re always happy be men  and it doesn \u2019 t mean that we wouldn \u2019 t choose both if we could  or whichever one fit at the time  ", "feedtitle": "Trans Blog"}
