and Human Services have just make a big announcement  they will begin collect data on LGBT issue  include transgender issue  The goal be to document disparity in health care  as well a plain old disparity in health  so that they can be address in the future  The plan be to have two roundtable on \u201c gender identity data collection \u201d with \u201c key expert \u201d this summer and fall  and then the \u201c Data Council \u201d will present a strategy next spring  The department will also collect public comment in various way  one be through a website call regulationsgov  which be currently down  If do right  this could be a tremendous help to understanding transgender issue  \u201c The first step be to make sure we be ask the right question  \u201d HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius tell the Washington Post  \u201c Sound data collection take careful plan to ensure that accurate and actionable data be be recorded \u201d As I \u2019 ve write before  current research on transgender feeling and action be severely hamper by the lack of any kind of representative sample  Just to give you a quick sense  here be ten very basic question that nobody know the answer to  How many transgender people be there  How common be the various transgender thought  feeling and belief  How common be transgender action like crossdressing  body modification  and \u201c soft mod \u201d like shave  How common be transgender name and pronoun change  How common be parttime crossliving and full time transition  How often be sexual activity part of transgender activity  How common be disease and destructive habit among transgender population  How many transgender people be in longterm relationship  How often be various subgroup target by violence and discrimination  How satisfied be transsexual twenty  thirty or forty year posttransition  Unfortunately  transgender research be dominate by two camp  the pathologist who make unfounded generalization base on case study of their own patient  and the social service provider who make unfounded generalization base on service recipient  Internet survey and word of mouth  Neither of them seem to have understand the idea that while convenience sample can provide the basis for many useful existential statement  prevalence statement base on unrepresentative sample be worthless  At this point it look like the roundtable will be heavily influence by social service provider who only pay lip service to the limitation of their research  The Plan say  \u201c While HHS be in the beginning stage of develop data collection on gender identity  many researcher  eg  Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles and the Center for Population Research in LGBT Health at the Fenway Institute  have be work on such data collection for several years \u201d The Williams Institute produce report like \u201c Bias in the Workplace \u201d  PDF   an important summary of numerous study investigate workplace discrimination that repeatedly acknowledge that the study be base on convenience sample \u2013 and then go ahead and repeat percentage result a though they mean something  The Fenway Institute employ transgender health advocate Emilia Dunham a a Program Associate  and she also host a webinar on the issue  It seem quite likely that she will be one of the expert at the roundtable  But in an otherwise solid article for Bay Windows present these change at Health and Human Services  Dunham uncritically repeat several of these unsupported percentage  There be a very short list of Experts who I think should be on these Roundtables  The strong research into transgender issue have be qualitative research  listening  reading and introspection  find existential statement but not make unsupported claim of prevalence  I \u2019 ve say before that the best qualitative researcher in the transgender community be Helen Boyd  author of My Husband Betty  At Helen \u2019 s recommendation I \u2019 ve also read a few thing by Raven Kaldera that have be pretty good  particularly his post on female transvestite  which have somehow disappear from his website   There be only one person out there who have ever collect data from a representative sample of any transgender community  and that \u2019 s Niklas L\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m of the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden  He \u2019 s not focus on the transgender community  and he \u2019 s associate with the pathologist Kenneth Zucker  who be not someone we want involve   but he do know how to do a national survey  and it would be worth every penny for HHS to fly him over from Stockholm for the Roundtables  If they can \u2019 t get L\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m  then I want to be on that Roundtable  I don \u2019 t have a degree in psychology or public health  but I do take an elementary course in statistic  and I learn what you have to do in order to make a generalization  But what matter more than any qualification be that I care about do this right  If they can \u2019 t find anyone else who do  I want to be there  Am I miss anyone  Are you do quality quantitative research  Please let me know  ", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
