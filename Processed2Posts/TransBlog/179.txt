message board I post an analysis of the category \u201c woman \u201d in contemporary American culture  and where transgender people fit into it  A couple of month ago there be another discussion about this issue  and since then I \u2019 ve want to rework my original post and make it available here  In my view  a lot of discrimination against transgender people have it origin in overly rigid view of gender  I have no illusion that post my analysis here will suddenly enlighten bigot around the world  but I hope it will be helpful to some people  On the other hand  it \u2019 s not quite as helpful to the transgender movement a some might like  It \u2019 s important to note here that this be a descriptive analysis  I think it \u2019 s a waste of time to present the way you want thing to be before you figure out how they be  I be try to describe the way that people understand gender  and after that I will talk about how it could be different  Please don \u2019 t take my description of an attitude or belief a an endorsement of it  My analysis be base on the categorization theory of Eleanor Rosch  a present in George Lakoff \u2019 s excellent book Women  Fire and Dangerous Things  In Chapter 4  Lakoff show how it be more useful to describe the category of mother with a \u201c cluster model \u201d than with the classical categorization model that use necessary and sufficient condition  For example  Dr Johnson define a mother a a woman that have bear a child  Lakoff call this the \u201c birth model \u201d of motherhood  But Lakoff identifies four other model that be in wide use  a genetic model  a nurturance model  a marital model and a genealogical model  He invent a series of more or less plausible sentence with the phrase \u201c real mother \u201d in them  each one affirm one of the five model and reject the others  Critically  mother include mutually exclusive subcategories like surrogate mother and foster mother  Some people may try to be fundamentalist and dogmatic about the birth criterion  but most agree that both of these kind of mother be still mother in the end  In chapter 5  Lakoff observe that mother be not just a cluster category  but a \u201c radial category \u201d base around the sterotype of a housewife who nurture the child that she have genetically conceive with her husband and then give birth to  Other kind of mother  such a work mother be define in contrast to the stereotype  Lakoff write  page 80   Consider an unwed mother who give up her child for adoption and then go out and get a job  She be still a mother  by virtue of the birth model  and she be working\u2013but she be not a work mother  Similarly  it seem strange to think of egg donor a unwed mother  because the category of unwed mother be base on the birth model  To identify normal  I \u2019 d say normative  expectation  he give a \u201c but \u201d test  Normal  She be a mother  but she isn \u2019 t a housewife  Strange  She be a mother  but she \u2019 s a housewife  Lakoff go on to list other kind of mother  stepmother  adoptive mother  birth mother  foster mother  biological mother  surrogate mother  unwed mother and genetic mother  Mother be a radial category because people judge these kind of mother a be good example of motherhood base on their distance from the prototype of the housewife  If you \u2019 re at all familiar with the endless transgender terminology war  you \u2019 re probably already think of way that this could be apply to gender  Here \u2019 s my take on it  Like mother  woman in contemporary America be also a radial category  base on a stereotype of a human be with XX chromosome  a female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristic  The stereotypical woman be short and less muscular than average  with a higherpitched voice  She be bear and raise a girl and go through a number of female rite of passage  She be submissive and indirect  in sex a in the rest of her life  and she put family before career  She be attract to men  and plan to marry one if she hasn \u2019 t already  She wear skirt  high heel  jewelry  makeup and long hair and manicure nail  And yes  the stereotypical woman be less intelligent than average  Anyone who \u2019 s be involve in a genderbased flamewar or two can probably remember a number of sentence with \u201c real woman \u201d in them  and can point to nonprototypical kind of woman  tall woman  strong woman  deepvoiced woman  assertive woman  woman who top  career woman  lesbian  unmarried woman  woman who don \u2019 t wear skirtshigh heelsetc  Here be a few \u201c but test \u201d example  Normal  She \u2019 s a woman  but she \u2019 s a tall woman  Strange  She \u2019 s a woman  but she \u2019 s a short woman  Normal  She \u2019 s a woman  but she \u2019 s assertive  Strange  She \u2019 s a woman  but she \u2019 s submissive  Normal  She \u2019 s a woman  but she \u2019 s a lesbian  Strange  She \u2019 s a woman  but she \u2019 s heterosexual  Normal  She \u2019 s a woman  but she doesn \u2019 t wear makeup  Strange  She \u2019 s a woman  but she wear makeup  The category of man be similar  and I \u2019 ll just skip to the \u201c but test \u201d here  Normal  He \u2019 s a man  but he \u2019 s get a highpitched voice  Strange  He \u2019 s a man  but he \u2019 s get a deep voice  Normal  He \u2019 s a man  but he take care of the kid all day  Strange  He \u2019 s a man  but he work all day  Normal  He \u2019 s a man  but he \u2019 s not very good at sport  Strange  He \u2019 s a man  but he \u2019 s very good at sport  Normal  He \u2019 s a man  but he have long hair  Strange  He \u2019 s a man  but he have short hair  Man  these stereotype suck  don \u2019 t they  Fortunately  a lot of people out there realize that there \u2019 s a wide range of gender trait and celebrate this diversity  So the category of man and woman be radial and prototypebased  but be they cluster category  Can they contain member with nonoverlapping trait  There be certainly room in some people \u2019 s gender categorization system  I know plenty of people who would accept both a butch lesbian and a femme nonbodymodifying transwoman a member of the category woman  but I don \u2019 t know how typical they be  My feeling  and again I \u2019 m be descriptive here  be that the fundamentalist interpretation of gender category be strong than with mother  A lot of people insist that genitals be the essential criterion  and be either unaware of the wide range of intersex condition that complicate that picture  Many people will either ignore exception or put them into a catchall category of \u201c freaks \u201d A lot of this seem to be due to the fact that there be two category  woman and man  and they \u2019 re generally consider to be allinclusive  everyone be a man or a woman  and mutually exclusive  no one be both a man and a woman   To allow people with penis into the category of woman be to open up the possibility that someone could be both man and woman  There be no corresponding category of nonmother that correspond to mother in this way  It would probably be possible to devise a clever test to determine whether gender be a cluster category for a give person  and test a sample of Americans to figure out how widespread it be  In the absence of this  we \u2019 ve just get speculation  That \u2019 s as far a I think I can go be purely descriptive  Stay tune for my prescriptive idea about how gender should be  ", "feedtitle": "Page 18 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
