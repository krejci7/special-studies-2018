transvestite  drag queen  drag king  butch lesbian  genderqueer  nonbinary or something else  you almost certainly experience one of those feeling  and probably all three  Whatever neurological claim you may have read about essential difference between one group and another  the fact remain that almost none of the trans people you will meet have be find to have a \u201c female brain  \u201d neurologically  People cross those subcategory boundary all the time  and the only evidence currently accept for membership be personal declaration  We be the same  and yet we can be divide into two subgroup that be very different  with an essential conflict of interest between u that be impossible to erase  This difference be not base on biology or neurology  it be base on a simple difference of goal  Trans people who transition \u2013 who take a goal of become or be see a a different gender \u2013 be often at odds with trans people whose goal do not include transition  There be multiple conflict between transitioners and nontransitioners  but the most common  the most salient  conflict be over destiny  Transitioners tend to believe that it be their destiny to transition  and to interpret fact a evidence for that destiny  Nontransitioners may believe that it be our destiny not to transition  or we may be agnostic on that issue  For example  one time I be out with a friend  present a a woman  My friend remark to me  \u201c You \u2019 re not very feminine  be you  \u201d At first I be hurt  but then I saw he have a point  and I think to myself  \u201c Actually  I \u2019 m get tire of be a woman  and I \u2019 ll be glad when I can take this bra off and use my regular voice  Good thing I didn \u2019 t transition  \u201d In contrast  Lal Zimman interview trans men who report feeling devastate by the idea that they be fail a men  They couldn \u2019 t say  \u201c good thing I didn \u2019 t transition  \u201d because they do  Instead  they say thing like  \u201c I must just be a feminine man \u201d And you know what  I completely understand the value of the destiny argument  Transition be hard  I \u2019 ve know transitioners for whom it be pretty obvious to everyone that they be on the right path  but still they encounter some very daunting challenge  There be many people who be politically and philosophically oppose to transition  and who will fight you on it  possibly include parent  employer and medical professional  It \u2019 s hard to go through that constantly wonder if you \u2019 re do the right thing  The psychologist Dan Gilbert talk about an experiment where people who felt that they be stick with a possession  an artistic print  decide that they like it good than people who think they could exchange it  When we \u2019 re stick with something \u2013 and it \u2019 s something we can live with \u2013 we make peace with it  When we can change it at any time  the grass be always greener  Marriage work in similar way  If you \u2019 re commit to a person it help to believe that you \u2019 re destine for them  and if you \u2019 re commit to transition it \u2019 s helpful to believe that you \u2019 re destine to transition  The conflict come in when people start make universal destiny argument  like the idea that \u201c trans woman be woman  \u201d not just when present a woman  but essentially  eternally  from birth through death  whether we transition or not  Transition then be portray a not a change of gender  but a reveal the \u201c real you  \u201d or your \u201c authentic self \u201d That imply that someone like me who choose not to transition be hide the real me  or deny my authentic self  And that be true for people who stay in the closet  but it \u2019 s not true for the rest of u  If we be not deny our authentic self  but we be still not transition  many conclude  we must not have that essence of womanhood  or manhood  that make transition such a necessity  And that lead to bizarre twist of logic  where someone can be a \u201c man who like to wear dress \u201d one day  and be see a essentially and forever male  and the next day declare a transition and be see a essentially and forever female  This essentialist view of nontransitioners lead people to declare that we be not truly trans  and therefore not part of LGBT  It lead them to deny the very real feeling of gender dysphoria  transgender desire and gender fog that we continue to feel  and to deny u any need for support or service  It lead them to speak on behalf of all transgender people  set priority and make declaration about terminology without any regard to our very real need  Transgender essentialism also lead people to marginalize and ignore nontransitioners  Because the choice not to transition result in people tend to become less passable over time  nontransitioners be caricature a embarrassing  and negative characteristic that be find across the transgender spectrum be push into caricature of crossdresser and drag queen a big clumsy insensitive objectify men in short skirt  and of transmasculine genderqueer people a childish \u201c transtrenders \u201d who claim gender variance only to attract attention  Detransitioners be usually kick right out of the transgender club  The fact that they weren \u2019 t happy with their transition lead many people  include many detransitioners themselves  to declare that they be \u201c never really trans \u201d in the first place  But of course the feeling of dysphoria and desire and fog don \u2019 t vanish  and the detransitioners be leave to cope with them with very little support  In short  the essentialist way of think about trans issue be a big problem for nontransitioners and detransitioners  I use to think that it be just confine to a particular subgroup  and I have friend  many of them nontransitioning trans people  who be skeptical of it  But then a funny thing happen  Many of these friend transition  and a each one begin to commit to build new life in a new gender they and their family start repeat essentialist claim  Each time I hear one of these claim I object  but the result be that over time they begin to think of me a a combative stickler  This pattern be repeat in most of my interaction with transitioners  I use to take some of this personally  but now I realize that the transitioners be just protect their interest  They don \u2019 t seem to be capable of realize how much their action threaten my interest  this kind of egotism be a hallmark of gender fog   and thus they tend to dismiss my complaint a cranky contrarianism  It be not cranky contrarianism  It be the one essential difference between trans people who transition and those who don \u2019 t  transitioners have an interest in justify transition  and nontransitioners often have an interest in justify not transition  It be not biology  it be simple psychology  Can we still be friend  Yes  despite this difference  we have many of the same feeling  and many of the same need  We face many of the same danger  and we inhabit many of the same space  I have friend who have transition or be transition  and I respect their choice about what path to follow   That be all I can do  I can not accept that they have no choice  I think this be clear   There be room for u to form alliance of common interest  and alliance of the hearth  But there will always come a Yalta  a time when that essential conflict of interest will manifest itself  when the alliance will break down  Some people \u2013 Righteous Ones \u2013 will be able to put thing in perspective and sacrifice their own interest for someone with a great need  It will not always be obvious whose need be great  and we may take action that be at odds with each other \u2019 s interest  But what be absolutely critical be to acknowledge and respect them  If a transitioner tell me that something I do or say affect her interest  I may keep do it  but I will try to accept that the conflict exist and respect her interest  I ask the same from transitioners  If we all do that  there \u2019 s a chance we may be able to stay friend and keep the door open to future alliance  ",
