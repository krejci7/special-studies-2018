Data Collection Standards for Race  Ethnicity  Primary Language  Sex  and Disability Status Required by Section 4302 of the Affordable Care Act  Document ID HHSOMH201100130001  The deadline to submit your comment be Monday  August 1  2011  As a transgender person and a social scientist  I be excite to hear that HHS will be collect information relate to transgender phenomenon  These activity have the potential to bring u valuable information about the prevalence of transgender feeling  thought  belief and action in the general population  beyond an often selfselected community that identify a transgender and participates in the exist survey  As a social scientist I have some longstanding concern about the collection and presentation of survey data about transgender individual  and I hope that your work will improve the situation  Here be some recommendation that I have  for the process of decide what data to collect and how  and for the data collection itself  In my experience  many organization and agency work with transgender community repeatedly and consistently make generalization about transgender population that be unsupported by any data  For example  the Transgender Law Center find 194 transpeople through unrepresentative \u201c convenience \u201d technique  of whom 114 report annual income of less than  15333  A cover article in the San Francisco Bay Guardian summarize it a  \u201c In other word  more than half of local transgender people live in poverty \u201d \u2013 an incorrect characterization that be not dispute by the study author  As any introductory statistic textbook will tell you  prevalence in a convenience sample tell you nothing about prevalence in the general population  No one know if the sample be representative of \u201c local transgender people \u201d Presenting it a representative be mislead to the public and can lead to inappropriate funding allocation and badly target health initiative  and possibly even a backlash against transgender people  I believe that convenience sample can be very useful  for example to show the existence of job discrimination  poverty and prostitution in our community  There be a limit to their usefulness  however  and they be consistently use beyond that limit by social service provider and community advocate  The result be to spread unreliable information  and quite probably to waste taxpayer money and charitable contribution  Reports like this be often accompany by a disclaimer  the Bay Guardian article say  \u201c TLC doesn \u2019 t claim the study be strictly scientific \u2014 all respondent be identify through trans organization or outreach workers \u201d Unfortunately  they almost always go on to report the data a if the disclaimer be meaningless  the next sentence read  \u201c But the data give a fairly good picture of how hard it be for transgender people to find and keep decent job  even in the city that be suppose to be most accepting of them \u201d The reporting of percentage invite this kind of lip service to sample procedure  Percentages be meaningless in these situation  but they be always report  and the effect be to dismiss the disclaimer a a formality  encourage medium reporter to do the same  On your website I see that you anticipate that the Williams Institute and the Fenway Institute will play a strong role in help you formulate procedure for collect information on transgender community  I agree that they have do a lot of good work  and I support their inclusion in any round table that you convene  However  both institute have a history of present convenience sample a representative  I strongly recommend that you balance their participation with people who be knowledgeable about the appropriate use of sample  I be a strong advocate of qualitative research a a mean of find out problem that exist in the world  There be several advocate from the transgender community who have do quality ethnographic and autoethnographic work  One that I know personally be Gail Kramer  who have write the book My Husband Betty and She \u2019 s Not the Man I Married under the pseudonym Helen Boyd  I urge you to include in your Roundtables at least one qualitative researcher like Helen  To my knowledge  only one researcher have do a representative sample of any segment of the transgender community  That be Niklas L\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m of the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden  I strongly recommend that L\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m  or someone familiar with his survey  be part of your Roundtables  I be also willing to participate  a a transgender person interested in these issue and a a social scientist who have use representative sampling in my professional work  ", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
