something wrong with the configuration of the body  apart from any documented physical condition  It be often contrast with simple gender dysphoria  but some people instead portray gender dysphoria a a symptom of the same underlying condition  As I write a few year ago  there be an argument that body dysphoria be an innate \u201c medical condition \u201d deserve special protection  In that post I discuss multiple case of body dysphoria appear in adulthood  which contradict the idea that it be always innate  So if not everyone with body dysphoria be bear with it  how do those people get it  There be an alternative explanation for body dysphoria  base on the theory of semantic frame  that body dysphoria arise when gender dysphoria and transgender desire interact with the world  There be no reason to believe any of them be innate  I also want to note that body dysphoria seem to be frequently trigger by the presence of others  or at least by people imagine how others would see them  The symptom of body dysphoria \u2013 shock and distress \u2013 bear a strong resemblance to the feeling that many people feel when they be misgendered \u2013 classify by gender in a way that contradict their intention  The explanation that I give for body dysphoria also explain the reaction to misgendering  In fact  they be the same reaction  only with different trigger  The way I \u2019 ve present the concept in the past be that body dysphoria be a feeling of discomfort with the body  specifically the idea that there be something wrong with the body  that the way it appear be not the way it truly be or should be  By contrast  I \u2019 ve define gender dysphoria a a discomfort with gendered expectation impose by other people  I \u2019 ve also try to separate gender dysphoria from transgender desire  the desire to be see and accept a a member of a different gender  Many people experience all three feeling  but some people only experience one  What be frame  Cognitive psychologist have a theory that in our mind we organize a lot of our information about the world in frame  collection of information often tie to particular situation   Some prefer the term \u201c schema \u201d or \u201c script  \u201d which can have slightly different meaning  but the central idea be the same   The classic example be the restaurant frame  which contain object like a door  table and fork  people like a host  server and cook  and action like order  eat and pay  Frames be activate in our mind by direct experience  such a see the entrance to a restaurant  or the mention of certain word  As I write in my linguistics blog  we use frame to choose between multiple potential meaning  If we have the restaurant frame activate  we be likely to see a particular image in our mind when we hear a sentence like \u201c She put a check on the table \u201d But if instead someone have activate the bank frame in our mind  we get a very different picture  and the spreadsheet frame give u a completely different image  Frames be a way of understand our expectation for a particular situation  Some element of a frame be optional  a restaurant may not have liquor for sale  or large window  but many do  If a restaurant have no website  or seating  or gas line  we find it worth tell other people about  And what kind of restaurant doesn \u2019 t have restroom or water  or make sure their cup and plate be clean  or serve steak or cheeseburger or bake potato  Victor Raskin have a great book  and a short article  use frame to explain humor  He observe that most successful joke activate one frame during the setup and then abruptly reveal that the true frame be actually a different one  The shock of the frame change make u laugh  You can try this yourself with one of my favorite joke  \u201c A guy walk into a bar and say \u2018 Ow \u2019 \u201d There be a similar dynamic at work in horror story  political persuasion and many other genre of communication that rely on shock the audience  First set the stage by provide enough detail to invoke certain frame  then allow the audience to imagine the remain detail from those frame  Finally  reveal detail that tell the audience that the frame they have activate be wrong  along with many of the detail they have fill in base on those frame  Frames vary and change It \u2019 s important to note here that the shock andor discomfort arises from the clash between two frame  The first frame must be properly activate  or there be no shock  This be why so many people recognize the importance of the setup for joke  horror and persuasive rhetoric  It \u2019 s also important to note that while create frame may be innate  the content and organization of those frame be learn throughout the lifetime  And although most frame and their main element be generally share among many people in a society  there be wide variation across people and group  as well a change over time  To go back to the restaurant frame  when I be little the only restaurant that have television be sport bar  but now they be common in many other restaurant  Pubs  a subclass of restaurant that inherit many of the feature of restaurant  in the United States almost always have a server take order at the table  but in pub in the United Kingdom  the common expectation be that customer will order at the bar  An American joke base on customer order at their table would not work as well in Great Britain  and vice versa  Frames be sometimes form and change by instruction  but more often by repeat experience  as well a salient experience  An American who go to a pub in Great Britain may have read in a guidebook about order at the bar  but they will eventually get in the habit of it  It may take several experience of wait at the table to revise their frame  or one particularly unpleasant experience  They may find themselves order at the bar when back in the US  or forget again on a subsequent visit to the UK  and eventually create a separate \u201c British pub \u201d subframe  Frames for body Frames help u to organize all our experience and expectation  so it shouldn \u2019 t be surprise that they organize our experience of our body as well a other people \u2019 s body  When frame involve people be see and make contact  they encode expectation about those people \u2019 s body  We even have frame just for body  with their own set of expectation  Just a we would be shock if we go into a fancy restaurant and there be no chair or napkin  or if there be a giant television showing game show  many of u be shock to encounter body with less than two arm  or more than two ear  These body frame can vary and change just like frame for place or situation  When large number of people need limbs amputate during World War I  the people around them become more accustomed to body with amputated limb  People expect adult to be a certain height in Norway or Kenya  and a different height in Guatemala or Japan  The shock of unexpected body feature explain the entertainment value of \u201c the reveal \u201d of unexpected feature of other people \u2019 s body  such a hairlessness that be cover by a wig  a skin condition cover by makeup  a miss limb  even sometimes a different color skin \u2013 or in fiction  horn  fang or lizard skin  It also explain people \u2019 s shock at encounter a penis on someone take off a dress  or a vagina on someone with a beard  This shock be a major reason why trans people be so often the punch line in joke \u2013 and the monster in horror movie  After the shock  there be also often a further readjustment of understanding and expectation  which often produce longerlasting distress  In one wellknown film  can it be spoil at this point   the main character fall in love with a person in a dress and be then shock when his lover reveal a penis to him  He later go back to the club where he watch her sing  and notice other detail that make him recategorize it a a drag bar  If he love her  do this mean he have to recategorize himself a a gay man  What do this mean for his life  Frames and transgender feeling Now let \u2019 s imagine someone who experience gender dysphoria or transgender desire  Some people go through life feel one or both of these feeling  and never do anything about it  Some change their appearance to fit their image of their desired gender  for example through clothes  hair or hormone  but only for their own eye  or other sens   Some change their appearance and then interact with other people  Based on my own experience and many conversation with others  it be common for people to develop feeling of body dysphoria after change their appearance and interact with others  This bring me to Lydia K \u2019 s famous analogy between body dysphoria and fail Unix startup message  sd 7001  Attached scsi generic Phallus sg3 type 0 sd 7001   sdb  Attached Phallus sd 7001   sdb  hardware not support  use generic driver  partial support only

of body dysphoria \u2013 look for particular feature  fail to find them  and raise an alarm \u2013 be identical to what cognitive psychologist say happens when one frame be invalidate and replace with another  It seem likely that the person have establish a frame for body of their target gender that include specific sex characteristic  When those body part be not find  or unexpected part be encounter  they be force to invalidate that frame  produce a mental shock  Imagine a person act out of transgender desire  for example someone who \u2019 s be see a a man all her life but want others to see her a a woman  If she perceive a penis and invalidate a female body frame  that imply that she can \u2019 t even see herself a a woman  so how could she expect others to classify her a a woman  It \u2019 s clear why this would be very upsetting  Now imagine a person motivate by gender dysphoria  for example someone who have be see a a woman in the past  but desperately want to not be see a a woman  If they perceive a feature such a broad hip that be only compatible with their female body frame  that invalidate any other gendered frame and implies that they have fail to escape from be perceive a a woman  Again  it make sense why they would be upset  Third  imagine a person who have just be misgendered  He have tell his friend and family that he be a guy  and they use the name and pronouns he request  He have be out shop with a friend  wear a binder with slickedback hair  and be call \u201c sir \u201d Then they go to a restaurant  where the server greet them with \u201c Hello lady  \u201d He be shock by the greeting  and then feel awful  This person have establish a frame for \u201c guy in a restaurant  \u201d and put himself in the role of the guy  with all the expectation that go with it  When the server say \u201c lady  \u201d that invalidate the frame and impose one of \u201c lady in a restaurant \u201d Whether he be act out of gender dysphoria or transgender desire  or both  this frustrate his effort and leave him feel like a failure  In fact  we can think of body dysphoria a a form of unintentional selfmisgendering  Remember that body dysphoria happen more frequently  and with great distress  when the person know \u2013 or even imago \u2013 that someone else be present  Instead of be trigger by someone else \u2019 s word  it be trigger by their imagined word  or thought  Why this matter If frame be learn and then activate  this explain how body dysphoria can develop later in life  In order to experience the shock of the frame switch and the result distress  they must first have activate a frame with a space mark for their target gender  and put themselves in that space  This frame activation be not automatic  To the contrary  the intensity of the shock people experience be relate to what they expect to perceive  and the level of distress they feel be connect to the implication they draw from the new frame  These expectation and interpretation be not under complete conscious control  but a we have see in individual case  they can change in response to change in circumstance  and even in response to change in belief and attitude  This also offer a potential way to avoid  or at least minimize  the distress associate with body dysphoria and misgendering  If the severity of the shock come from violated expectation  we can look to anticipate and manage our expectation  and those of other people If the depth of distress come from contemplate the implication of a particular frame  we can anticipate that and avoid situation where the implication might be too distress  What do it mean to manage expectation  For one thing  it mean spending time around people who know and understand trans body and clothes  and ask our loved one to familiarize themselves with trans body and clothes  Managing expectation also mean take time on a regular basis to try and see our body a others might see them  It mean ask people we trust to filter their opinion less  I know this can be distress  but it \u2019 s a lot less distress in small dos with friend  under circumstance where we have more control  How can we avoid distress situation  We can think ahead when we be plan an activity  What could happen if someone notice this body part  or realize that I don \u2019 t have that body part  What could happen if someone misgenders me  Am I prepare to deal with this  For people who have make up their mind to transition  manage expectation and avoid distress situation mean plan your transition carefully  Some people I know like to play it by ear  tell people on a casebycase basis and let hormone change their body  This be nice in theory  but often lead to dysphoria  For people who haven \u2019 t decide  this mean be aware that experimentation can have serious consequence  If you \u2019 re aiming to determine what will help you deal with your current level of dysphoria  it \u2019 s important to avoid increase your level of dysphoria  That in turn mean choose your experiment carefully  and keep the frame dynamic in mind when interpret your experience  For people who have decide not to transition  this mean be aware of what practice might increase your level of dysphoria  and find activity that avoid both repression and dysphoria  I talk more about that in my long post on The Slippery Slope  The bottom line be this  we can \u2019 t control dysphoria  but we can anticipate and manage it to a significant degree  Every trans person need to know this and keep it in mind  ",
