change on official document  Some fight for access to responsible  professional medical care  or for hormone and surgery to be cover by insurance or government program  My main goal be for u to have access to bathroom and change space without get the shit beat out of u  And that \u2019 s why I \u2019 m ask you not to vote for Christine Quinn for Mayor of New York City  A trans woman walk into a McDonald \u2019 s and asks to use the woman \u2019 s bathroom  While she \u2019 s in there  someone yell at her \u201c I \u2019 m go to kill you  faggot \u201d She go out of the bathroom  and discovers that it be the store manager yell at her  and he hit her with a lead pipe  One of her friend call the police  but when they come they arrest the trans woman instead  on accusation from the store manager  Maybe this sound like something that happen in Texas  or Wyoming  but in 2006 a woman  Christina Sforza  claim that it happen to her right here in New York City  across from the Empire State Building  in the City Council district of Christine Quinn  Trans community leader and Amnesty International take the story seriously  The Sylvia Rivera Law Project put out an alert on October 11  2006  and I contact Quinn shortly after that  She do not have a public email address  so I contact her through a form on her Council website  I get no response for two week  until I get a broadcast email from Quinn \u2019 s office about a New Jersey Supreme Court decision on gay marriage  Frustrated  I reply to that email  only to get an autoreply tell me to fill out the form  I fill out the form again  and get an email from Quinn \u2019 s chief of staff say  \u201c I would love to hear more so that I could have a staff member work with you \u201d Encouraged  I write back with more detail  The Amnesty report say  \u201c Christine Quinn  New York City Council Speaker  reportedly intervene in October 2006 and Christina Sforza be finally able to file a criminal complaint \u201d I don \u2019 t know what this intervention be  but apparently nothing have come of it  Since then  I have hear nothing from Quinn \u2019 s office on this issue  I have  however  get regular email update  1 criticize the arrest of \u201c young transgender individual \u201d in the Port Authority bus terminal bathroom 1 support birth certificate gender change 1 support streamline transgender marriage bureaucracy 1 invite me to a \u201c Trans Reality Panel \u201d sponsor by the Empire State Pride Agenda 1 support GENDA  the state Gender NonDiscrimination Act 8 annual invitation to the Council LGBT Pride ceremony 1 invite me to my neighborhood LGBTinclusive Saint Patrick \u2019 s Day parade 3 on hate crime attack on gay men 1 on free selfdefense training 5 on Hurricane Sandy  include 1 on a \u201c LGBT Day of Action \u201d for Sandy victim  1 invite me to a hearing on the experience of LGBTQ youth in the juvenile justice system 1 praise a speech by Hilary Clinton on LGBT right 1 on a LGBT Advisory Committee to the NYPD 1 on LGBT right in Uganda 1 on LGBT right in Russia Every so often over the past seven year  I \u2019 ve try to think of some reason for Quinn \u2019 s silence on this issue  Did her staff find some reason to doubt Sforza \u2019 s story  Was there something else that make Sforza a difficult victim to champion  It doesn \u2019 t matter  We \u2019 ve heard Sforza \u2019 s story  and we know that trans people do get attack in bathroom \u2013 a we saw on video in Maryland in 2011  I be deeply unsettled to hear Sforza \u2019 s story  It could have be me  I \u2019 ve be in that McDonald \u2019 s  When we hear report of a horrific attack that could have happen to u  we want to know that justice be be do  Even if someone find out that Sforza make up the whole thing  it would still have be very reassure to have a statement from McDonald \u2019 s that that kind of behavior be not tolerate from their employee  I would feel much good to hear from the NYPD that they take our right seriously and will protect u if someone try to punish u for pee  I would like to know that someone on Quinn \u2019 s staff take my safety in her district as seriously a they do someone \u2019 s birth certificate or marriage license  or the right of people on the other side of the world  All the ceremony and parade be meaningless if we can \u2019 t use the bathroom without the fear of be beat  When Quinn be first elect I be excite at the news of our first out lesbian city council member  I know she care about lesbian right  and I hop that that would carry over to transgender right  I be disappoint  This be why I will not vote for Christine Quinn if I see her name on a ballot  and why I \u2019 m ask you to vote for anybody but her on September 10  We can do good  ", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
