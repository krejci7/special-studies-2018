A few month ago I lose a friend over pronoun  There be other factor  but the breaking point happen when this former friend be complain about a neighbor of ours  a trans woman  I agree that it sound like the woman be be a jerk  but after my former friend tell me the story  she call her \u201c it \u201d I ask her not to dehumanize our neighbor that way  thing escalate  and I haven \u2019 t talk to her since  I have to change a number of regular routine to avoid my former friend  and the whole experience be very upsetting  but I would do it again in an instant  All for a neighbor who \u2019 s never say a word to me  Sometimes pronoun be a big deal  I mention this now because there \u2019 s another case that \u2019 s a lot less clearcut  Last week I go to the vigil for Islan Nettles  who be murder in Harlem  I \u2019 ve be try to figure out how life like hers could be save in the future  but Janet Mock be worry about pronoun  and her post have be go around the net  so I want to respond to it  My heart drop each time I watch your face cringe with each misgendering  This be more than semantics  more than a family issue  this be our life  We all know Islan be beat to death because she fight hard to be Islan  to be she  to be her  We don \u2019 t all know that  I didn \u2019 t know that at the time  so I ask    SmartAssJen  JanetMock I d appreciate it if people who object to Nettles be call  he  give proof that Nettles herself object to it  \u2014 Angus B GrieveSmith   grievesmith  August 28  2013 Jen Richards be angry    grievesmith  janetmock Islan be murder because she be a trans woman  Your call for proof  be a distraction and hurtful  Stop  \u2014 Jen Richards   SmartAssJen  August 28  2013 Laverne Cox tell the Huffington Post  I know a a trans woman  and I think so many trans woman in the audience understand  that when we \u2019 re misgendered  that be an act of violence for u  It \u2019 s a part of the violence that lead to Islan \u2019 s death  No  Misgendering can be a whole range of thing  from an honest mistake to incitement to violence  but in itself it be not an act of violence  It \u2019 s not part of the cause of Islan Nettles \u2019 death  Nettles be not murder because she be a trans woman  Here \u2019 s what the New York Post report  Paris Wilson  20  be say to have make a pas at Nettles and be shock to learn she be not bear a woman  source say  Humiliated in front of his crew  Wilson then get into a heated argument with Nettles and the other woman  hurl derogatory slur at the group  The two eventually come to blow  but Wilson eventually overpower Nettles  beat her to a pulp  source say  The problem with Richards \u2019 s argument \u2013 and with Mock \u2019 s \u2013 be that you don \u2019 t have to use female pronoun for this to happen to you  It happen to B Scott in 2009  I be just call a faggot by Lewis Dix Jr of the Jamie Foxx  Foxxhole radio show because he saw me and be confusedattracted   \u2026  people don \u2019 t know what gays like me go thru  he come from across the room to speak to me cuz he be attract and then I say I be a man  If this have be at a different kind of party \u2013 if it have happen on the corner of 148th and Bradhurst  with a violent enough person \u2013 B Scott might have be kill that night  It wouldn \u2019 t have be because he be a trans woman  because Scott call himself a man right then  It wouldn \u2019 t have be because of pronoun  because Scott doesn \u2019 t reject \u201c he \u201d pronoun  Scott have recently begin identifying a trans  and a few week ago I give prop to Mock for accept him a such  even when Monica Roberts wouldn \u2019 t  But she stop short of identify him a a \u201c trans woman \u201d My wife point out that this happen to nontrans woman a well  If a man find out that a woman he \u2019 s attract to be lesbian or that she not interested in him  or if she respond in the \u201c wrong \u201d way  he can feel humiliated and take it out on her  There \u2019 s a whole range between B Scott \u2019 s 2009 presentation and pronoun and Janet Mock \u2019 s current presentation and pronoun  Ultimately  the \u201c right \u201d pronoun be not the matter of faith that Mock make them out to be  It \u2019 s not \u201c trans woman \u201d  \u201c she \u201d pronoun  It \u2019 s what the person want  It \u2019 s respectful to use \u201c she \u201d pronoun for Chelsea Manning because Chelsea Manning tell her lawyer to tell everyone to use \u201c she \u201d pronoun  Some people want one set of pronoun  some want another  some don \u2019 t care  When I present a a woman I prefer \u201c she \u201d pronoun  but if I be kill in a dress I would expect  and prefer  that my family and most of my friend would use \u201c he \u201d pronoun  because that \u2019 s how they \u2019 ve know me  From what I \u2019 ve hear it sound like Nettles \u2019 pronoun preference be close to Mock \u2019 s  but it \u2019 s not obvious that she would have object to anyone use \u201c he \u201d pronoun  especially not her family  and maybe not even a certain wellmeaning but clueless Gay Man of African Descent  That \u2019 s why I ask for some evidence that she care  Here we have someone who wasn \u2019 t murder for pronoun and didn \u2019 t necessarily object to her family use \u201c he \u201d pronoun  We have a family who say they \u2019 re ready to fight for justice and community leader who say they want safety for all  The intent of the pronoun user matter as well  When my former friend refer to our neighbor a \u201c it  \u201d I could hear the hate in her voice  In Delores Nettles we have a woman who have show she be ready to fight for justice for her child  and we tell her that she \u2019 s not do it right because she say \u201c he be a beautiful woman  \u201d instead of \u201c she be a beautiful woman \u201d  Those of you who be put the focus on pronoun  I want to know how you think pronoun be the solution  You \u2019 ve already school Vaughn Taylor  Suppose that tomorrow you could get everyone on that stage  in that park  to switch to \u201c she \u201d pronoun forever  just the way you want  Suppose you could do that for everyone in Harlem  in New York  in the whole country  What would that accomplish  Please tell me how \u201c she \u201d pronoun would have save Islan Nettles \u2019 life  when so many unquestioned \u201c shes \u201d have be kill in Harlem  I \u2019 m look forward to your evidence  I \u2019 ve get a PhD in language change  and I \u2019 d be happy to help guide your research if you need it  I completely understand if Mock  Richards and a lot of other trans people be carry away by the anger and frustration they felt at the moment  But if we want to actually solve this problem and save life in the future  we have to put the pronoun issue in perspective  This be not about pronoun  or about be accept a woman  This be a danger for transitioned trans woman like Nettles  but not for trans woman alone  Trans woman don \u2019 t own Islan Nettles \u2019 murder  they don \u2019 t own murder of gendernonconforming people  and they don \u2019 t own murder of woman  Transitioned trans woman don \u2019 t know how to make Harlem safe  and they don \u2019 t have the right to dictate other people \u2019 s response to this tragic killing  I hope that Mock and Cox will back off the pronoun agenda and refocus their effort on building safe  welcome community for all woman and gendernonconforming people  And I hope that everyone who \u2019 s reblogged and link Mock \u2019 s post will now reread the New York Post \u2018 s description of the event lead up to the murder of Islan Nettles \u2013 or any other detailed account \u2013 and try to think of one thing that might have prevent it  And write that up  too  Thanks  ", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
