friend join u for dinner  Enjoying their company in an overtly Jewish context help to defuse potential prejudice  and the specific activity of the night  the retelling of the story of slavery in Egypt and our exodus from it  give them the opportunity to condemn the slavery and in turn reaffirm their tolerance for u and our different practice  I should point out here that I \u2019 m actually not that different from our guest  be halfScottish and pretty well assimilate  Like most American Jews  I don \u2019 t do much outside of Passover and Hanukah  My Jewishness be much more a matter of cultural heritage than religious belief  I check online and this inviting nonJews be apparently a relatively new tradition  there be some people who believe that nonJews should never participate in a Seder  because it involve sacrificial lamb meat  The rabbinical consensus seem to be that since the Romans destroy the Temple there \u2019 s be no such thing a true sacrificial lamb  and Paschal lamb be just a tasty symbol  The reason I \u2019 m telling you about our tradition of share Passover be to note that we do not challenge the separate identity of our nonJewish friend  We do not ask them to believe in our god or pray to him  We do not ask them to believe the plague and miracle  We don \u2019 t give them a hard time if they fail to use the proper form of address our god  include capitalization  We simply ask our friend to accept the historical aspect of the story  and to reassure u that they do not approve of enslave minority population  We give them the opportunity to reaffirm their acceptance of u a friend and neighbor  deserve of respect and equal treatment  I propose that we a trans people do the same with the annual Transgender Day of Remembrance  This be a day  November 20   when we talk about those of u who have be kill  for be trans and present a woman  and often for be poor at the same time  for not be white  for be immigrant  for love men and have sex with men  We trans people be diverse  but we have a lot in common with each other and with lesbian  gay men and bisexual  Among our family  friend  spouse and lover  there be many people who share goal with u  Those be the people we want to have by our side when we be fight for our goal  celebrate our life  or support each other  Like most trans people I know  there be time when I want to be treat like my target gender  a woman   with the appropriate pronoun and facility  These be the people who be most likely to treat me this way  The problem be that a lot of trans people treat alliance like they \u2019 re black and white  You \u2019 re with u or you \u2019 re against u  You believe in essentialism and determinism  and you support our entire agenda  or you \u2019 re worthless  I understand why people use these ideological test to screen ally  someone who doesn \u2019 t believe that we \u2019 re even provisionally woman  or men  be likely to bargain away some of our right  You don \u2019 t want to depend on people who don \u2019 t really share your goal  The key be that alliance be never permanent  and if you act like they be it \u2019 ll get you into all kind of trouble  An alliance be not absolute trust  it \u2019 s just a recognition of share goal  When you \u2019 re deal with goal that aren \u2019 t share  the alliance be meaningless  As I write before  there be a large number of people who believe that we shouldn \u2019 t be kill for be trans  Not kill u be an idea with broad appeal  A lot of those people will not be on board with free surgery on demand  or birth certificate change  bathroom right or even use our preferred pronoun  But they be on board with not kill trans people  If we don \u2019 t let them show it  that \u2019 s our loss  We should follow Incohate Erica \u2019 s principle of nihil de nobis sine nobis  feminine spectrum trans people who be poor  nonwhite  immigrant and sex worker should be at the center of any Day of Remembrance activity  They  not me  not other blogger and author  and not the leader of mainstream service and advocacy organization  be the one most at risk  and they should be do most of the talk  And their loved one  who also suffer greatly  should share center stage  We trans people who be not most at risk should participate too  out of solidarity and because every once in a while one of u get kill too  Our dependable ally should be there too  But on this day  and on this day most of all  we should reach out beyond our normal alliance and build new alliance around the shared principle of not kill u  This year Queens Pride House will be observe the Day of Remembrance a day late  on November 21  I will attend  and I have make the case to other member of the support group that we should reach out beyond our normal comfort zone to people who be on board with not kill u  but maybe not much else  I hope you will consider do the same  If you \u2019 re not trans  check with your local Day of Remembrance organizer to see if you \u2019 d be welcome  And consider write a blog post or an editorial that will reach people who might not normally think about this issue  make it clear that you don \u2019 t think anyone should be kill u  They need to hear that  ", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
