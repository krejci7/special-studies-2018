reaction to the recent settlement between the MTA about the use of bathroom by transgender people be the coalescence of a new \u201c talk point \u201d about transgender bathroom  the fear that they will allow peeping tom  rapist and child molestors to enter the woman \u2019 s room unhindered  People seem particularly disturb at the idea that the judgment a to which bathroom to use be leave entirely up to the pisser  Here \u2019 s a quote from the New York Daily News article  One rider fear predator might dress a woman and lurk in the woman \u2019 s room  Jerry Fuhrman  \u201c From On High \u201c  If I choose to go to New York  have a few shot and beer  decide to \u201c consider \u201d myself a woman for the night  and camp out in the woman \u2019 s restroom at the RitzCarlton to see what I can see  be I now protect by the law  I know where I \u2019 m go on vacation \u2026 Here \u2019 s a taste of the venom and hysteria in the FreeRepublic discussion thread  but then again  what do you expect from Freepers  Now  will any provision make for safety for \u201c real \u201d woman who don \u2019 t want to be prey upon by rapist and thug dress in drag to gain access to  literally  sit duck  Or do they have to just suck it up in order to appease the freak  Actually  I be pleasantly surprise at the thoughtful and reasonable attempt to clarify the issue by poster Dukat  I wonder how long Dukat will last on FreeRepublic  they have a reputation for purge poster who don \u2019 t toe the party line  The tricky thing about the safety argument be that  like all lie and hysteria  it \u2019 s base on a kernel of truth  The sad fact be that woman be disproportionately victim of violence and be less safe than men anywhere they go  Everyone be more vulnerable when they \u2019 re halfdressed and peeing  shit or groom themselves  Combine these two  and a public bathroom can be a very scary place for a woman  Gossip isn \u2019 t the only reason woman go to the bathroom in group  Given this  it \u2019 s understandable for woman like the anonymous Daily News respondant to feel threaten by the idea of anyone with anything male about them in the woman \u2019 s room  Add to this the fact that there be regular news item about \u201c crazy trannies \u201d who murder  rape and stalk people  and people get the impression that the transpeople in the woman \u2019 s room win \u2019 t act like normal woman  The issue of \u201c security concern \u201d be even throw in to a New York Post column last year on the economic effect of trans bathroom right  oh the poor suffering corporation   by the otherwise intelligent  transfriendly and sophisticated  if shortsighted  Nicole Gelinas  I email Gelinas to discuss the issue with her  and she share these concern with me in more detail  I be move to investigate the issue  I do a Nexis search for peep tom in bathroom and find over two hundred article relate to the issue between 1995 and 2005  Many use innovative surveillance technology  some drill hole in wall or hid in the ceiling crawlspace  some just march right in or sneak in and lay in wait  No crossdressing  Zero  Zilch  Nothing  Two hundred article  Every major newspaper in the country  Ten year  Nothing  I then search for child molestation in bathroom  and  well  there \u2019 s some pretty horrible  sick stuff that go on out there  I could only take fifty article and I have to stop  However  all I find be private bathroom  men molest boy  or men just walk right into woman \u2019 s bathroom and molest girl  In those fifty article  cover ten year  I find one article relate to crossdressing  A crossdresser walk into a woman \u2019 s room and startle a girl  who scream  The police arrive  and the \u201c victim \u201d explain that she didn \u2019 t actually feel threatened  just startle  and when she actually think about it  she didn \u2019 t mind the crossdresser in the woman \u2019 s room  Both the girl and the and police agree it be a simple misunderstanding  and no charge be file  That \u2019 s it  That \u2019 s all I find  Two hundred fortynine article span ten year  cover all kind of nasty crime perpetrate by \u201c normal  \u201d nontransgender people  and the one case involve crossdressing be a misunderstanding  If you don \u2019 t believe me  go down to your library and do your own Nexis search  You could argue that these ten year cover a period where there be no law protect transgender people  and that now that this law be on the book  all the peeping tom and pedophile will take advantage of it  Except that this law have already cover New York City for several year  and nothing like that have happen  The settlement just confirm the MTA \u2019 s understanding of the law  Of course  there have be enough highprofile bathroomrights case in the past that an enterprising voyeur wouldn \u2019 t need to wait for the law in order to claim transgender status  But they haven \u2019 t  My guess be that peep tom and pedophile just don \u2019 t do crossdressing  If they want to go into a woman \u2019 s room  they \u2019 ll just go  I \u2019 ll write another post about how this affect me directly  but for now I \u2019 ll close with an excerpt from a post by Dean Spade  Anyway  what I want to tell you today be about how I be have this conversation on Friday with 2 of my coworker about how I want to create safe nongendered bathroom option here  and of course the safety issue come up  They tell me that the bathroom use to not have lock  but after there be an incident where a male client go into the woman \u2019 s room and expose himself to an employee  the lock be put on the bathroom door  They say they think that the memory of this incident might be an obstacle to my mission  They be tell me a story in which  clearly  the \u201c w \u201d on the bathroom door have not keep anyone safe  just a write \u201c woman \u201d on a key that anyone can take to go into the bathroom win \u2019 t keep a potential perpetrator from access that space  Yet  the story be suppose to illustrate the idea that the gendered classification of toilet somehow protects woman from male sexual violence  ",
