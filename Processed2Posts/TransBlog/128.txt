"tags": ["Articles", "Categorization", "The closet", "Verbal Hygiene"], "text": "Last month I highlight some good research do by Lal Zimman at the University of Colorado  where he find two conception of come out among trans people that be very different from the way the term be use by lesbian and gay men  In the comment  my friend Caprice Bellefleur hit on the next point that I be go to make  that there \u2019 s a fourth way that come out be use  There be a further complication about the use of the term \u201c come out \u201d among trans people  Many  especially those who identify a crossdressers  use it to mean the first time they appear in public in their alternate gender  They may not have disclose anything to anyone  In keep with Zimman \u2019 s use of the letter \u201c d  \u201d with declare a gender transition and disclose a transgender history  I \u2019 ll talk about nontransitioning trans people display nonnormative gender expression  Zimman explicitly exclude crossdressers from his definition of \u201c transgender  \u201d acknowledge it use a a euphemism for \u201c transsexual  \u201d but when I meet him in February I be there to advocate rejecting that sense of the word  base in part on the fact that there \u2019 s so much overlap  Many of his \u201c transgender people  \u201d particularly on the feminine spectrum  identify for year a crossdressers  and in fact the \u201c declaration \u201d he describe be a performative speech act that  in the eye of many trans people  be enough to allow someone to pass from \u201c umbrella trans \u201d  or even \u201c just a crossdresser \u201d or \u201c just a lesbian \u201d  into \u201c really trans \u201d  I honestly don \u2019 t know much about come out for queen and butch lesbian  I do know that for some gay men  come out allow some feminine selfexpression  and similarly allow some masculine expression for lesbian  but I \u2019 ve heard that that be still stigmatize by many people  gay and straight   As I say before  I \u2019 m not really happy with these three us of \u201c come out \u201d To put this in perspective  there be several advantage that the \u201c gay \u201d kind of be out confers on the individual and the community  The dishonesty and selfdenial necessary to be closet tend to be habitforming and have a corrosive effect on character The same habit of dishonesty and selfdenial have a corrosive effect on the tenor of group interaction  Large number of gay men  lesbian and bisexual be out contribute to safety in number  It \u2019 s easy to dehumanize people when you can pretend they \u2019 re not there  but it \u2019 s a lot hard when you know someone  It \u2019 s easy to hate people when they feel ashamed of themselves  but it \u2019 s harder when they have selfrespect  The two form of \u201c come out \u201d that Zimman describe  declare and disclose  fulfill all these characteristic  but they be only available to people who choose to transition and genderqueer or genderfluid people  Someone who have the exact same thought  belief and feeling but decide not to transition or change their primary gender expression have only the display form of come out available to them  When people display they be visible in public a trans people  but in clothing and accessory that they normally don \u2019 t wear  and with makeup that change their appearance  They may not be recognize by people who know them in their primary identity  Most importantly  they don \u2019 t use the same name  How be anyone suppose to know that the Tiffany Sparkle that they meet at the dance club last Friday be the same person a Bob from Accounting  This mean that display have only one of the four advantage of come out  the \u201c safety in number \u201d advantage  and that only when people be actively crossdressing  There may be some feeling of liberation in this  but it be fleeting  and at all other time they still have to hide and to deny their true feeling  And while they hide  others be unaware that people they know be \u201c one of those \u201d and know that all these people be so ashamed of themselves they don \u2019 t want their true name know  I seem to be the exception here  I decide not to transition in 1995  and I decide to come out in 1996  I come out \u201c gay style  \u201d by put up a website and tell my coworker  I didn \u2019 t start wear dress to work  I just tell people  And when a transrelated topic come up  I come out again a necessary  I \u2019 ve reap three of the four benefit of come out  I \u2019 ve felt hugely well be able to talk about this important part of my life  and know that all these people know and be still treat me with respect  I \u2019 ve use it to build bridge in my community and break down wall of hatred and mistrust  But I don \u2019 t get the benefit of strength in number  I don \u2019 t know any other nontransitioning trans people who \u2019 ve come out the way I do  and that \u2019 s a shame  Because there be a lot of closeted trans people out there who don \u2019 t seem to know that it \u2019 s possible to come out this way  The only way they see out of the closet be to disclose a gender transition  That \u2019 s not right  ", "feedtitle": "Page 13 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
