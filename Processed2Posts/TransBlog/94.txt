first on a Q  A by Zinnia Jones  aka Lauren McNamara   Point  The structure of \u201c transgendered \u201d suggests action  a if it be something you be subject to \u2013 that you be a person who have be \u201c transgendered \u201d and that be the reason why you exist in your present state  We wouldn \u2019 t say \u201c gayed \u201d or \u201c lesbianed \u201d  Counterpoint  Other word of similar construction  like \u201c gift \u201d or \u201c lefthanded \u201d  do not imply action  or that you \u2019 re only this way because you be subject to something  Metapoint  \u201c Transgendered \u201d bother some people and use of it will lead to this come up and distract from whatever you be originally talk about  \u201c Transgender \u201d do not pose this issue  Therefore  use of \u201c transgender \u201d be prefer  Ali Edwards expand on it for her transgenderscience Tumblr  All excellent point  To add a linguistic angle  Adjectives with ed ending tend to express emotion and feeling  \u201c I be frightened  \u201d \u201c That be amazing  \u201d etc  Adjectives with ed be also almost always originally verbs  to frighten  to amaze   In fact  that \u2019 s why \u201c gift \u201d have the ed \u2014 it \u2019 s build of the old verb form of to gift  Transgender be not a verb  You can \u2019 t \u201c transgender \u201d something  A lot of transphobes believe you can   \u201c These durn libbruls be gon na transgender my boy if we don \u2019 t stop \u2018 em  \u201d   but you can \u2019 t  Transgender be an adjective  though  and a Lauren point out it describe a \u201c state \u201d Like most adjective that describe quality of a noun  it doesn \u2019 t take a suffix  The sky be not \u201c blue  \u201d it \u2019 s \u201c blue \u201d The glass be not \u201c halffulled  \u201d it \u2019 s \u201c halffull \u201d  My mom isn \u2019 t \u201c femaled  \u201d she \u2019 s \u201c female \u201d And I be not \u201c transgendered  \u201d I be \u201c transgender \u201d For a real linguistic angle  let me a a linguist endorse the explanation of my friend Pauline Park  who be not a linguist   Adding an \u2018 ed \u2019 to a verb to create an adjective be in fact a very common construction in English  and the fact that an adjective be create from a verb doesn \u2019 t mean that it isn \u2019 t an adjective  Similarly with \u2018 transgendered \u2019 When we talk about people  we ordinarily say that they be \u2018 gendered  \u2019 use an adjective create by add \u2018 ed \u2019 to \u2018 gender \u2019 It would be both grammatically incorrect as well a bizarre to say that a child be \u2018 gender  \u2019 while it make perfect sense to say that a child be \u2018 gendered \u2019 Now  I do use \u2018 transgender \u2019 a an adjective to describe certain entity that be abstract  such a \u2018 transgender law  \u2019 \u2018 transgender study  \u2019 and \u2018 transgender community  \u2019 because it be the people \u2014 not the law  the study  or the community \u2014 that be transgendered  So it be not at all inconsistent when I refer to myself a a \u2018 transgendered woman \u2019 and also a a \u2018 transgender activist  \u2019 because in the latter case  it be I who be transgendered  not my activism  Similarly  NYAGRA be a transgender organization  not a \u2018 transgendered \u2019 organization  because an organization itself can not be transgendered  only it member  Trousered  not pant  And yes  this spot in my apartment have good lighting  Expanding on Pauline \u2019 s perspective  and on Jones \u2019 s counterpoint  there be lot of noun that get \u201c verbed \u201d  Calvin and Hobbes  1993  and then have ed add to make them adjective  like \u201c armor  varicolored  halftimbered  leisured  trousered \u201d There \u2019 s no implication of action  You can \u2019 t transgender someone  but neither can you leisure  varicolor or trouser them   You can pant them  but that \u2019 s something else   To Jones \u2019 s metapoint  Yeah  people be ignorant about language  Sometimes it \u2019 s a distraction  and you use the term they want and move on  Sometimes  especially on Tumblr  language be the focus of discussion  and that \u2019 s the time to bring the science  Two point   1  Note that both Jones and Edwards use the passive  \u201c be prefer \u201d  and similar construction in their prescription  to deflect attention away from their role and onto the wish of the amorphous community   2  Note that Edwards  who be not a linguist  cite no linguistic paper for her \u201c linguistic angle \u201d I don \u2019 t either  and neither do Jones  but there \u2019 s a huge contrast between this post and her heavilylinked post on biology and psychology  In fact  it would be nice to get the perspective of an actual trained morphologist on this  Anybody want to go there  Finally  anyone who think that these \u201c ed \u201d adjective be an insult  Well  they sound like very gifted and cultured people  ", "feedtitle":
