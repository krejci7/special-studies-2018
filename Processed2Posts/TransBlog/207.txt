that my crossdressing be a shameful  dangerous practice  and that people would rather that I keep it secret  When I be twentyfour  I decide that I be tire of hiding  and I just want to be able to be who I be  I want to be able to join in the conversation when I hear woman talk about clothes  not turn away  Mostly  I just want to stop feeling ashamed  In the winter of 199596  I be live in New York in an apartment I share with an old friend  In the previous two year  I have come out to two gay male friend  two girlfriend  my father  my apartmentmate  one bisexual friend  and one straight male friend  Everyone have be relatively accept and supportive  so I decide to come out to the rest of the world  I have decide to post to transgender newsgroups under my real name  and I know that it be impossible to hide that  I have start carry a picture of myself crossdressed in my wallet  I know that at some point I would have to come out at work  My work then consist of temping for Vanstar  an outsource company at the office of American Express  We be work for American Express  but we be twice remove from most of the benefit of be actual American Express employee  The American Express employee resent u for take their job  and the Vanstar employee look down on u for be temp  But the money be decent  and it be good experience  One day I saw a flyer for a volunteer fair in the cafeteria and decide to attend  The idea be to encourage American Express employee to volunteer for various community organization  I have be volunteer for a couple of organization already  but I like volunteering  and want to see what be there  I go from table to table gathering brochure  and at one table a guy who work on the same floor recognize me and say to the guy sit next to him  \u201c Angus doesn \u2019 t belong here  he \u2019 s Vanstar \u201d He be probably kid  but I wasn \u2019 t sure  His friend say  \u201c That doesn \u2019 t matter  Everyone can volunteer \u201d I ask what kind of volunteer they do  and he mention a few thing include AIDS education  I look at the table more closely  and I realize that I have be shuffle along with my head down  and I be at the table of the organization for gay and lesbian American Express employee  I felt a slight panic  I have overcome most of my adolescent homophobia  but I be still a bit afraid of people think that I be gay  The guy who didn \u2019 t work on my floor introduce himself a Charlie  say that he be the chair of the group  and give me his card  I mumble something and move on  A few day later  I felt guilty for stop at the table  Would they think I be a closet case  or not really interested in volunteer  It seem important to me to clarify thing  so I pull out Charlie \u2019 s business card and give him a call  I even go to a phone in a hallway away from my desk so that people wouldn \u2019 t overhear  I thank him for his card  and explain that I wasn \u2019 t actually gay  but a transvestite  He only miss one beat and say that I be still welcome to participate in the group  and that they have lunch in the cafeteria every Tuesday  At that point I have find myself eat alone more often than I like  so I decide to join the group \u2019 s lunch  I eat with them fairly regularly  I don \u2019 t remember anyone but those two be at lunch  but they be fun to lunch with  And the guy who work on my floor be always friendly to me after that  Sometime later I be chat with another temp who be leave that day for a permanent job at another company  He mention something about crossdressing  so I decide to come out to him  I tell him  and he say he didn \u2019 t believe me  so I offer to show him a picture  When he saw it  he be impressed  and didn \u2019 t seem upset or angry in the least  I have figure it be relatively safe to come out to him since it be his last day  Little do I know that the temp agency representative would organize a happy hour in his honor that even  And I forget what a big mouth he have  At the happy hour  he call me over and ask me to show my picture to a coworker  A little while later  another coworker  And then one of those coworker ask me to show my picture to a third  By the end of the happy hour  most of the Vanstar people have see that picture  The best part about it be that almost none of them seem to mind it  I find out later that my depart coworker who start it all have be tell people that I be a femaletomale transsexual  but clearly everyone know he be joke  They all say I look good  and that they couldn \u2019 t tell from the picture that I be a man  Many of the woman say that they be jealous of my leg  Only one guy say he be uncomfortable about it  but he make it clear that he respect me and my right to live a I choose  Of course some of them find it amuse  Crossdressing be often a very ridiculous activity  and we crossdresser should be the first to admit it  That doesn \u2019 t mean that it \u2019 s not a serious thing for u  or that we deserve to be mock  It just mean that no one should take themselves too seriously  The important thing be that my coworker weren \u2019 t mean about it  I be still a little worried the next day  but everyone be just a friendly and supportive about it for the rest of my assignment there  which last several more month  I didn \u2019 t consider it appropriate to come to work crossdressed  but I felt free to talk about crossdressing when the topic come up  Every once in a while  usually at a happy hour  someone would ask to see the picture  I chat about nylon with the temp agency rep  The only environment I could imagine be more supportive would be explicitly gayoriented workplace such a advocacy organization  or in gaydominated field like fashion  Since then  unfortunately  I \u2019 ve remain out on the Web  but I haven \u2019 t felt so comfortable be out at work  The next two big corporation I work for  the Capital Group and Chase Manhattan  be not as gayfriendly a American Express  although Chase be the closer of the two   But I think the main factor be that I didn \u2019 t have a bigmouthed friend to tell the entire happy hour crowd about my picture  Later on I begin to think about the difference between be out of the closet and be inyourface  At what point do people have a legitimate right not to know about their coworker \u2019 quirk  If the guy three cubicle down love to have anal sex with his wife  I be the first to say that it \u2019 s respectful  consensual sex and shouldn \u2019 t be condemn or prosecute  But do I need to be inform and show support about his particular practice  I \u2019 d say not  So for a while I keep cool at work about my crossdressing  although I didn \u2019 t take my web page down  I think that the case of crossdressing be different in part because of what \u2019 s at stake  We may think that anal intercourse be icky  but at least in large urban area it \u2019 s wellknown that some people do it  and no one seem to resent heterosexual couple who do  But crossdresser and other transgendered people  especially minority and prostitute  be routinely harass and intimidate  and occasionally beat and kill  Our entire community live in fear and shame  which can not be say for the community  to the extent that it be a community  of heterosexual who practice anal sex  What will ultimately overcome that fear and shame be acceptance  and the best way to gain that acceptance be by be out of the closet  The more people be aware that they know a transvestite who happen to be a pretty nice guy  the less likely they \u2019 ll be to harass  bash or kill transgender people  and the less likely they \u2019 ll be to stand by and watch a a transgender person be attack or kill  The value of that acceptance be so high that it \u2019 s worth make a few people a little uncomfortable  What will change that discomfort into acceptance be if we do it with respect  and in moderation  PS  After write this article  I realize how well this reflect on American Express and the gay community  and particularly Charlie and the GLOBE organization at Amex  Vanstar  which have since go out of business  show it gender politics when a marry male manager be catch have consensual sex with a single female temp late at night in a storage closet at Amex  The manager be transfer to another Vanstar account  the temp be fire despite the effort of the temp agency representative on her behalf  ", "feedtitle": "Page 21 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
