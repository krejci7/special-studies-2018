reporter Pete Donohue \u2019 s insensitive take on the Grand Central bathroom ruling last year  Well  the News be at it again  This time I really believe that they \u2019 re try to do something good  root out the Three Corruptions of waste  fraud and abuse at the MTA  Most of their finding and implied recommendation be spoton  the MTA doesn \u2019 t need a completely separate administrative hierarchy in every subagency  with it own set of lawyer  for instance  And if  a Aaron Donovan admit  the \u201c housing allowance \u201d for executive be not actually for housing but really just a part of their salary  it shouldn \u2019 t be count separately  But one thing strike me a bizarre  BATHROOM ATTENDANTS There be 21 bathroom attendant at Grand Central make  16270 to  53867 a year  Says MetroNorth  \u201c 700000 pas through each day  10000 meal be sell and they all have to pee \u201d This be simply state by the News reporter in a sidebar without any comment  the implication be that it \u2019 s either waste  fraud or abuse  But come on  Grand Central have at least three set of bathroom  although I can \u2019 t remember ever see more than two set open at once   I think the MetroNorth response be more than reasonable  With 700000 people pass through every day  you \u2019 d expect at least  what  35000 to use the bathroom  There be only 21 people to clean up after them  and give that the terminal be open seven day a week  20 hour a day  that \u2019 s really at most two people work at any give time  Most of the time  probably only one person  Is the \u201c waste \u201d in the salary  I really  really don \u2019 t get all these people who have a particular idea about what certain job should pay  In October we have the Subwayblogger argue that people scrap gum off the subway platforms shouldn \u2019 t make more than  38000 a year  Now we \u2019 ve get the Daily News who seem to think that people who wipe shit off the floor don \u2019 t deserve to make \u2013 what  it \u2019 s not clear because they just leave it unsaid  Certainly not  53867  In my book  someone who spend their day clean bathroom  and frequently have to wipe up some bum \u2019 s diarrhea  or some Scarsdale party girl \u2019 s vomit  deserve every penny of that  53867  That \u2019 s about as much a I make when I be a fulltime computer support tech  and a bathroom attendant job be at least a demanding and deserving a the job I have  This be the same kind of thinking that get people blabber about illegal immigrant be require to do \u201c the job Americans win \u2019 t do \u201d As this Slate article succinctly argue  it \u2019 s not that Americans win \u2019 t do those job  it \u2019 s that they win \u2019 t do them for the small amount of money the employer be offer  at the long hour  oppressive condition and humiliate environment they demand  If you pay them decent wage  give them decent hour and safe  pleasant environment where they \u2019 re not be insult all the time  Americans will be happy to mine coal  pick strawberry or mop pee off the floor  But apparently Subwayblogger and the News reporter think that people who mop pee don \u2019 t deserve that  Let \u2019 s say that the MetroNorth exec  scar by this News report  cut the Grand Central budget in half  It would be an absolute disaster  Unsafe stall  broken facility go unreported for hour  mess not get clean up  you name it  But most importantly \u2013 and here \u2019 s why this be in my Trans Blog \u2013 low salary for bathroom attendant  Lower salary mean high turnover  which mean less experienced attendant  Anyone who say this be a \u201c semiskilled \u201d job be talk out their as  One important skill for a bathroom attendant be judge who \u2019 s a threat and who \u2019 s not  and know that trans people belong  If you \u2019 ve get high turnover  that mean that every couple of week you \u2019 ve get a new bathroom attendant who \u2019 s go to blow the whistle on some trans person in the bathroom  Just what we need  I don \u2019 t see any waste  fraud or abuse in this aspect of the MTA  If anything   16270 be low for even a parttime bathroom attendant  Imagine if we quadruple the budget for Grand Central bathroom attendant  That mean that bathroom attendant will actually be able to support a family in a decent apartment  and will probably stay on the job longer and take pride in their work  It mean less overtime and less stress for the attendant  which mean they \u2019 ll do their job well and probably be nicer to the patron  It mean that Grand Central will be able to open more than one set of bathroom at a time  add to convenience and cut down on the line that can sometimes get waaay out of hand  I \u2019 d pay 4  more on my ticket to Irvington for that
