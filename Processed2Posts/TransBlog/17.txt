"Blog news", "Categorization", "Media", "Personal news"], "text": "I \u2019 ve be write this blog since 2006  and for a while it seem that my readership be grow steadily  I join Twitter in 2009  and Tumblr in 2013  and later that year I make a separate Twitter account for personal and political tweet  I saw people retweeting and reblogging my work  But at a certain point the number of retweets  reblogs  mention and comment that my post get abruptly drop  Since then most of the response I get be from regular reader or Facebook friend  This be not entirely a bad thing  I know that a lot of what I write be controversial  and some transitioners even find it offensive  I \u2019 ve have a couple of unpleasant experience  on Reddit and on Facebook  with people share my work with a hostile audience  and it be not necessarily valuable  I don \u2019 t really want to reach people who have close their mind to my idea  whose only response will be unthinking hate  and who will use the opportunity to find way to dismiss my argument  The main reason I write be simply because I have idea  thought  word in me that want to get out  I read thing that other people write  and if I don \u2019 t write down my own thought in response  I tend to get more confused about the issue and forget my early thought  But I also write for others  for trans people who be decide whether to transition  for trans people who have decide not to transition and can hopefully benefit from my experience  and from various kind of ally  I want to continue to reach them  What \u2019 s frustrating be that it could be due to people simply not appreciate my writing anymore  I find myself wonder whether I \u2019 ve gotten so out of touch with other trans people that nobody agree with me at all  Or possibly bad  that what I say be complete gibberish to them  I \u2019 ve occasionally read thing about a Twitter blacklist  a plugin that will load a centrally maintained list of Bad People and filter their tweet out  Now  I believe in block people  there be too many troll out there  But block should always be do on a case by case basis  Group blacklist be a huge abuse of power  It cross my mind that I might have be put on some blacklist  This be a good place to point out that I have not do any of the thing that be normally invoke to justify keep a blacklist  I have never harass or stalk anyone  I have never threaten anyone with discrimination  much less violence  I haven \u2019 t call anyone slur base on race  gender  religion  sexuality or anything else  The bad thing I \u2019 ve say to anybody be probably \u201c fuck you \u201d and \u201c you \u2019 re an asshole \u201d in the midst of heated argument  If that \u2019 s what it take to be on that blacklist I \u2019 d expect half the world to be on there  I get some confirmation for my suspicion last year  when the LaLa Zannell  a staffer at the Antiviolence Project retweeted the claim that \u201c Stonewall be start by trans women \u201d The claim bother me because it be invariably use to foreground transition track trans woman  exclude the trans woman at Stonewall who choose not to transition  The word \u201c trans woman \u201d didn \u2019 t exist then  they all call themselves queen or transvestite  regardless of their transition status  I try to engage with the people repeat that claim on Twitter  and at first I be engage  if with suspicious contempt  But then all of a sudden LaLa Zanell retweeted a tweet from an anonymous account  respond to another  private anonymous account  claim that I have \u201c prior  \u201d so that it be okay to block me  Again  note that I do not attack or threaten anyone or any group  Zannell and friend be challenge a historical account of Stonewall  and offer an alternative  I be do exactly the same thing  That be clear evidence of my name on some blacklist that could be use by people to decide whether to block me  I suspect I be also on an informal blacklist  but I have no evidence until a few month ago I come across a tweet share by a fellow linguist and trans woman who follow me on Twitter  The author of this post  also a trans woman  talk about use these group blacklist in the past and renounce the practice  These list be incredibly incredibly powerful  and for marginalized people like trans woman sometimes the only community they have be here  \u2014 Mask of Dionysus   ZoeyAWolfe  May 4  2016 I saw this tweet from my professional Twitter feed  where I mostly talk about linguistics and try to keep political tweet to a minimum  I log in to my personal account and discover that I be indeed block by the author of that blog post  I tweet this information to her from my professional account  and she happily remove the block  Neither of u remember have any interaction with the other  so it be clear that I be indeed on an automatic blacklist  What be most disturb about these blacklist be that there be no due process  no opportunity for redress  and not even any notification to people who be place on one  Even the people who use these blacklist be never tell anything about me  One day I be visible to them  the next I be go  Even the informal blacklist that Zannell and friend use be a complete mystery to me  The tweet she retweeted come from an anonymous account that block me  The evidence of \u201c prior \u201d it refer to be from another anonymous account whose tweet be private  There be no way for me to see the evidence against me  and no opportunity to respond or refute it  It be perfectly fine for individual to block anyone they don \u2019 t want to interact with  It be also appropriate for Twitter or even organize group to block or ban repeat offender  with due process  transparency and accountability  It be much bad to have hide blacklist maintain by anonymous administrator  with no procedure for recourse or accountability  And it be even bad to have such hidden blacklist apply automatically  with the user be unaware of the people they have block  It be a recipe for disappear people that a totalitarian dictator would be proud of  What I find most disturbing be that LaLa Zanell work for the Antiviolence Project at the time  Zannell may have be junior staff member at the time  but when I alert the organization about this activity there be no response  This lack of interest  and the fact that Zannell have be promote twice since then lead me to wonder whether AVP a an organization would ever adopt a blacklist  Would there come a time when I could be beat up  and try to contact AVP to report it  only to be ignore  I hope not  I \u2019 d like to get some reassurance from them  I write most of this post a few week ago  but I \u2019 ve be avoid finish it until tonight  because it be painful just rereading the nasty tweet from Zannell and her anonymous friend  and even more painful be remind that there be thousand of people out there who win \u2019 t even get a chance to read a little of what I write  so they can decide for themselves whether to read more or not  What move me to finish the post and click \u201c Publish \u201d be the recent controversy over fake news in the US election  I \u2019 ve have a lot of thought about the election and about the fake news  but I haven \u2019 t post anything because I haven \u2019 t have any answer  Tonight another fellow linguist and data scientist post a dataset of \u201c fake news \u201d gather from website flag by Daniel Sieradski \u2019 s \u201c BS Detector \u201d software  which rely on a list of domain that \u201c be somewhat indiscriminately compile from various source around the web \u201d At this point I don \u2019 t think I need to spell out for you why I think Sieradski \u2019 s method be a bad idea  Yes  I understand why group blacklist be tempt  But they don \u2019 t work  and they be open to serious abuse  I \u2019 ve spent my life support independent medium organization  go back to when I use data science to fight Rush Limbaugh \u2019 s misinformation in 1995  I don \u2019 t want to see small medium provider snuff out because \u201c this blacklist be good than nothing \u201d It \u2019 s not  I \u2019 m serious  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
