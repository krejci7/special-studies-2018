from the My Husband Betty Message Boards for helpful feedback  Introduction In linguistics  there be many who frown on the idea of conscious control of language use  individual or collective  such a in the book publish in 1950 call Leave Your Language Alone  People who try to control language be sometimes call prescriptivists  a term that conjure up image of stuffy grammarian write pedantic article about punctuation  However  in her 1995 book Verbal Hygiene  Deborah Cameron argue that there be all kind of reason to advocate or attempt language change  and some be good  eliminate sexist generic statement like \u201c A good doctor talk to his patient \u201d  and some be bad  use natural variation a shibboleth to discriminate against people from stigmatize ethnic group   Cameron \u2019 s point be that the important thing be to be aware of the reason and to subject them to an open decisionmaking process  With that in mind  I have some thing to say about the use of the word transgender  I be not do this to discriminate or belittle people  or out of blind deference to tradition  I \u2019 m also not out to demonize anyone or blame anyone else for these problem  I have specific reason for argue against a current change in usage  and for a specific way of think about the term  I also want people to be aware of the effect of the language that they use  and the consequence of their choice  I \u2019 m go to be draw on the field of lexical semantics  which itself draw on psychology  artificial intelligence  computer science and philosophy  The word transgender and it intended and actual usage It \u2019 s easy to find a definition of transgender on the web or in recent book  The original use be a shortened form of transgenderist  a term coin by Virginia Prince to refer to someone who transition to a new gender without surgery  That one usually isn \u2019 t mention  instead  you \u2019 ll find either the \u201c umbrella \u201d definition where transgender be a collective term include transsexual  crossdresser  drag queen  people who present androgynously and others  Another common definition link transgenderism to gender identity disorder  the psychiatric diagnosis for someone who believe that they \u2019 re a gender different from the one assign to them  In fact  it be now common for transgender to be use a a synonym for transsexual  More specifically  a euphemism for transsexual  Many transsexual have state  both in public and in private  that they have use it because they be uncomfortable with the fact that transsexual contain the word sex  Even though it refer to sexual differentiation and not sexual intercourse  some people be afraid that they will be stigmatize a pervert if they be too closely associate with the word sex  Significantly  there be even recently widespread use of the term transgender surgery or gender reassignment surgery to describe surgical operation that have in the past be call sex change  sexual reassignment surgery or genital reassignment surgery  This change in usage be a problem for me and other parttime crossdresser  but it be very difficult to explain why  The reason be fairly complicate and relate to mental category  prototype effect  peer pressure and the difference between feeling and action  I hope you \u2019 ll stick with me through the explanation  Feelings versus action The first point be that feeling and action be different  There be many different crossgender feeling  Some people feel that they be really a different gender  Some feel that they be bear into the wrong body  Some feel a desire to be a different gender  sometimes or all the time  Some want to pretend to be a different gender  sometimes or all the time  Some want to get away from their assign gender  Some want to wear certain clothes  or to act a certain way  or to have a certain job  or to relate to other people in a certain way  and feel that present a another gender make it easy  Some be content with their gender  all the time or maybe just sometimes  Many of these feeling contradict each other  and many people feel several contradictory feeling  either at the same time  over the course of a day  or throughout their lifetime  Based on one or more of the feeling I list above  or other feeling  people may be motivate to do one or more of the following  act in a way that doesn \u2019 t conform to gender expectation  wear clothes assign to a different gender  sometimes or all the time  visibly or not  groom themselves in way associate with a different gender  present a a different gender  sometimes or all the time  present androgynously  change their name to an androgynous one or one associate with a different gender  take the hormone assign to a different sex  surgically modify their body to resemble a different sex  take legal step to change their name or assign gender  Some may not take any action at all  but simply imagine themselves a a different gender or with a different body  Some may act in sexual way  include sexual fantasy  masturbation while crossdressed  take sexual role traditionally associate with a different gender  imagine themselves a a different gender while have sex  imagine themselves with a different body while have sex  flirt while crossdressed  have sex while crossdressed  or transition to a new gender and have sex in way associate with that new gender  This list of feeling and action be not mean to be exhaustive  I \u2019 m sure there be other crossgender feeling  and plenty of other way of express these feeling as well  There be NOT one way to be transgender The key here be that  to quote Jamison Green  there be NOT one way to be transgender  A person who feel any combination of the feeling describe above may take any of the action describe above  or none of these action  They may have any number of reason for choose the action they do  and there be no way to know without ask them  The action they take do not necessarily provide any clue to their feeling  They may not even be aware of their own reason for their choice  This be not to say that some way of deal with transgenderism aren \u2019 t preferable to others  There be all kind of way to be transgender  bold way and timid way  risky way and safe way  proud way and shameful way  It be reasonable to encourage some way of deal with transgender feeling and discourage others  Whatever some may think  people have a right to live their life a they choose  free from discrimination or harassment  as long a they be not hurt others  Furthermore  at this point there be very little know for sure about the cause and effect of various transgender feeling and action  and any recommendation about the appropriate course of action be just opinion  The role of transgender dogma There be certain way of think about transgenderism that encourage particular action and discourage others  There \u2019 s nothing wrong with that  but the one I \u2019 m thinking of aren \u2019 t up front about it  Often the recommendation and encouragement aren \u2019 t explicitly label a such  but present a fact  More often  and more insidiously  they be not present at all  but simply implied  This have the effect of encourage people to take drastic action without think carefully and explicitly about it  and without be aware of all their option  I \u2019 m talk about a collection of belief that I call transgender dogma  Transgender dogma be the idea that there be some people who  to use maletofemale term a an example  appear male  but be really female inside  They have always believe themselves to be female  and it be their destiny to realize this female selfimage  The only way they can really be happy be to change their body to appear female and transition to a female identity  For femaletomale transpeople  they appear female but have always believe themselves to be male  and it be their destiny to transition to a male identity  The dogma usually also expect that the person will be attract to  and romantically and sexually involve with  the \u201c appropriate \u201d gender  MTF transgendered people with men and FTM transgendered people with woman  Unfortunately  a describe above  the reality be nowhere near a tidy  The \u201c science \u201d that be cite to support this dogma be nowhere near a reliable or conclusive a often claim  Some MTF transpeople do not begin to believe that they be really woman until they be nine  twelve or seventeen year old  Some transpeople have a strong desire to be the other gender without actually believe they be the other gender  Some have an equally strong desire to remain in their assigned gender  Some just want to get away from their assign gender  Some people \u2019 s feeling change from day to day  from month to month  or over their lifetime  The claim for destiny and happiness be also problematic  There be a significant number of transgender regret case  people who have take particular action in accordance with the dogma  and not be satisfy with the result  Some have continue with more and more extreme action and body modification  believe that they \u2019 re just not  again  in the MTF direction  pretty or feminine enough  or live the right lifestyle  Some have detransitioned  change their hormone dosage  or have surgery to reverse the effect of early hormone or surgery  Some have simply make the best of the situation they wind up in  Others have change their mind before they take certain action  Conversely  there be some transgendered people who be able to build a satisfactory life for themselves without follow the recommendation in the dogma  Some have certain body modification but not others  Some be content with transition without body modification  or body modification without transition  Some live androgynous lifestyle  Some present a one gender part of the time  and another gender the rest of the time  Some crossdress at home or in other safe space  Some underdress  wear the underwear assign to one gender with the outer clothes of another  or make subtle cosmetic or clothing choice to satisfy their crossgender desire  Some simply fantasize  There be many people who would like to take certain action but can \u2019 t because of issue relate to job  family or passability issue  However  many of the people I mention in the preceding paragraph be do exactly what they want to do  They \u2019 ve have the opportunity to take the dogmarecommended action and have choose not to  because it \u2019 s not what they want  They have not follow the transgender dogma  but be as satisfy a some of those who do  Problems with dogmatic expectation Looking back at the opening discussion of the use of the word transgender and other description of transgenderism  the people who don \u2019 t follow the transgender dogma be often invisible and ignore  If someone hasn \u2019 t have \u201c the surgery  \u201d it be assume to be because of financial or other difficulty beyond their control  If someone have clearly choose not to follow the dogmatic route  it may be assume that they be not \u201c really \u201d transgendered  There be specific problem cause by these assumption  relate to invisibility  discrimination and pressure  Invisibility Over the past several year  a number of service provider have broaden their service from the gay and lesbian community to include bisexual and transgendered people  Often  the only service offer for transpeople be relate to transition  body modification  or promiscuous sex  There be various campaign for \u201c transgender right \u201d or \u201c transgender equality  \u201d and many focus on transitionrelated and bodymodificationrelated right  without address right that may be important to other transpeople  Organizations like The Straight Spouse Network have include all bisexual and transgender people even though many bisexual and transgender people do not bring up the issue of divorce  infidelity and sexual unavailability that be raise by gay and lesbian spouse  Discrimination When transgendered people take nonapproved action  they can be discriminate against  Because I have decide against transition and body modification  and because I acknowledge the sexual action I take in response to my transgender feeling  I have be tell at more than one transgender group  \u201c You \u2019 re not really transgendered  What be you do here  \u201d Other people have report the same thing  Pressure There be significant pressure on transgender people to follow the approved program  I and other transpeople have often be ask \u201c so when be you go to start take hormone  \u201d or offer the number of a good surgeon  Compliments like \u201c you could totally pass  \u201d or \u201c you \u2019 d look great if you just \u2026 \u201d be a subtle form of pressure  Most disturbingly  several transpeople I know have describe medical and psychological professional recommend particular course of action without even consult their patient about what they want to do  What \u2019 s wrong with a little pressure  The main thing be that no one know for sure what would work for a give transgendered person  Some may be satisfy follow the standard transitionandbodymodification path  but others may not  Allowing a person enough information to contemplate all their option without pressure be likely to minimize the case of regret  and maximize the number of transgendered people who be satisfy with their life  A person who have not make up their mind what to do with their life may be pressure to make irreversible change to their body or their relationship  and possibly regret those change later  A person who have make up their mind be likely to feel annoyed or unwelcome under pressure  The role of gender euphoria What \u2019 s the big deal about a little pressure  People can take care of themselves  right  Not always  I \u2019 m not even talk about complex issue such a a recommendation from an authority figure like a doctor  or a parent make a decision for a young child  It \u2019 s not well know that transpeople aren \u2019 t always mentally competent  Believe me  this isn \u2019 t an insult to transpeople  because it \u2019 s something I \u2019 ve felt many time myself  There \u2019 s a phenomenon sometimes know a gender euphoria that really mess with a transperson \u2019 s ability to make rational decision  When a transgender person take a particular step  such a go out in public crossdressed  he or she feel intense excitement and pleasure that can last for day  This sound like a good thing  but it be often accompany by impulse to do action that the person later regret  It \u2019 s not clear exactly where gender euphoria come from  but we can speculate that it have to do with the feeling of finally get some affirmation for a person \u2019 s sense of gender  transgender status  appearance or sex appeal  It may be an \u201c equal and opposite reaction \u201d to the shame and restriction felt when in the closet  To give a personal example  I once be so excited about go out in public in Manhattan that I go home crossdress to my apartment in the notoriously homophobic and transphobic South Bronx  where I be recognize by three of my neighbor  Fortunately  there be no negative consequence of this action  but I could have be attack if the wrong person have see me  What disturb me more than the action itself be the fact that my decision be so impulsive  and so dismissive of the potential consequence  It really felt  in retrospect  like I be drunk or otherwise under the influence  I \u2019 ve heard similar story  some more extreme  from and about many other transpeople  Some people have leave their spouse and family  some have come out to the wrong people  some have engage in sexual conduct that they later regret  Not all of the rash decision have be protransgender  some people \u201c purge \u201d their crossdressing clothing or supply right after these heady experience  only to regret their purge later  Based on these story and on my own experience of gender euphoria  I \u2019 ve come to the conclusion that I will not make any decision that affect my life longterm within a week after a public crossdressing excursion  and I discourage other transpeople from do anything like that   Transpeople who have go out in public frequently for a significant length of time have probably habituate themselves  so the effect of gender euphoria be small enough for them to make unimpaired decision   The next piece of the puzzle be that many people be expose to pressure at support group meeting  transgenderoriented bar and party and transgender convention  which be time when they may be feel the effect of gender euphoria  To put pressure on someone to make a major life decision when they be under the influence of gender euphoria be dangerous  If the person bring the pressure be aware of gender euphoria  it be irresponsible and manipulative  Pressure through semantic frame Interestingly  many of the semantic frame use in transgender discussion can themselves be a form of pressure  Frame theory be first develop in the 1970s by Charles Fillmore  Marvin Minsky and Roger Schank  and recently popularize in the political field by George Lakoff  Frames be common scenario that people extract from their experience  and can then \u201c activate \u201d or \u201c evoke \u201d by the use of certain word or combination of word  A common example of a semantic frame be the \u201c restaurant frame \u201d that can be evoke by the use of the word \u201c waiter  \u201d or \u201c chef  \u201d or the combination of the word \u201c table  \u201d \u201c dish \u201d and \u201c check \u201d  none of which may be sufficient to evoke the frame by itself   It be possible to make metaphorical or humorous point by juxtapose two frame  a in the classic joke  \u201c A guy walk into a bar and say \u2018 ow   \u201d You can read about Lakoff \u2019 s application of frame theory to politics in this Berkeley press release  The relevance of frame theory to this issue be to explain some very subtle form of pressure  Many frame have expect or recommend action build into them  so just a in Lakoff \u2019 s example when conservatives call vote against Democratic candiates \u201c voter revolt \u201d they be encourage people to do it  when some transgender people refer to transition or body modification a \u201c be true to yourself  \u201d they be make an implicit recommendation for these action  and an implicit condemnation of transgendered people who don \u2019 t choose these action  Pressure  prototype effect and the transgender hierarchy Another phenomenon that create pressure be the transgender hierarchy  where some transgender people be see a good  more accomplished or more deserving of respect or attention  Sometimes the hierarchy be quite explicitly set up  and I \u2019 ve see this do both by transsexual claim high status than crossdresser  and by crossdresser encourage each other to grant transsexual high status  However  crossdresser and transsexual be not the only member of the hierarchy  transvestite prostitute be consider to be higherstatus than panty fetishist  for example  Often the hierarchy be set up very implicitly  and sometimes quite unconsciously  It be frequently do by the use of phrase like \u201c I realize I be more than just a crossdresser \u201d It can even be do by simply invoke a frame  such a mention a transsexual or drag queen \u2019 s \u201c courage  \u201d without acknowledge that transvestite can be courageous a well  The most subtle form of the transgender hierarchy be a prototype effect  an idea develop by Eleanor Rosch and also popularize by Lakoff  where one member of a category come to be see a a good example of that category  It be probably not intentional that transsexual have come to be see a the prototype transgendered people  but this have likely happen because they be the most dramatic example  It be also a way that the transgender hierarchy perpetuate itself  and here we come back to the problem I put forward at the beginning  where transgender be see a a synonym or euphemism for transsexual  This difference in status can act a a form of pressure  It be natural to want to be a member of a higherstatus category and to be see a more courageous  more central and a good example  Many people also want more attention pay to themselves  their peer and their problem  Pressure and coercion In the past I have refer to these subtle kind of pressure a coercion  which be a technical term use in lexical semantics and ultimately borrow from computer science  In this specialized case  type coercion refers to the act of implicitly change a thing from one category to another by use it in a different context  It \u2019 s kind of like shoehorn  In computer science  some language  like Perl  allow a programmer to coerce a text string to a number by simply use it in a number context  The following example Perl code coerce the text string \u201c 2 \u201d into the integer 2  add it to the number 3 to make 5  and then coerce the 5 back into the text string \u201c 5 \u201d and print it  print  2   3  Without coercion  we would have to do each of the conversion explicitly  and the code would be significantly long and more tedious  print  sprintf    0d    int  2    3     My use of the word coercion be intend to convey the idea that by evoke certain frame of transgender dogma  some author implicitly force nonconforming transgenders to choose between conform or be exclude from the category transgender  As discuss above  this be a form of pressure  Unfortunately  the term coercion and coercive language have wellestablished us outside of lexical semantics  where they refer to people persuade each other by use threat  Great linguist that I be  I do not consider this usage  and fail to anticipate that when I use the term coercive language  some people would think I be accuse them of threaten and bully people  Pressure and prescriptivism I search for another term to convey the concept I be try to get at with coercion  and I finally find one  prescriptivism  In conflate feeling and action  transgender dogma prescribe a set of action for everyone who want to bear the label transgender and be entitle to \u201c transgender \u201d right and service  It doesn \u2019 t matter how you feel about yourself  if you haven \u2019 t commit to the program and make progress  or provide a good excuse   then you must not be \u201c really \u201d transgender  just a crossdresser  Coming back to the term prescriptivism bring u back to Deborah Cameron and her concept of verbal hygiene  Verbal hygiene be a more upfront and rational version of prescriptivism  The reason for prescriptivism be usually implicit or even unconscious  and base on unthinking conservatism and prejudice  By contrast  the reason for verbal hygiene can be almost anything  and be usually openly discuss and debate  I don \u2019 t believe that a term like \u201c gender hygiene \u201d be appropriate here  but I do believe in a more open and explicit discussion of the reason for recommend various action in response to transgender feeling  My recommendation So what should people do about the issue of language I \u2019 ve discuss here  I \u2019 ll lay out my desire and recommendation here  I \u2019 ll be explicit about my agenda  I \u2019 m a transvestite who have many of the transgender feeling I describe above  I \u2019 ve make the choice not to pursue transition or body modification  I want to see that choice respect in the community  and I want to have access to the \u201c transgender service \u201d and right appropriate to my feeling and action  I want to have the status of a full  equal member of the transgender community  not marginal status  I want my voice to be hear  and I want to see people who look like me a example of the category transgender  I also have concern about people who come after me  about people who reach the stage in their life that I do  at whatever age they reach them  exploration  shame  fear  anger  loneliness  reach out  come out  more exploration  and various decision about what action to take in response to their feeling  I want people like me  whose desire to be the opposite gender be balance by other desire  to be able to decide freely to spend most of the rest of their life in their assigned gender and not be sham  humiliate  belittle or marginalize for it  Here be some change I want to see towards those end  Separate feeling from action  Keep the definition of transgender one base on feeling  and use other word to describe the action take in response to those feeling  Acknowledge different way of be transgender  Don \u2019 t confine all your example of transgender action to one subgroup  If you do  avoid use the unmodified word transgender and instead use phrase like transition transgender or bodymodifying transgender  Respect different way of be transgender  Don \u2019 t pressure people  Recognize that everyone have their own life to live  What work for one may not work for another  No one have all the answer  far from it  Avoid implicitly prescriptive language  If you \u2019 re advocate a particular action  be up front about it  Don \u2019 t hide behind framing and exclusion  Acknowledge and respect gender euphoria  Be aware of when someone may be under the influence of gender euphoria  and avoid encourage any drastic or dangerous action  Encourage them to take time to think through their choice  In closing  I want to make it clear that this article be not mean a an attack on any person or group of people  transgendered or otherwise  Although some of the most extreme pressure and dogma I \u2019 ve encounter have come from transsexual  I know plenty of transsexual who avoid them  and treat all other transgender people with respect due equal  I also ascribe no malice to any of these prescriptive action  as far a I can tell  they arise from ignorance at best and incompetence or indifference at bad  ", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
