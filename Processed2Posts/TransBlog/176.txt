"text": "I saw her as soon a I get in the door  It have be a few year  but she look pretty much the same a I remember her  maybe a little thinner  I look for sign of what my mother have tell me  but saw nothing  She be the same old Elizabeth  Her mother smile at u  and introduce u to their other dinner guest  Her name isn \u2019 t really Elizabeth  but I have to change it  Even so  people might figure out who I \u2019 m talk about  That \u2019 s what happen when you grow up in a small town  But this be worth tell  I think  and it doesn \u2019 t reflect too badly on her  So she \u2019 s Elizabeth  I \u2019 ve know some girl whose real name be Elizabeth  but this isn \u2019 t about any of them  This be about a girl whose name isn \u2019 t really Elizabeth  I remember how worldly she and her old sister seem when I meet them  They talk about all kind of thing that I didn \u2019 t really know about  like the Oranges  Who know there be town call the Oranges  Their mother and my mother be friend  and we saw them every so often  I remember the summer after fifth grade  when my mom keep repeat  \u201c Elizabeth have her outfit for the first day of class already pick out \u2026 on the last day of class  \u201d At the time I didn \u2019 t expect to see that outfit on that day  I be still expect to go back to my old school and see the same old kid that I have fail to get along with for the past five and a half year  But my mom suggest a change  Maybe I should walk the other way to the other bus stop  and go to the other school with the hippie kid  Maybe I \u2019 d get along good with them than with the country kid  She talk to the principal  and it be arrange  And there I be  on the first day of school  look at Elizabeth in her carefully select outfit  Elizabeth be quite something for an eleven year old  So be a few other girl in the class  Everyone remark on how wild they be  how daring  how \u2026 grow up  My mom didn \u2019 t like it  She think their clothes be too sexual  too provocative  She say they wear thing that would have be too sexual on a seventeenyearold  And she be one to know  by her account she dress provocatively when she be seventeen  I have no memory of Elizabeth \u2019 s outfit that day  By my memory she be one of four girl in the class who attract my attention that year  Sometimes they wear miniskirt  sometimes hot pant  Sometimes hot pant with stripe  or tights with stripe under miniskirt  They be dramatic  they sing song from the musical Grease 2 and call themselves the Pink Ladies  Helga be particularly fond of the song \u201c Reproduction  \u201d and later she be a \u201c Madonna wannabe \u201d Years later I have a class with Penny Eckert and she talk about adolescent social development  and mention the kid who be still play on the monkey bar when the other kid be start to take on gender role and play courtship game  I be one of those kid on the monkey bar  The monkey bar in that schoolyard be pretty good  I be never particularly attract to Elizabeth that year  She wasn \u2019 t unattractive  but I just wasn \u2019 t sexual yet  I don \u2019 t remember feeling real  physical sexual attraction for anyone until at least a year later  Instead I fear her  I be intimidate by her  But I do admire her  and wish that I could be more like her and Helga and their friend  They be brash and confident and sassy  They get lot of attention  and people want to hang out with them  I be brash and confident too  but I be geeky instead of sassy  and people complain about me and avoid me  It be hard to find friend to play with on the monkey bar  These be some of the memory that go through my head ten year later  a I sit in Elizabeth \u2019 s house eat dinner with her family and guest  and talk about how I \u2019 d soon be leave for a year of college in Paris  By then I be definitely sexual  and I think Elizabeth be pretty attractive  So be one of her guest  a Tunisian woman a few year old than u  And then  Elizabeth invite me upstairs to her room to look at some photo  I wasn \u2019 t expect that  Elizabeth have never before show any interest in do anything alone with me  We \u2019 d always be acquaintance  polite to each other  but never really \u2026 interested in each other  Or at least  she \u2019 d never show any interest in me before  I know she could show interest in guy  Some time in eleventh grade I be talk with my friend Brent  and he say  \u201c Do you know Elizabeth  Well she \u2019 s grow up since you be in sixth grade with her  and she \u2019 s gorgeous  I be sit on a bed with her one time  and she roll right on top of me  And I be just eleven at the time  \u201d So there we be  me and Elizabeth  sit on the floor of her bedroom  look at photo  I have no idea what be in the photo  I just remember Elizabeth sit next to me  I didn \u2019 t want to think about anything else  but my mind go back to sixth grade  when Elizabeth and I be in a classroom with a group of other kid  practice for a class play  I don \u2019 t know what it be that I say  I be try to be brash and clever  but I could tell that Elizabeth be get annoy  I keep on say it  because I didn \u2019 t think she have any right to be annoy  because clearly  to my tenyearold brain  what I be say be the height of wit and sophistication  And then  with a cry of exasperation she lean back  gracefully lift one of her lean leg and rub her foot in my face  I can still see in my mind the sole of her ballet slipper come right towards me  Of course there be no physical pain and the dirt be minimal  but the humiliation be total  I remember cry and go to the principal \u2019 s office  I have no idea if Elizabeth be punish and if so  what the punishment be  If she ever apologize  I don \u2019 t think it be sincere  I \u2019 m sure the incident be talk about all over the sixth grade  but I don \u2019 t remember any conversation about it with other kid  I can \u2019 t really say it ruin my status  because I have already pretty much do that on my own  So there I be  sit next to Elizabeth and wonder what to do if she make a move on me like she do with Brent  Here \u2019 s an attractive woman who ten year ago smushed her ballet slipper into my face  Should I kiss her a though that have never happen  Should I use the opportunity for revenge and smush my own foot in her face  Or be I delude myself that she be even attract to me  I never have to make that decision  My sister poke her head in the room and then sit down with u  I don \u2019 t think she have any clue that I be halfhoping to kiss Elizabeth  I think she be bore and want to see if we be do anything more interesting than the folk downstairs  After a while  when she show no sign of leave  we all go downstairs  We talk with the guest for a while  and while we be talk  I notice that Elizabeth kind of lean against me  and then somehow I have my arm around her waist  I don \u2019 t know how it happen  but there we be  arm in arm  And the way she lean against me make me think that she have probably want to kiss me upstairs  That make me wonder what she would have think if she know that within six month after the shoerubbing incident  I sneak into my sister \u2019 s bedroom and put on one of her dress  I look at myself in the mirror and I no longer saw the annoy geeky guy that nobody want to hang out with  I saw a brash  sassy  attractive girl who  I think  would have fit right in with Elizabeth and her friend  And I keep go back  week after week  year after year  I think I be finish with that when I go to college  but shortly before I have dinner with Elizabeth and her parent  I have spend two week housesitting for a woman in town and wear her clothes every night  If Elizabeth know that  would she still have want have my arm around her  Would she still have want to show me her photo  If she know that I dress up  would she have like my style and want to go shopping with me  Could I have be a girl like her  and have the attention of a girl like her  at the same time  As I be think that  Al Sharpton show up  He wasn \u2019 t Al Sharpton  the civil right leader  His name wasn \u2019 t really Al Sharpton  but it might as well have be  He be white  and he have be in our sixth grade class  He and I be friendly for a while  until an unpleasant birthday party that snowball into a really nasty preadolescent feud which leave me with exactly two friend for a time  We have patch thing up year ago  and be cordial to each other  My sister say he still ask about me sometimes  I don \u2019 t think that Al have be invite to this dinner party  but there he be  He seem perturbed that Elizabeth and I be arm in arm  and for a while we wind up both with our arm around Elizabeth  And then it be time to go home  We say our goodbye  and I don \u2019 t think I \u2019 ve see Elizabeth since  On the way home I remember way back to fourth grade  when our class have sit down and watch a film about a terrible degenerative disease  There be animated diagram of nerve lining be eat away  but I think the film be pretty sketchy on the actual symptom of the disease  Then we be ask to participate in a fund drive where we read book  and sign up sponsor to donate money for each book we read  I think my sponsor must have know what they be in for  but I do a lot of reading  and I be still surprise that it all count towards the total  I remember when my mom tell me that Elizabeth have the disease  and still not know what that meant  She seem normal at the party  maybe a little thin  that be all  I know I have a few week until I leave for Paris  and I think about call Elizabeth to see if maybe I could get some time alone with her after all  But then I think about Al Sharpton and the ballet slipper  and I decide against it  Sometimes my mother mention Elizabeth \u2019 s family  and I ask about her  Usually it \u2019 s hard to get much more out of my mom than a sad  \u201c Oh  she \u2019 s not do very well  \u201d or \u201c Ugh  It \u2019 s a horrible disease \u201d The main thing I know that she \u2019 s in a wheelchair  I hope the rest of her life be as good a it can be  ",
