I ask a gay black man about trans selfidentification in black community  and he point me to Roberts  I be  honestly  more convince by the assertion  I don \u2019 t know if it \u2019 s true or not  that RuPaul reject the term \u201c transgender \u201d for himself  Whether or not he count a trans  I think Roberts make a strong case that he be not a prototypical black trans person  or an appropriate community spokesperson  It seem like she wasn \u2019 t content with that  and insist on exclude RuPaul completely from the category of trans  She have now take it upon herself to do the same for another person who be not even claim to speak for trans people  B Scott  I first heard of Scott last night when someone reposted a blog post of his on Tumblr  apparently he \u2019 s an entertainment journalist who do news  commentary and interview on his blog  as well a a YouTube channel and podcast  but have branch out into more established medium  Scott identify a a \u201c proud gay man  \u201d but his public persona be so highglam femme that he be often perceive a a beautiful woman  At least one man felt embarrassed after try to flirt with Scott  and lash out in an immature way  The current controversy start in June when Scott have be invite to appear at the 2013 BET Awards PreShow  He claim that at the last minute  after extensive wardrobe negotiation  people do this   and interview one guest on camera  the BET staffer tell him his outfit \u201c wasn \u2019 t acceptable  \u201d order him to change  and then tell him he be be replace for the rest of the preshow  Scott be now sue the network for \u201c discrimination on the basis of gender identity  gender expression and sexual orientation \u201d In yesterday \u2019 s blog post  he write  Over the year my love muffin and stranger alike have question me about my gender identity  What IS B Scott  As a society we \u2019 ve be condition to believe that a person have to be \u2018 exactly \u2019 this or \u2018 exactly \u2019 that  Biologically  I be male \u2014 a my sex be determine at birth by my reproductive organ  However  my spirit truly lie somewhere in between  It be that same spirit that have allow me to become so comfortable in my skin  choose how I express myself  and contributes to how I live my daytoday life  Transgender be the state of one \u2019 s gender identity  selfidentification a woman  man  neither or both  not match one \u2019 s assign sex  identification by others a male  female or intersex base on physicalgenetic sex    source  It be by that definition that I accept and welcome the \u2018 transgender \u2019 label with open arm  Makes sense  right  Scott selfidentifies a \u201c somewhere in between  \u201d which count a \u201c neither or both  \u201d and doesn \u2019 t match his assigned male sex  But that \u2019 s not enough for Monica Roberts  When B Scott start take hormone  call himself Brittany  or another femme name start with B    declare he s transition  co nt  \u2014 Monica Roberts   TransGriot  August 7  2013 then I ll consider him part of Team Trans  \u2014 Monica Roberts   TransGriot  August 7  2013 Conflating be  trans with be androgynous like B Scott be NOT the same \u2014 Monica Roberts   TransGriot  August 7  2013 Roberts \u2019 reaction be really problematic  What bother me the most be that she be prescribe and delineate appropriate transgender action  It \u2019 s not enough for Scott to appear in heavy makeup  long hair and woman \u2019 s clothes and shoe every time he be in front of a camera  He have to take hormone  declare a transition  and adopt a name that Roberts approves a feminine enough  As I write back in April  there be at least three conflict definition of transgender  Roberts be say that in order for her to consider him trans  Scott have to follow her prescription  Another thing that bother me be that Roberts be not only claim the right to define transgender  but the right to define the umbrella  The \u201c umbrella \u201d definition of transgender be an inclusive one that bring in drag queen and anyone else who \u2019 s remotely gendervariant  As umbrella proponent Jamison Green famously say  \u201c There be NOT one way to be trans \u201d Many prescriptive trans advocate explicitly reject the umbrella  many  like GLAAD  switch between the umbrella and their prescription  but Roberts claim that the umbrella be her prescription  In a subsequent blog post  Roberts clarify that she worry that this identification be purely a legal strategy  and that Scott be only \u201c embrace the transgender umbrella after resist it for years \u201d \u201c Until I get and see more evidence that BScott \u2019 s embrace of the transgender umbrella be genuine  permanent and not just relate to this legal case  call me skeptical \u201d Roberts know a lot more about American black culture \u2019 s attitude towards transness than I do  but I would be surprise if a gay black man who groom himself like a woman and be often perceive a a woman would face very much less discrimination and harassment than a transitioning black trans woman  How often be Scott really able to draw on his male privilege  Based on her reaction to RuPaul  my guess be that Roberts be worry that with his large following  Scott could emerge a a powerful trans leader and spokesperson without transition  eclipse her own influence and those of other transitioned black trans people like Janet Mock and Laverne Cox  Personally  I would welcome an influential nontransitioning trans person of any race to the cause  Any creative response to trans feeling would be a relief from the relentless hormonessurgerynamechange drumbeat put out by Roberts  Mock and other trans spokespeople  And the transition buyin that Roberts value so much doesn \u2019 t stop her from be divisive and exclusionary  But regardless of whether you trust Scott to be true to the trans community  Roberts \u2019 heavyhanded prescriptivism should alarm not just advocate of transgender inclusivity  but also feminist of all stripe  And her claim the right to not just define transgender but to take the transgender umbrella away from u be just uncalled for   Update  In this sympathetic interview  Janet Mock make it clear that she \u2019 s not into that kind of boundary policing   ", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
