people off  but I don \u2019 t want to sit on it  so here it be  Please feel free to suggest change for future draft  Two year There \u2019 s an old and tasteless joke  Q  What \u2019 s the difference between a transvestite and a transsexual  A  Two year  Nowadays we would say \u201c cross dresser \u201d instead of \u201c transvestite \u201d and \u201c trans woman \u201d instead of \u201c transsexual  \u201d although that be problematic because transvestite and cross dresser be trans woman too  Behind this joke lie a common observation  that many people identify at one point in their life a crossdresser  butch lesbian or genderqueer  and then later transition to a binary gender different from the one assign to them at birth  The \u201c two year \u201d part come from the fact that this transition typically happen within two year of the time the observer first meet the trans person  or learns about their trans feeling  belief or action  Helen Boyd  in My Husband Betty  call it \u201c the slippery slope  \u201d and describe the anxiety that she and other people felt about their nontransitioning trans spouse  They didn \u2019 t want their partner to hide in fear  but they also be afraid of lose their partner  or no long find them attractive  Since read about the \u201c slippery slope  \u201d I \u2019 ve watch a good dozen or more people who have insist they be \u201c just cross dresser \u201d slide down to hormone and fulltime name and pronoun change   That include Betty  although she and Helen be able to work out a satisfactory arrangement to continue their marriage   I \u2019 ve read about many more  include celebrity like Lana Wachowski and Caitlyn Jenner  For the rest of this post I \u2019 m go to focus on the \u201c feminine spectrum \u201d of people assign male at birth who feel a desire to be woman  because that \u2019 s what I have the most information about  The dynamic be somewhat different for the masculine spectrum  but I believe a close look would find similar factor at work  A lot of people who have be down the slippery slope say thing like  \u201c I always know deep inside  \u201d or \u201c I have to stop hide my true self  \u201d but previously insist just a heavily that they know deep inside that their true self be male and that they want to live a men for the rest of their life  Others who now claim certainty use to say that they do not know  I don \u2019 t believe in essential gender  so I don \u2019 t buy the claim of essential womanhood make by people at the bottom of the slope or the claim of essential manhood make by those at the top of the slope  But I do believe that people at the bottom of the slope feel more like woman than those at the top  This be not because they have tap into some essence that be already there  but because they have build a feminine identity over the course of that two year or so  often without mean to or without understand the consequence  The consequence be important  because many people at the top of the slope believe that they be essentially different from the transitioners at the bottom  They believe they will never transition  they tell everyone that  and they plan their life around never transition  If they slip down the slope and transition  the consequence for their life and family be often dramatic  Other people at the top of the slope do not know whether they be trans  or whether transition be right for them  They want to find out and  often with the encouragement of other trans people  experiment with different form of feminine presentation  But many of them don \u2019 t realize that experimentation change you  If they slip down the slope  the result of the experiment will tell them to transition  It \u2019 s like put a big thumb on the scale  As the \u201c two year \u201d joke and Helen \u2019 s chapter indicate  a lot of people know that the slippery slope exist  There be three common response  and one be to reject everything trans and repress all transgender desire  This sometimes \u201c succeed \u201d in avoid transition  but repression always make the person miserable and resentful  In fact  repression can backfire  lead to resentment  rebellion and increase dysphoria  Another common response be to accept the slippery slope a inevitable  a Natalie Reed do when she tell me that gender dysphoria \u201c WILL keep come back  And it WILL get harder \u201d If it truly be inevitable  it be important to be honest with our loved one and begin plan the transition as soon a possible  When I hear about the slippery slope I wasn \u2019 t ready to accept transition a inevitable  I decide to see what I could do to avoid it  I \u2019 ve do more than that  though  I \u2019 ve kept my eye and ear open  I \u2019 ve pay attention to my own experience and learn from my mistake  And like a good video game player  I \u2019 ve watch others and learn from their success and failure  On the basis of all these observation  I think I understand how the slippery slope work  and I have come up with a set of strategy that I use to keep myself from slide down  I have be successful  I have avoid both repression and transition  and my peak dysphoria be not much high than it be when I come out twenty year ago  These strategy be highly experimental  I don \u2019 t know anyone else who have try them  so I can \u2019 t promise they will work for anyone else  But I hope some people will find them useful  If you try them  please let me know your success and failure  I want to stress one thing  this be not a prescription for every trans woman  I have no desire to secondguess anyone \u2019 s decision to transition  or to discourage anyone from give transition full consideration  On the contrary  I think all trans people should give transition full and careful consideration  I offer my observation in the hope that other people may find them useful in make their decision  These strategy be not easy  But then  repression be not easy  and transition be not easy  Ultimately  we should decide which of the three possibility to follow base on which one fit best with our vision of our own future  And until we decide  we should experiment and investigate in way that don \u2019 t predetermine our decision  The mechanism behind the slippery slope So how do the slippery slope work  and why do we have such difficulty steer a course between transition and repression  In my observation there be three interact part  feeling  action and identity  They be correlate  at the top of the slope the transgender action be minimal  for example  just wear an article or two of woman \u2019 s clothing   the trans woman doesn \u2019 t really have a welldeveloped feminine identity  and any feeling of gender dysphoria or transgender desire be mild  At the bottom of the slope  right before decide to transition  the trans woman may have already begin irreversible body modification  hormone or surgery   spend a lot of time interact with others a a woman  and regularly feel intense dysphoria when she isn \u2019 t presenting a a woman  Many people interpret this correlation a causation  that the gender expression andor identity development cause the dysphoria  They conclude that this middle way be doom  and the only true option be repression or transition  I myself have believe this at time  but I \u2019 ve come to realize that it \u2019 s not as simple a that  There be causation  but it \u2019 s complex  What happen be that a trans woman \u2019 s feeling  action and identity all work together in a ratchet mechanism  There be a normal ebb and flow to gender dysphoria  It be never constant  but rather rise and fall in response to various factor in the environment  Every trans person have it  and many nontrans people have it  As far a I know it never go away  even if we transition  When we decide not to transition  it \u2019 s usually because the fluctuation be within our tolerance range  and we expect them to remain there  When we decide to transition it \u2019 s usually because the dysphoria have get so extreme that we don \u2019 t think we can handle it  In the ratchet mechanism  each action of gender expression lead to further investment of time  money  effort and even our own body in that gender expression  further development of our feminine identity and a corresponding neglect of our masculine identity  These in turn increase the desire for more frequent and more indepth transgender expression  Eventually our feminine identity approach the scale of our masculine identity in size and complexity  At some point we encounter a crisis  It could be relate to gender dysphoria  but it doesn \u2019 t have to be  During that crisis we realize that we can no longer sustain two strong identity  If the crisis come during a significant gender event  or if we have a significant gender event during the crisis  we also may be experience a peak in gender dysphoria  and our decisionmaking ability may be impair by the intense focus on gender know a the \u201c pink cloud \u201d or \u201c gender fog \u201d These factor can tip the scale in favor of transition  So why do any feminine gender expression at all  As I say above  if we repress our feeling we wind up resent that  and eventually rebel  The single most effective way I have find of head off that repression be be out of the closet  and have people I can trust to talk to about these feeling  But for many of u talk be not enough  and the next most important way be express ourselves a woman  whether alone  in small private group  or in public  Identity development Habits of gender expression can contribute to build a feminine identity separate from our exist masculine identity  Even if we only express ourselves  or interact with others  in way that feel normal to u  or that would not be unusual for a man  if they be unusual for u it mean we be someone slightly different from who we be a a man  Even if we just do the minimum necessary to pass  we be act differently  Often we do more than that  Through deliberate training or practice  or the repetition of simple act of do something feminine or interacting a a woman  we build up feminine identity that be separate from our old masculine one  I \u2019 m sure this sound fake to a lot of people  and it be \u2013 at first  But the line between reality and playacting be not a bright and solid a many believe  People roleplay and practice all kind of thing \u2013 speech  interview  debate \u2013 often not because they want to be fake  but because on some level they want to be real  I use to think of transgender expression a a hobby  like model train or collect stuffed animal  It turn out that it \u2019 s more like sing or painting  because there be people who do it full time  and because we can be tempt by the fantasy of that fulltime life  No matter how big a collection of model train someone have  they generally don \u2019 t think they \u2019 re qualify to start drive freight train for Norfolk Southern  But someone who sing or paint for a hobby may think that someday they \u2019 ll be good enough to quit their job at the bank and become the next Paul C\u00e9zanne or Susan Boyle  A lot of what make people \u201c feel \u201d like men or like woman in conversation be socialization  pattern of interaction that be shape by repeated practice  How do someone get socialize a female  She be perceive a female by those she interact with  A studied performance a a woman may be what it take to get genuine female socialization  You fake it till you make it  Ultimately  authenticity be irrelevant for the dysphoria ratchet  What matter be the size and completeness of the new identity  and how much the person feel invest in it  not how much it resemble anyone else \u2019 s identity  Intention and awareness be also irrelevant  A trans woman can believe she be \u201c just try on clothes  \u201d or \u201c just be myself with friend  \u201d but if she repeatedly act differently when in \u201c female mode \u201d than at other time  she will begin to think differently too  Progress and slip A major factor in the ratchet mechanism be a desire for some kind of progress in our gender expression  Some trans woman have a routine that they repeat over and over again in exactly the same way for year  but many of u like progress  Doing the same thing over and over again can get boring  Like the model train collector who be always buy new piece of equipment  or the singer who be always learn new song  we like to achieve thing  What count a an achievement be entirely personal  and specific to the circumstance at the time  Sometimes it \u2019 s a new purchase  like clothing  shoe  makeup  wig or pad  For those further down the slippery slope it can be a new body modification  It can also be a milestone in the development of a skill  or a social event like a support group  party or date  These significant gender event be the most difficult part of navigate the slippery slope  Without them we can feel like we \u2019 re denying and repress ourselves  which can lead to resentment and rebellion  But each significant gender event contribute to build the feminine identity  It also come with a temporary increase in dysphoria  and often with the shortterm impaired decision make know a the \u201c pink fog \u201d The investment in our feminine identity and the increase dysphoria can in turn increase the desire for more frequent transgender expression  Dysphoria  pink fog and significant gender event In my observation  when a trans woman experience one of these significant gender event  it can bring up a lot of feeling  This can have a major impact on our gender dysphoria  each significant gender event produce strong feeling of anticipation  gratification and disappointment  Each of these feeling by itself can produce peak of dysphoria  and they be accompany by an intense focus on the event that increase the baseline of dysphoria for that period  These event can be so significant that we get excited  Very excited  a in unable to sleep for night beforehand  We can spend a lot of time think about the event  what to wear  where to go  what precautions to take  We can feel frustration with makeup  clothing  pad  wig  We can feel impatient with the lead time  and want to get it over with so that the event can start  These frustration  this impatience  feed gender dysphoria  The event themselves can sometimes be disappointing  The disappointment can come from interaction with other people  who may treat u like men  disrespect u  discriminate against u  harass u or even attack u \u2013 or simply not find u attractive  Or it can come from not like what we see in the mirror or a photograph  or how our clothes fit  These disappointment fee dysphoria  The event can be gratify  we can have our femininity  our status a woman  our attractiveness confirm  We can simply have a good time  But even that gratification can fee dysphoria  because we often want more  If we have success  we want to build on that success  The event can be a high  and then we can experience withdrawal afterwards  Whatever happen before  during and after the significant gender event  we spend a large part of that time focus on the event  think about what will happen  what be happen  what have happen  Just the fact of think so much about gender and about our own gender presentation can increase the chance that we will feel dysphoria  Finally  this intense focus on the event can impair our judgment  This be widely recognize by trans people  and sometimes call the \u201c pink fog \u201d When we be in the pink fog  we often make decision that we would not have make at other time  decision that we sometimes regret later  This state of intense focus can begin up to a week before the significant gender event  and last for up to two week afterwards  This mean that for just one event we can spend as much a three week focus on gender expression  increase our dysphoria  and with potentially impaired judgment  If we have these significant gender event less than three week apart  we may be constantly in this pink fog  Sunk cost The third part of the mechanism be sunk cost  Just an average woman \u2019 s wardrobe and groom supply can cost a lot of money  Even if we don \u2019 t buy a complete wardrobe the expense be in addition to our men \u2019 s wardrobe  If we be in the closet at all  we may pay to rent a separate place to store our clothing and change into it  or to join a club for that purpose  Any specialized makeup  wig or padding be additional  and training be on top of that  These can cost a lot  we tend to think of them a investment and want to get value from them  I spend sixty dollar on a pair of boot last winter  and I be pretty happy once I find a chance to wear them  Time be another sunk cost  We spend time on voice training  time practice wear clothes and shoe and walk in them  Women on average spend more time than men on grooming  trans woman often have to spend even more time on thing like shave and makeup  To save time  we may spend even more money on what Helen call \u201c soft body mod \u201d like shave or electrolysis  We may try to avoid grow big muscle  If we have a full head of hair  we may grow it long  We may forego beard or mustache because we don \u2019 t want to look conspicuous after we shave them off  Further down the slope  some of u get more dramatic body modification  even if we don \u2019 t intend to transition  Some people get facial surgery  others take \u201c a low dose \u201d of hormone to get small breast  All of that money  all of that time  all the opportunity we \u2019 ve pass up be sunk cost  They all whisper to u  \u201c Shouldn \u2019 t we be do more with this  Nobody \u2019 s see my legs yet this summer  Those boot be just sit in the closet  I spend an hour get my makeup and now I \u2019 m go to take a few selfies and wipe it off  \u201d Neglect of the masculine identity Alongside all time  energy  money and focus that we invest in our feminine identity  appearance and activity  we often neglect of our masculine self  We may not have felt excite about living a a man  let alone comfortable with it  for year to begin with  Most of u don \u2019 t have the money to support two people  on top of whatever family commitment we have  or the time and energy to live two separate life  What we spend on our feminine self be money  time and energy we don \u2019 t have for our masculine self  In term of personality  the skill we learn and the habit we develop a woman can be hard to transfer to our life a men  Relationships that we develop a woman may not carry over to our masculine self  The tip point At some point on the slope the trans woman decide that transition be the best course of action for her  Even if she have previously decide to live a a man  she may conclude at this point that it be the wrong decision  She may well be right  but that do not mean she be wrong in her previous decision not to transition  What have happen be that she have change from someone who be probably good off not transition to someone who be probably good off transition  It be the slippery slope  the dysphoria ratchet  that change her over time  Each significant gender event grow and develop the habit  the thought pattern  the relationship that form her feminine identity  As this new identity have be grow  the sunk cost have be mount and she have be neglect to make similar investment in the masculine identity that she have choose to remain with  When the feminine identity be so small and undeveloped compare to the masculine identity  it be easy to reject or defer transition  But if it get to the point where the feminine identity be well develop  transition can seem more feasible  If someone have spend a day or more a a woman  it be easy to imagine spend the rest of her life a a woman  Once a trans woman get to the point where her female identity be welldeveloped  she may still choose not to transition  But sometimes circumstance arise that can make her reconsider  I have know  and known of  several trans woman who choose to transition during a divorce or midlife crisis  or after lose a job  move to a new place  or the death of a loved one  When it feel like everything in our life be change  why not gender too  Here  the \u201c pink fog \u201d play a role again  Some trans woman make a calm  rational decision to transition  but many decide to transition when their judgment be impair by the excitement bring on by a significant gender event  These event can also increase dysphoria  make the case for transition feel strong and more urgent  Keeping your footing on the slippery slope Here  a promise  be a few strategy that I have develop over the year to keep myself relatively stable  I can \u2019 t say they \u2019 ve work completely for me  I \u2019 m far down the slope than I \u2019 d like to be  I can \u2019 t promise they \u2019 ll work for you  but I hope some of you will find them useful  Don \u2019 t repress yourself  You \u2019 ll just resent it  and then wind up rebel  Only take the following step if you agree with the reason behind them  Do not deny yourself feminine expression without a good reason \u2013 like the following reason  Invest in your masculine identity  This be who you choose to be for the rest of your life  You might as well get comfortable  When you think about the future  make sure you spend most of your time think about your future a a man  Don \u2019 t invest too much in your feminine identity  If you \u2019 re serious about not become a woman  don \u2019 t act like you \u2019 re planning to be one  Don \u2019 t spend too much money or time or energy on your life a a woman  because you \u2019 ve already decide that it \u2019 s a dead end  Don \u2019 t get in the habit of do thing that you can only do a a woman  or make friend who only know you a a woman  Spread out your significant gender event  This may well be the most important strategy  In my experience  the excitement of anticipation can last for up to a week before the event  and the gratification phase can last for up to two week after  That \u2019 s three week of pink fog  I try schedule my event at least a month apart  but that leave only one week out of four that I wasn \u2019 t in some kind of fog  I \u2019 ve change it to six week minimum  and that feel much well  If you have experience or observation that be relevant  please let me know  What work for you or your friend  What doesn \u2019 t work  ", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
