people who be assign citizenship in one country at birth  but who later discover that they belong in another country  There be million of transnational people live in the United States alone  There have be many famous transnational people in the past  include Ernest Hemingway and the Chevalier d \u2019 Eon  I be bear in the United States and have American citizenship  but I feel most at home in France  I be at the beginning of a big transition in my life  In a few month I will get my name legally change to reflect the Frenchman inside  but unfortunately New York State do not allow me to change my birth certificate  so people will still be able to see my ScottishAmerican birth identification  However  I \u2019 m currently save up money and some day soon I will buy a house in France and get French citizenship  Then I will be French on the outside  just like I be on the inside  Since I be a little kid  I \u2019 ve always have a fascinaton for France and French thing  My dad tell me that when I be teethe  he put rum on my gum because it be suppose to ease the pain  and I get drunk and start sing Fr\u00e8re Jacques  I love that song  and know the word by heart  When my mom put on her Charles Aznavour record I would get up and dance around the room  Around that time I discover a special French cheese call \u201c La vache qui rit  \u201d and I couldn \u2019 t get enough of it  I ask her to buy me more every time she go to the store  I also eat lot of French fry and read Babar book  I remember when I be four year old  go into the living room and ask her  \u201c Are we in America  \u201d You can imagine how upset I must have be when she say yes  These kind of thing don \u2019 t happen by accident  Studies conduct at the University of Paris have show that French child tend to have at least one parent who be either French or relate to a French person  Children bear to French parent may look just like Americans at birth  but they start show sign of be French very early in life  such a speak the French language and eat French bread  In my case  there be sign of French influence on both side of my family  My mother be Jewish  but when she be bear  my grandparent decide to give her the French name Suzanne instead of the English version Susan  She have a French boyfriend before she meet my father  My father tell me that there be contact with the French go back generation on his side  and one of his ancestor be friend with the Marquis de la Fayette  He and I  as well a my sister  grow up with crooked teeth  and my mother always say it be because we have large Scottish teeth in a small French mouth  Clearly  there be some genetic motivation for my transnationalism  but it may also be due to prenatal exposure to French music  When I be nine year old  a new boy move into my neighborhood  I notice an accent  and be overcome with curiosity about him  I get to know him and discover he be Belgian  I be disappoint  but by that time in my life I be already convince I could never really hope to be French  Maybe be Belgian wasn \u2019 t out of the question  Living in Belgium might be a way to be French without give up my American citizenship  But I be still draw to France  another neighbor be a girl who be part French Canadian  and she have a large collection of Ast\u00e9rix comic book  I read them all  And then  my stepfather give me some wonderful news  we would be take a trip to visit both Belgium and France  When we arrive in Brussels  my mother and stepfather be jetlagged and sleep for most of the day  but I be so excited I go out by myself and spend the day eat waffle and explore the main square and the beautiful gallery  The next day we get on a train for the town of Bruges near the coast  Unfortunately  a our inkeeper tell u  in Bruges they don \u2019 t speak French  only Flemish  I manage to have a good time  but I wasn \u2019 t as excite a I have be in Brussels  A few day later we get to Paris  Paris be big  noisy and full of traffic  and the hotel be shoddy  We saw the major monument  but I felt overwhelmed  We eat lunch at a Parisian caf\u00e9  and I ask the waiter for a large CocaCola  I make a big gesture  hold my arm half a meter apart  to reinforce the \u201c large \u201d size  because I have be serve so many small glass in Europe  The waiter come back with a humongous stein  half a meter high  full of Coke  just to make fun of me  I felt very ashamed to be see by the French a an obnoxious American who drink so much Coke  After we get back from our trip  it be only a few month before I start high school and have to take language class  Of course  I take French  And a little more than halfway through ninth grade I start at a different school  and the French teacher there say that my French be so good  she want me to start in French 2  Even then  I felt that the class be go a little slow for me  so my teacher say that if I do extra exercise she \u2019 d let me move up to the next class  By the end of that year I \u2019 d do half the question on every French 2 and 3 exercise in the book  and I start French 4 in the Fall  I \u2019 d do French 1  2 and 3 in a single year  Looking back  it seem so obvious what the truth be  but nobody seem to see it then  One of the thing that complicate the picture be that I didn \u2019 t care much for French literature  I couldn \u2019 t get excite about Andr\u00e9 Gide  Guy de Maupassant or even Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut  but I like Samuel Beckett and Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco  themselves transnational Frenchmen  Still  I think I couldn \u2019 t be really French unless I appreciate French literature and film  could I  It wasn \u2019 t until late that I meet French people who like comic book and science fiction like me  When I get accept to college  I be happy to hear that there be a floor where everyone speak French  I \u2019 d be able to be around people just like me  But meet some of these people face to face be a bit of a disappointment  Some of them didn \u2019 t speak French very well  some have ridiculous accent  and some be really interested in literature  In retrospect I think many of them be really Americans act out a fantasy of what they think it be like to be French  rather than true transnationals  I think at the time that maybe my interest in French be just a general interest in language  so I take German my first semester and Spanish the second  but I wind up take French again in my sophomore year  I just couldn \u2019 t stay away from it  Then in my sophomore year my friend start talk about spend a year abroad  I be excite at the idea  I have be feel ashamed to be an American anyway  since the country have just invade Iraq for the first time  There be a lot of thing that bother me about the American lifestyle  and I be quite prepared for the possibility that I might want to stay in Europe for the rest of my life  I be still think that Brussels be the place for me  but I couldn \u2019 t find a good study abroad program there  I talk to my friend  and three of them have decide to apply to the same study abroad program in Paris  I look into it  and it definitely seem the best  so I decide to go too  The first month in Paris be very stressful for me  It be hard be in a place where everything be so different  But I be very much driven to succeed there  and to fit in  I make an agreement with some of the other people in the study abroad program that we would try to speak French to each other as much a possible  I move in with three French student  two brother and a sister  and discover that they be transnational a well  their father be from Sardinia  I take class and my fluency improve  After two month I be sit in class and realize that I be understand my professor without think about what he be say  I make French friend and be invite to go to caf\u00e9s and party with them  just like a regular Frenchman  Eventually I learn how to do thing just like the French  I could walk into a bakery and conduct an entire transaction in French  and I don \u2019 t think the baker even know I wasn \u2019 t French  I learn just when to pull up the handle on the metro door so that they would open as soon a possible  I eat couscous and merguez  just like real French people do  It \u2019 s hard to overcome twenty year of socialization  though  and in a lot of way I look and felt very American  Sometimes I wear short  even though I didn \u2019 t go jogging  I find myself shop in the imported good section of supermarket look for peanut butter  I even go to an American specialty store to buy Oreos  There be a lot of pressure on me  and I felt lonely  The idea of find work be daunt  I succumb to the pressure and return to the US  I felt sad  even though there be no good reason why  I have make some friend  but I be plan to stay in contact with them  Many of my friend be Americans from the study abroad program who be go back to the US too  Still  the minute the plane leave the ground I start cry uncontrollably  I know now that I be abandon my true self  but at the time I couldn \u2019 t explain it  I go back to America  and try to live a an American  I finish my BA  and get a master \u2019 s  I become a successful computer technician  I meet a lovely woman who later become my wife  But at time I miss Paris  New York be close enough  but it just didn \u2019 t feel right  I get involve in a group that hold French party every month  where French people who want to be Americans would dance with Americans who want to be French  Those be fun  but there be something unsatisfying about them  It seem like a lot of people at the party be fixate on sex  but for me the desire to be French go deep  I continue to think I be interested in language in general  I take night class in American Sign Language for a year  I know that American Sign Language be a descendant of French Sign Language  but I think I be interested in it for it own sake  I enrol in a PhD program in linguistics  plan to study ASL  but I find myself write paper on French instead  What be more disturbing be that people seem to like my work on French good  I take a job with a French company base in New York  but I be frustrate that they didn \u2019 t give me more work to do on French  I also meet a wonderful American woman and in 2001 we be marry  We go on our honeymoon in France  and have a wonderful time  but I still felt wistful and keep visit my old haunt  I wasn \u2019 t excite about come back to the US either  but I have work to do  The French company I work for succumb to the dotcom crash and lay me off shortly after I get back from France  I continue work on my PhD  and decide to do my dissertation on French  I apply for teach job  and be hire to teach French at a university in the area  Two month ago I go back to Paris to do research  I be only there for two week  but in some way it felt like I \u2019 d never leave  Because I didn \u2019 t have much money I book a room in a dorm for transnational student from America and ate in the student cafeteria  I fell right back into that student lifestyle  and in between visit to the library I walk all over the city  I even pass for French again  I spend several minute talk with an American librarian  and she didn \u2019 t know I be American until I tell her  It felt like I belong there and I keep feel the impulse to explore more  to learn more about the city and the country  I miss my wife and our young son  but I didn \u2019 t want to go back  I want to bring them to France  Even before I leave  I be think about how to get back to France  I \u2019 ve see ad for job that require Americans or native English speaker  When my PhD be finish  I can apply for job teach English in France  But my wife be not enthusiastic about the idea  Even though she be part Acadian  she doesn \u2019 t speak French as well a I do  and have never felt the same draw to it  She think she be marry an American  and doesn \u2019 t want to live in France  She might be willing to spend a summer in France  but doesn \u2019 t want to settle there  I don \u2019 t know what to do  I feel torn  I can try to live with this desire to be French  but I don \u2019 t know for how long  I don \u2019 t want to lose my wife or be separate from my son  but I don \u2019 t want to live in denial either  I \u2019 m take step to ease the situation  Studying French for my dissertation help to calm me  I regularly buy a pain au chocolat from the local French bakery  and go to French restaurant when I can  Still  there be time when I need to be an American  It make my son happy to go to McDonalds  so I go with him  but it feel really fake  and I have to fight the urge to order a Royal cheese instead of a Quarter Pounder  You can \u2019 t go through your life for everyone else  though  and sometimes you just have to be true to yourself and hope that people will see that you \u2019 re really the same inside  I have a friend who seem to have it all go on  He not only speak Spanish  but Catalan as well  His boyfriend of more than fifteen year be from Barcelona  and they be plan to take advantage of the new Spanish law and get marry  They spend part of every summer in Spain  and soon he \u2019 ll have Spanish citizenship  but they still come back here every fall  The other day I ask him  \u201c Don \u2019 t you feel bad come back to the US  \u201d He say  \u201c You get use to it \u201d I feel like tell him  \u201c Face it  Miguel  you \u2019 re transnational  You \u2019 re totally Spanish  Why don \u2019 t you try to move to Spain permanently  \u201d He \u2019 s so lucky  The preceding be a work of fiction  The narrator \u2019 s interpretation of the fact and his plan for his future be entirely
