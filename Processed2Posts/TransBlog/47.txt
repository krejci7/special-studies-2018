Saturday night  there have be several comparison between Rachel Dole\u017eal \u2019 s claiming of a black identity and transgender identity claim  and lot of article condemn any such comparison  Most of those have be faithbased  along the line of \u201c Their god can \u2019 t be the true god  because it say in our holy book that our God be the true one \u201d But I study transgender phenomenon from a skeptical point of view  and I \u2019 ve notice some important commonality  Of course race and gender be not the same thing  but we deal with them in similar enough way that one can be a mirror to the other  You want to dissolve stereotype \u2026by wear a black turtleneck in your artist publicity shot  On Saturday I note the contrast between the absence of African American English feature in Dole\u017eal \u2019 s speech and the numerous African American feature in her appearance  most strikingly of course her hair  I compare it to the many transgender people I know who have spend long hour and serious cash on their visual appearance with no thought give to how they sound  Now  for a nonlinguistic angle  I \u2019 m go to talk about be sexy  Maybe I \u2019 m read the wrong blog  or the right one   but after three day I haven \u2019 t come across anyone talk about how sexy Dole\u017eal be  This be funny  because most woman in the public eye  and most who aren \u2019 t  be subject to constant commentary about their attractiveness \u2013 or lack thereof  Here I be look at her cleavagebaring blouse  her tight pant and tailored jacket  and her curveaccentuating heel  and everyone \u2019 s stick to the script  skin tone and hair  It \u2019 s surreal  When I go look tonight  I do find two insightful comment that articulate what I be also think  An anonymous commenter on the \u201c Toddler \u201d section of the YouBeMom forum  of all place  write  \u201c Rachel Dolezal be an awkward look white woman and be now attractive a a light skin black woman  Say what you will about her lie but her new skin and hair suit her \u201d Writer Calaya Reid have a much long take which be worth read in full  but here \u2019 s the key part  invoke Jessica Care Moore  \u201c Maybe she \u2019 s try to tap into her Black girl juice  Maybe she \u2019 s admit what everyone know and what everyone seem to want you to forget \u2014 that there \u2019 s a power to this thing of be a Black woman  That there \u2019 s some wizardry  some cosmic brilliance to this skin you \u2019 re in  There really be Black girl juice \u201d I should note that I \u2019 ve only see five or six picture of \u201c white \u201d Dole\u017eal  and she be pretty young in most of them  \u201c Awkward \u201d wasn \u2019 t the word that come to mind  but I be definitely think \u201c demure \u201d The publicity photo she use right after she graduate Howard in 2002 be a bit more sophisticated  but really didn \u2019 t do much to counter the impression of be a wellbrought up Christian girl from Montana  I \u2019 m not sure I need to say this  but it be definitely possible to be sexy a a white woman with straight blonde hair  You may have see a few on television  Superficially it seem like it would be easy for her to go with her natural asset  but Dole\u017eal choose to dye and perm her hair to be a sexy black woman with utterly unnatural \u201c natural hair \u201d Why  I get the impression Dole\u017eal be her own hairdresser  so only she know for sure  But here \u2019 s where her action feel familiar to me a a transgender person  and a a transvestite in particular  Because I only feel like I know how to be sexy a a woman  I know what clothe flat my body  and what makeup and hairstyle go with the clothes to make a sexy look  As a guy  I only go with what people tell me  but I never know if I \u2019 m do it right  I constantly feel like I \u2019 m fumbling in the dark  I could be totally offbase with this  but I get the feeling that Dole\u017eal feel like she only know how to be sexy a a black woman  She know not just the hair and the clothes  but the jewelry and the eyebrow  And when she \u2019 s try to make it work a a blonde woman  she never know if she \u2019 s do it right  The irony here be that if I achieve any actual sexiness a a woman  it \u2019 s superficial and it never attract anyone that I actually want to attract  Sometimes it look good in still photo  but I \u2019 ve be tell by people whose opinion I trust that in person it feel false and disconnect from my true self  not necessarily because of gender  Meanwhile  I have on some occasion manage to be sexy a a guy  usually just by be able to relax  to be myself and to own my true sexuality  Of course  nobody can tell you how to act natural  Again  I feel the same way when I watch video of Rachel Dole\u017eal  The moment she move  the moment she open her mouth  the sexy black professor disappears and I see a scared white girl hiding inside  A profoundly unsexy scared white girl  But I hope that for her sake  she have also manage at time to relax  and to be a truly sexy a I have be  It \u2019 s a beautiful feeling  ", "feedtitle": "Page 5 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
