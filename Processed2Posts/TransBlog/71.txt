and Kyle and Lisa over my first beer  the door swung open wide and a man barrel in  with several shopping bag  He be tall and broadshouldered  with collarlength saltandpepper hair and a long shaggy beard  wear what look like they might once have be elegant silk robe  but they be dusty and torn  He wave at Gina and squeeze himself and his shopping bag into the bathroom  \u201c New gal  \u201d I

\u201d Eventually the door open and she come out  She have shave and do a pretty good job with the makeup  but if you ask me the sundress she have on drew too much attention to her big muscular arm  Eddie get up and buy her a beer  and they come back and sit with u  Anna settle wearily on a barstool and smile at me  \u201c Hi  I \u2019 m Anastasia  Ana for short  I \u2019 ve be come here for a year  but I haven \u2019 t see you \u201d She have an elegant European accent of some kind  maybe Spanish or Slavic  \u201c Hi Ana  I \u2019 m Traci  I usually come on Saturdays  but I get the day off today  and I buy this new skirt  \u201d I stand up and give it a twirl  Eddie and Kyle and Lisa clap politely  \u201c Very nice  it balance your shoulder  And your nail polish matches \u201d \u201c I have some time before this place open  and I like the skirt so much I stop in Walgreen \u2019 s and pick up this nail polish \u201d I dig it out of my purse and wave it around  \u201c Plum pomegranate \u201d \u201c Plum pomegranate  \u201d Ana make a face  \u201c So be you transition  \u201d \u201c Me  nope  I just do this on weekend  Blow off steam \u201d \u201c Your wife let you walk around with plum pomegranate nail polish  \u201d \u201c Nah  I \u2019 m go to wipe it off before I go home  She doesn \u2019 t mind a little residue \u201d \u201c Very accommodating \u201d \u201c She \u2019 s the best \u201d I look down at my hand  \u201c This time I get it on smoothly in two coat  Only get a little on this pinky \u201d \u201c Very good \u201d She look me up and down  \u201c So tell me something  Traci  If you be only out for three hour  why put on nail polish at all  \u201d \u201c Good question  Sometimes I don \u2019 t feel like put on nail polish  But it \u2019 s good practice \u201d \u201c Good practice  yes  But if you be not transition  why be you practice how to put on nail polish  \u201d \u201c Hm  Well  it will probably come in handy for SuperFemmeCon in August \u201d \u201c Are you plan to spend the whole time en femme at SuperFemmeCon  \u201d \u201c I hope so  if I can get the lady to give the okay  Why do you ask  \u201d \u201c Because everyone who go to SuperFemmeCon tell me they go  spend the whole time en femme  and at the end of the weekend they feel tremendously let down and wish they could transition  Why go  if you will feel horrible afterwards  \u201d \u201c Why go  I take it you \u2019 ve never go  \u201d \u201c No  \u201d say Ana  sadly  \u201c I \u2019 ve never go  I can not leave the great New York area \u201d \u201c Wow  Old ball and chain really weigh heavily on you \u201d Her eye widen  \u201c What do you say  \u201d \u201c You know  the metaphor  Your wife  she \u2019 s like a ball and chain around your ankle \u201d I pantomime drag around a ball and chain  \u201c Ah  a metaphor \u201d She star bitterly at her wine  \u201c Yeah  Well  SuperFemmeCon be fun  It \u2019 s a welcome change from the same old thing  Who want to get dress up in the same old clothes every Saturday night  same makeup  drink the same beer and have the same conversation with the same people  \u201d \u201c Who  indeed  \u201d \u201c I mean  do the same thing over and over again be really boring  A gal need a sense of progress  Improve the makeup  improve the clothes  take a voice lesson  maybe save up for a little laser \u201d \u201c And yet you say you be not transitioning \u201d \u201c Nope  Not for me  Uhuh \u201d \u201c So why invest time and money into thing that you will use maybe once a week  \u201d \u201c Well\u2026 Maybe if I have laser I would go out more than once a week  Maybe I could swing a Friday every couple of weeks \u201d \u201c Would your wife like that  Would she want to spend that money on laser  \u201d \u201c Well  no  Um\u2026 \u201d Suddenly a voice crackle from Ana \u2019 s purse  \u201c Sisyphus  your time be up  \u201d All of a sudden  her beard start to grow  We all just star  and within thirty second it be the length it have be when she come in  She sigh and stand up  \u201c Well  good night  guys \u201d \u201c Wait  your name be really Sisyphus  \u201d I cry  \u201c Someone name you after that guy\u2026 \u201d She gather her shopping bag  turn her back on me  and walk into the bathroom  After a few minute she emerge in her old robe  with her face pretty clean up consider  wave sadly and go out into the night  I look at Eddie and Kyle and Lisa  \u201c Someone actually name her after the guy who roll the big rock up the hill forever  \u201d Lisa look at me  \u201c Here \u2019 s the deal  Traci  Last year  Olympus pass a package of transgender protection and benefits \u201d \u201c Olympus  You mean Mount Olympus where the Greek god live  not the camera company  I think they \u2019 re out of business anyway\u2026 Never mind \u201d \u201c So one of the first to claim benefit be Sisyphus  After all  he be curse to roll the rock up the hill because he be clever and deceitful  Everyone figure he be fake it \u201d \u201c Fucking transtrender  \u201d mumble Kyle  \u201c Maybe he be hop the hormone would make him too weak to handle the rock  But Hermaphroditus look deep in his soul and found \u201c \u201c that he have the soul of a woman  \u201d I ask  \u201c No  silly  You know there \u2019 s no such thing a the soul of a woman  Souls have no gender  Hermaphroditus find that Sisyphus do not have strong enough dysphoria to qualify for hormones \u201d \u201c Okay \u201d \u201c But Hermaphroditus do find evidence of mild transgender desire  So Sisyphus be give three hour off every Friday \u201d \u201c Just enough time to come in here  shave and have a glass of wine  \u201d say Kyle  \u201c And then start all over again next week  \u201d say Eddie  Lisa shake her head  \u201c Poor curse soul \u201d \u201c Yup \u201d I look down at my nail polish and my freshly shave leg  \u201c Poor curse soul  \u201d ", "feedtitle": "Page 8 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
