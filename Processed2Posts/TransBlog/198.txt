"Articles", "Categorization"], "text": "I be hop not to have to write this post  but recently I \u2019 ve notice a tendency for some transpeople to dismiss story of transgender regret  I \u2019 ve see a couple of blog post that attribute regret concern primarily to \u201c people who think transition be bad  \u201d and criticize regretters who claim they be deceive  I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s any malice intend  but it \u2019 s not a good thing  A lot of transgender politics be base on the idea that MTF transpeople be woman  and FTM transpeople be men  and thus that anything that interfere with transition be thwart their destiny  and amount to a crime against nature  Figuring out which gendervariant people be \u201c really trans \u201d and thus deserving of this categorizational boost be tricky  and the subject of endless flamewars  but what seem to matter most be action and intention  if you live fulltime or have concrete plan to do so in the near future  a lot of transpeople will admit you to the club   As an aside  I have a fairly fluid  Roschian definition of \u201c man \u201d and \u201c woman \u201d that seem to please nobody but me  I believe that everyone be a woman in some way and a man in others  and everyone \u2019 s balance varies  It \u2019 s not even the same for a single person from day to day  I just want to go on record that I be not interested in deny anyone \u2019 s claim to be either a man or a woman  What bother some transpeople be that I \u2019 m also not interested in help them to repudiate their categorization in the other gender   What cause a bit of a problem for the transgender worldview be that there be people who be once consider \u201c really trans  \u201d go all or partway through transition and become dissatisfied and regret transition  There be a range of action in response to this regret  just a there be a wide range of action in response to transgender feeling  If they can manage andor afford it  some will have surgery to undo or reconstruct a many of the body modification they \u2019 ve do  Others will quietly share their feeling with their loved one  Most people seem to be somewhere in the middle  No one know how many case of regret there be  Principle One   but I personally know of at least five  and there have be others document by David Batty of the Guardian  Five people have recently come forward to accuse English gender psychiatrist Russell Reid of encourage them to transition and have body modification that they later regret   For balance  you can read testimonial from some of Dr Reid \u2019 s satisfied patient   It \u2019 s understandable that many transgender activist feel uncomfortable about regret story and try to distance themselves from them  After all  these story be often use by religious \u201c exgay \u201d organization to argue that transpeople should all detransition  hide in the closet and repress and deny their transgender desire  But there be other option beside repression and destiny  I believe that transpeople can not make a truly honest  balance decision about transition without consider regret case and whether these case might apply to them  The fact of the matter be that there \u2019 s a tremendous amount of misinformation out there about transgenderism  from both side  include junk science  opinion masquerade a fact  confusion of passability with essence  and the feelingaction baitandswitch  Mental health professional command a great deal of respect  and most of them take that trust seriously  but I \u2019 ve heard too many story about gender specialist who diagnose someone a a \u201c woman trap in a man \u2019 s body \u201d on the basis of a cursory examination  I think I owe a lot of my stability to the fact that the second transgender story I hear be in fact a regret story  In the town I grow up in  there be a person who go through a difficult time with gender  The basic fact have be confirm  this be someone who be bear male and transition to female when I be in high school in the 1980s  but have be live a male for at least the past ten year  The detail be always sketchy to me  I could swear that I hear that he have detransitioned and retransitioned at least twice  But I be deep in the closet and couldn \u2019 t muster the courage to ask about it  so I have to rely on what I overhear  Regardless of how many time he detransitioned or how many operation he have  the important thing be that he detransitioned at least once of his own volition and be now live in his originally assign gender  I know that fairly early on  and make the decision that I didn \u2019 t want to take any unnecessary risk and wind up with body modification I didn \u2019 t want  I sometimes wonder if transpeople would be so quick to dismiss regret story if they \u2019 d actually meet someone who regret transition or body mod  I recently meet a man who tell me that a few year ago he get carry away in a midlife crisis and take black market hormone for long enough to develop breast  At one point he flip them up with a small flick of his wrist through his baggy sweatshirt and remark with a frown  \u201c I \u2019 m go to have to get rid of these at some point \u201d Sure  he make a stupid mistake  and he be the first to admit it  But I couldn \u2019 t look him in the eye and tell him that he wasn \u2019 t mislead either  or that his predicament wasn \u2019 t a serious one  Anyone who know me know I \u2019 m no fan of repression  but for those who don \u2019 t know me it probably bear repeat  I don \u2019 t believe that transition be always a bad idea  and I think it \u2019 s almost always well to be out of the closet  I \u2019 m not some religious nut tell everyone to deny their nature and pretend to be Ward Cleaver  I \u2019 m just a believer in careful decision  I want my transgender brother and sister to be happy and fulfil  and that mean not anguish and repress or sad and regretful  Because of this  I think every transperson should read at least one regret story  There be plenty in the Guardian article link above  and even on the Recovery Resources website  if that \u2019 s your taste  But one that I think be particularly wellwritten be the story of James \u201c Cora \u201d Birk  Be safe  and take care of yourselves  ", "feedtitle": "Page 20 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
