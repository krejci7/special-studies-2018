an \u201c interiority \u201d \u2013 her word \u2013 that my feeling be evidence of \u201c interior womanhood \u201d I can understand why she think that  because so many trans people do  but I don \u2019 t make any such claim  Personally  I practice skepticism  In general I try to minimize the number of thing in the world I take on faith  I find it comforting  particularly in understand transgender feeling and action  But in talk about trans phenomenon  my skepticism conflict with the way a lot of other people talk about those thing  The key difference be in talk about transgender belief  specifically the concept of gender identity  But you don \u2019 t have to espouse trans beliefs to understand trans feeling or to argue for fairness and respect  The typical story be that \u201c trans woman be woman \u201d and \u201c trans men be men  \u201d support by a number of dubious and hotly contest brain study  On this basis  everyone be assert to have a \u201c gender identity  \u201d an \u201c innate sense of their own gender  \u201d and that be take a the person \u2019 s \u201c authentic  \u201d essential gender  Often this be invoke to argue that it be the person \u2019 s destiny to transition  Genderqueer  genderfluid and other nonbinary people be declare to be a mixture of brain gender on the basis of simple analogy  and the implication be that their only true path be to express gender in the corresponding proportion  The critical thing here be that very few trans or genderqueer people have actually undergo a brain scan  Most of the study that people typically cite be actually perform on the cadaver of trans woman  Of course  trans people typically want to stay alive  many even frame it a transition or die  The official basis for determine gender identity be thus a simple declaration  \u201c I \u2019 m really a woman \u201d You can see why a skeptical approach would have trouble with all of this  If the primary basis for determine gender identity be a belief that we be \u201c really \u201d a different gender from what most people think  and I try not to believe anything without sufficient evidence  how can I as have any gender identity and still maintain my skepticism  But wait  there \u2019 s more  The typical story be that gender identity be innate and unchanging  but anyone who have spend time around nontransitioners  nonbinary people and people near the edge of the \u201c transgender umbrella \u201d like crossdresser  drag queen  and people explore gender  have see thing that give the lie to this idea  I \u2019 ve see all manner of people who one day explain that they \u2019 re \u201c just \u201d men who feel a little feminine  and the next swear up and down that they \u2019 ve always felt like woman  In individual practice  one person \u2019 s determination of another \u2019 s gender identity be even more subjective than that  Typically  a simple claim of belief be not accept without at least a declaration of intent to transition  but some people will overrule that base on their impression of the other \u2019 s masculinity  Often  a person will accept another a trans  and thus a their desired gender  base on a declaration  but then question that gender if they do not demonstrate satisfactory progress in transition  Frequently  a trans or genderqueer person will make no profession of belief  but another person will make claim about that person \u2019 s gender identity base on evidence of transition  passability or impression of femininity  From a skeptical perspective  this evidence be unsatisfactory on three level  First  we \u2019 re expect to accept gender identity on the basis of professed belief  which be inherently untrustworthy  Second  we \u2019 re ask to accept these belief a evidence of an innate  eternal state  even when they have change  Third  we \u2019 re ask to accept belief  report second or thirdhand  that be sometimes invented or assume by the people report them  Sorry  I can \u2019 t do it  I \u2019 m not go to spend year of my life resist a belief in Satan or Pachamama  and then turn around and accept the Authentic Self without question  I don \u2019 t even really believe I have a pancreas  let alone an \u201c interiority \u201d I accept that I probably do have a pancreas because the biologist seem to be right about finger and sinus and stuff  but claim of interior womanhood be a lot less reliable  So I don \u2019 t claim a gender identity for myself or anyone else  The challenge be that I also want to be respectful and to fight for fair treatment for myself and other trans people  I can do that  because I don \u2019 t need to believe people \u2019 s belief to believe and honor their feeling  to treat people fairly and with respect  I just need to believe in their essential humanity  It work for me with Mormons and Buddhists  and it work with people who believe in gender identity  I wish more people would try it  ", "feedtitle": "Page 9 \u2013
