another boy in the class  a boy that I have be sort of friend with for a little while  At a certain point  his eye narrow  and he spat  \u201c You dumb Jew  \u201d I be glad that my mom call his mom that night  and that his mom apologize to u  and get him to apologize to me  It be an inappropriate thing to say  and it need to be deal with promptly  But I wasn \u2019 t hurt  I know that some of the smart people in the world be Jewish  and I know that I be one of the smart kid in the class  I be even mature enough at that point to know that the people who might be call \u201c dumb \u201d still deserve respect  I also know that my other classmate didn \u2019 t care that I be Jewish  They might have resent me because I get well grade than them  because I be a city kid  or because I didn \u2019 t make any effort not to cry  Or they might have quite legitimately resent me because I be a smartaleck knowitall  But even though they be all Catholics and Methodists and Dutch Reform and Jehovah \u2019 s Witnesses  it just wasn \u2019 t a big deal be Jewish  So this boy combine a lie that wouldn \u2019 t have hurt me if it have be true  \u201c dumb \u201d  with a fact that I wasn \u2019 t at all ashamed of  \u201c Jew \u201d   How could this hurt me  I be hurt by the fact that this boy hat me so much he reach for what he think would be the most hurtful thing he could say  I be hurt a few week later when he succeed in convince a mutual friend to reject me  through some combination of lie and bribery  But I wasn \u2019 t hurt by his word  They didn \u2019 t make any sense  That \u2019 s the way I feel about Friday \u2019 s cartoon by Sean Delonas in the New York Post  The cartoon refers to the fact  recently discover by the local political press  that Chirlane McCray use to identify a a lesbian and have sexual relationship with woman  which she publicly proclaim on the cover of Essence magazine in 1979  This be news because McCray have be marry to a man  Public Advocate Bill de Blasio  since 1994  and they have two teenage son  Delonas \u2019 s cartoon show McCray and de Blasio in bed smoking cigarette  the conventional signal that they have just have sex  McCray  with a big smile on her face  be on the telephone tell someone  \u201c I use to be a lesbian  but my husband  Bill de Blasio  win me over \u201d The beard de Blasio be wear a padded bra  panty  stocking  a garter belt and high heel shoe over his hairy male body  and look annoy with the situation  My reaction to Delonas \u2019 s cartoon be the same one that I have to this kid call me a \u201c dumb Jew \u201d in fifth grade  Delonas start with an obvious truth  that McCray once say she be a lesbian and have lesbian relationship  but which nobody should be ashamed of  He then add a speculation that may or may not be true  that de Blasio crossdresses when have sex with his wife  It \u2019 s probably not true  but if it be  it \u2019 s also nothing to be ashamed of  It \u2019 s clear that Delonas be a nasty man who think that crossdressing and be a lesbian be both thing to be ashamed of  This be obvious in the cartoon  in the cartoon that he publish today  and in his previous body of work  It \u2019 s also clear that he see de Blasio a a political enemy and want to hurt him  What \u2019 s not clear be why de Blasio should be hurt by this  It \u2019 s either a lie mixed with an obvious truth  or two truth together  none of which be anything to be ashamed of  De Blasio be clearly hurt by the cartoon  At a rally Saturday  he announce \u201c I \u2019 m offend they denigrate a woman who be a role model by any measure \u201d A number of politician  include potential rival for the Democratic nomination for Mayor next year  be there to defend de Blasio  City Council Speaker Christine Quinn say that the cartoon be \u201c the bad \u201d thing in the coverage of McCray \u2019 s past  Former Comptroller and fail mayoral candidate Bill Thompson  who identify himself a a personal friend of de Blasio and McCray  say  \u201c The first thing you think about be  my God  how could they do this to a family  How could they do this to their child  How could they do this  \u2026 While you win \u2019 t get an apology from the Post  on behalf of good people from New York  I \u2019 m sorry you have be drag into this mud by this newspaper \u201d Delonas clearly mean this a an attack  and I understand the impulse to defend yourself and your friend  But here \u2019 s the key  it \u2019 s only a successful attack if you believe that crossdressing in the bedroom be something to be ashamed of  If there \u2019 s nothing wrong with a guy wear a garter belt in bed  then it \u2019 s not denigrate anyone  it \u2019 s not do anything to a family  and it \u2019 s not drag anyone into the mud  When there be no shame  there be no mud  What be bad  by be outrage  de Blasio and his friend have create the mud  If it be \u201c the bad \u201d thing to accuse someone of crossdressing  what do that say about me and all the other crossdresser in New York City  How many guy be go to feel a tinge of shame the next time they reach for their nylon  I \u2019 ll tell you one thing  I doubt that de Blasio crossdresses  but if he do  the most powerful thing he could do for New York City in his lifetime would be to come out of the closet and then run for Mayor  It wouldn \u2019 t be that much of a stretch  since Rudy Giuliani have already appear onstage in nylon and heel  Even if he lose  he would accomplish more by be strong and run without shame than by anything he could do if he stay in the closet and get elect  I think that Quinn and any other out gay politician in the city would agree with me  Assuming that de Blasio doesn \u2019 t crossdress  it would be a huge gesture to u if he and Bill Thompson could simply make a statement say that crossdressing be nothing to be ashamed of  All I want be seven word  \u201c Not that there \u2019 s anything wrong with that  \u201d ", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
