member of the My Husband Betty message board for helpful feedback   Over many year of contemplate transgenderism  I \u2019 ve come up with a few principle that I \u2019 ve encounter over and over again  Principle One be \u201c No one really know what \u2019 s go on \u201d With so many closeted crossdresser  stealth transsexual  and people from all over the transgender spectrum lie to themselves and to others  and lot of people who \u2019 d rather not hear about u  it \u2019 s very difficult to make any statement with confidence  or to believe any statement from anyone else  Recently  there \u2019 s some good news and some bad news regard Principle One  The good news be that there \u2019 s be an increase in fund for transgender research over the past few year  Much of this funding be in the form of locally base study in the context of research on the transmission of AIDS   I could write a whole article on the problem involve in that idea   Social service organization around the country have get grant to study their local transgender population  and have go out  found transgender people  ask them question  and publish the result  With the sometimesgenerous support of the government and philanthropy  hardworking team of investigator have collect large amount of data  sometimes on only a small salary or even on a volunteer basis  Just do an Internet search for transgender study and you \u2019 ll find a bunch of them  So what \u2019 s the bad news  Unfortunately  a lot of this time  effort and money have be waste due to poor methodology  It really upset me every time I read about one of these study  because I want the same information that the study organizer want  and I know how caring and dedicate they be  I hate the idea that they could have take all that money and leave it in a pile for the client of their walkin clinic and probably do more good  What \u2019 s the problem with the methodology  Basically  it \u2019 s that they use quantitative method \u2013 specifically percentage \u2013 when it \u2019 s not appropriate  To understand why that be  we need to differentiate between two kind of statement  existential and distributional  Existential statement be one that can be paraphrase a \u201c X exists \u201d Some example be  \u201c There be at least 50 selfidentified transgender people in the city of X  \u201d \u201c Some maletofemale transsexual be attract to woman  \u201d and \u201c Barry say he have have a recurrent desire to be a woman since the age of ten \u201d Distributional statement can be paraphrase a \u201c X  of category Y be Z \u201d Some example be \u201c Candidate X receive Y vote for Mayor of Z  out of W vote cast in the 2005 general election  \u201d \u201c X percent of respondent agree with Statement Y  \u201d and \u201c Most of the population of X identify a Y \u201d Existential statement be relatively straightforward  if you observe the existence of something  then you \u2019 re justify in report it  Distributional statement be more problematic  and the problem have to do with population sampling and representativeness  If you \u2019 ve count the whole population  a in an election or a census  then you \u2019 re free and clear  However  most social scientist don \u2019 t have the mean to count an entire population  Instead  they use the principle of sampling  if a distribution exist in a representative sample of the population  then it \u2019 s very likely that the same distribution exists in the population a a whole  The key be the word representative  Random sample be often use  but there be other technique  There be plenty of sample technique that be not random  like post a survey on a World Wide Web discussion group  stand on a street corner with a clipboard  or ask people to refer their friend to you  Nonrepresentative sample bring in the possibility of bias  A famous example mention in Wikipedia be when a Literary Digest poll forecast that Alfred M Landon would defeat Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1936 Presidential election  That poll be bias because the sample be take from list of people who own telephone and automobile  and those people be not representative of the voter overall  The editor of the Literary Digest be not justify in generalize those distributional statement to the electorate a a whole  and thus fail to predict Roosevelt \u2019 s reelection  Unfortunately  almost every transgender study I \u2019 ve see have make distributional statement base on a nonrepresentative sample of their target population  The usual pattern be that a social service organization will survey a many transgender people a they can find  ask them lot of short question  count up their answer and trumpet the result a valid for all transgender people in the area  if not for all transgender people in the country or the world  Since their primary contact be usually with people who be in the process of a gender transition  poor  homeless  unemployed  mentally ill  promiscuous or involve in prostitution  they often wind up claim that a large percentage of transgender people be transition  poor  homeless  unemployed  mentally ill  involve in prostitution  suffer from a sexually transmitted disease  or some combination of the above  Every time I read those kind of statement I wonder if the nontransitioning  middleclass  wellpaid  monogamous  healthy transgender people I have regular contact with be some kind of anomaly  I don \u2019 t think we be  I just think that neither I nor the surveyor be get the whole picture  I feel bad call out a specific study  but examples seem to really help when discuss this issue  In March  the San Francisco Bay Guardian publish the result of a study do with the Transgender Law Center  lead with this figure  What \u2019 s more  59 percent of respondent report an annual salary of less than  15333  Only 4 percent report make more than  61200  which be about the median income in the Bay Area  This run counter to my experience interacting a a out transperson  the only job I \u2019 ve have where I make less than  15333 have be parttime student job  Among my out transgender friend and acquaintance be some very wellpaid computer technician  and I \u2019 ve read plenty of article about highincome transsexual who haven \u2019 t lose their job  This include my experience in New York and Albuquerque  but I know of some transpeople in the Bay Area who make more than  61200  and probably didn \u2019 t participate in the survey   If you read the survey \u2019 s methodology  the sample of 194 be recruit from social service agency and the Internet  with not even a thought of representativeness  I know that the sample that constitute my personal acquaintance be bias  but so be their sample  Which be closer to reality  Either one  At this point we have no way of know  But we want to study the transgender community  We want to do survey  and some people be even offer grant for them  So how do we do it right  so that we get reliable result  Well  it be possible to get a representative sample \u2013 if you have enough time and money  One example of this be a large study fund by the Swedish Public Health Institute  L\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m and Zucker 2005   A total of 5250 randomly select 1874 yearolds from the general population of Sweden  N  6200000  be contact by mail a part of a large interview study of sexual attitude  behavior  and health in Sweden  \u2026 After subject with language problem  severe visual or hearing impairment  longterm illness  or who have emigrate have be exclude  the remain 4781 individual be invite to participate  A total of 59   n  2810  of these subject choose to participate in the survey  \u2026 Comparisons reveal no social  or geographic difference between participant and nonparticipants  In addition  crossvalidation of interview data do not find general social desirability bias or untruthfulness in answer pattern  not even for sensitive sexualityrelated data  Lewin et al  1998   However  since elder individual  particularly female  be underrepresented among responder  we include only subject up to age 60  This yield a final sample of 2450 individual  1279 male and 1171 female   This study have yield very valuable data about the prevalence and correlation of transgenderrelated behavior  even though it only contain one question relate specifically to transgender issue  Of course  that question  \u201c Have you ever dress in clothes pertain to the opposite sex and become sexually arouse by this  \u201d  be itself problematic  and the response to it have to be analyze with that in mind  but the sampling be sound  What if your organization doesn \u2019 t have the budget of the Swedish Public Health Institute  You could piggyback on a similar largescale study of sexuality  preferably one that offer enough confidentiality to reach stealth and closeted transgender people  Another possibility be to commission some kind of telephone poll  perhaps in combination with another study  Official name change record  if use properly  may yield some information about people who undergo gender transition  There \u2019 s no question that it \u2019 s hard to get a representative sample of transgender people  and it may take year before somebody \u2019 s willing to pay the money to do it  or until the world become safe enough for all the anonymous transgender people to come out of the closet and identify themselves  We may just have to forego our desire to make distributional statement for a while  In the meantime  however  there \u2019 s plenty of interest information to be find in the world of existential statement  These method  know broadly a qualitative research  can give you all kind of insight into what people think  feel and do  They just can \u2019 t tell you how many  beyond the number that you actually count  So if you find ten HIVpositive transgender people in your city  you can say that there \u2019 s at least ten HIVpositive people in your city  You can \u2019 t give percentage or anything like that  In some way  drop the quantification requirement can actually be quite free  It let researcher actually get to know the participant a people  with story  and the researcher  connection to the subject be usually an asset  if properly disclose  It leave it to the reader to decide how typical these story be  There be two example of qualitative transgender study that I \u2019 d like to recommend  One  The Man in the Red Velvet Dress  Allen 1996   be by a closeted crossdresser  The other  My Husband Betty  Boyd 2003   be by the wife of a trans person  In both book  there be no attempt to make claim about the prevalence of various behavior or feeling  the focus be on individual and their story   I like My Husband Betty so much that I join the message board that Betty set up on the book \u2019 s website  and get to know Helen and Betty and some of the other people whose story be tell in the book   If you want short example before go out and buy a book  much of the work of Raven Kaldera  a femaletomale transsexual  be qualitative  Quantitative research can be very valuable even when it be possible to get a representative sample of a population  One of it most important us be to get a basic understanding of the issue involve in order to properly formulate question for quantitative study  If you don \u2019 t know that there be woman who get sexually arouse by wear men \u2019 s clothes  how do you know to ask them about it when you \u2019 re do that grand survey  Agar  1996  have suggest that instead of two contradictory  or even complementary  approach  qualitative and quantitative method exist on a continuum  from the very formal  very broad  multiplechoice survey conduct by a distant  disinterested researcher to the informal  indepth  freeform discussion conduct by an ethnographer who become a member of the community  if he or she wasn \u2019 t one before the study  The qualitative  ethnographic investigation make it possible to have successful quantitative investigation later on  Maybe you \u2019 re think that nobody \u2019 s go to want to read a bunch of story instead of some snappy statistic  And nobody \u2019 s go to pay for you to go and hang out at Ina \u2019 s take note  But it \u2019 s not necessarily true  There \u2019 s no denying that percentage have a certain prestige  or that certain people involve in public health funding like to see quantitative work  That doesn \u2019 t mean there \u2019 s no funding  though  There \u2019 s a large number of social scientist who support qualitative research and be willing to recommend funding it  My Husband Betty be currently in it fifth printing  and Helen \u2019 s presentation at transgender conference be quite popular  So please  keep study the transgender community  And if you \u2019 ve get the money or the influence  please do a representative sample of the transgender population  it would be incredibly useful  But if you can \u2019 t  rather than waste time and money on more useless statistic  I hope that you \u2019 ll throw away your questionnaire and go do some indepth interview of interesting transgender people  Or just observe  If you \u2019 re wonder how to do this kind of thing  read the writing of Helen Boyd  JJ Allen and Raven Kaldera  More generally  the linguist Melissa Axelrod have recommend the book by Agar  1996   Jackson and Ives  1996   and Rubin and Rubin  2004   and I find all three to be extremely helpful  There be sample chapter on the website for Rubin and Rubin  2004   My Husband Betty message board member Switchme have also recommend the book Quick Ethnography  2001  by W Penn Handwerker  Judging by Handwerker \u2019 s \u201c Sampling Design \u201d article  2005   he seem to follow the principle I \u2019 ve use in this article  Switchme also recommend Analyzing Social Settings  by Lofland et al   2005   Good luck  and if you do some good research  drop me a line  References Agar  Michael  1996  The Professional Stranger  An
