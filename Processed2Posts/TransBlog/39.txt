In Slate  Michelle Goldberg write about a group of \u201c gendercritical trans woman  \u201d include several who identify a transgender or transsexual  In a reaction to the shutdown of the CAMH clinic  Alice Dreger talk about people who be gender nonconforming child and didn \u2019 t transition  link to a book call Blood and Visions  a post by Debra Soh and an interview with Sarah Hoffman  Maria Catt write about her experience take and dispense testosterone to femalebodied people  Joel Nowak hoist a great comment by Juniper ask  \u201c Where be the example of  so many  people who have live long and well WITHOUT surgery or hormone  \u201d 4th Wave Now expand on Juniper \u2019 s post  highlight the value of alternative to transition in reduce the incidence of trans suicide  We do need to hear more from example of people who have successfully cop with gender dsyphoria without transition  So  let \u2019 s take a look at who \u2019 s represent in these article  Women who don \u2019 t suffer from chronic gender dysphoria  Goldberg  Dreger  Hoffman and 4th Wave Now  Women who have deal with dysphoria without transition  Soh and Juniper  People raise a girl who transition to live a men  then detransitioned  Catt and the author of Blood and Visions  People raise a boy who transition to live a woman  but be critical of transgender dogma and identify a male  the woman interview by Goldberg  People raise a boy who transition to live a woman  then detransitioned  Joel and the author of Third Way Trans  These be all important story  important voice  But there \u2019 s a population miss  men who have deal with dysphoria without transition  If people like Joel and Juniper be virtually invisible  people like me be actually invisible  And yet our story be hugely important  Most of the people I \u2019 ve mention have complain about transgender dogma  particularly a articulate by transitioned trans woman  and particularly about the demand make by transitioned trans woman for unconditional access to woman \u2019 s space  Many have complain about the behavior of individual transition trans woman  online and in person  It \u2019 s very nice for transitioned trans woman to be accept  by some  a feminist  It \u2019 s absolutely essential for detransitioned trans woman to be hear  But if what we \u2019 re look for be alternative to transition  we need to make space for people raise male to talk about how we deal with gender dysphoria without transition  And people need to listen to u  not just talk at u  I \u2019 ve be blogging about this stuff for year  and for some reason I \u2019 m not mention by Goldberg or Dreger or Catt or Joel  I have some conversation with detransitioned trans men on Tumblr a few year ago  and they get very angry  I try talk to the gendercritical trans woman on Tumblr  and they ignore me  I try to talk to Joel about this on Twitter  but he cut me off  I simply post about my genderrelated feeling on my own blog  and gendercritical feminist mock me on their blog  I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s me  but let \u2019 s assume that it be  Let \u2019 s assume that I somehow come off a a huge asshole  Why be I the only one blogging about this stuff  Why haven \u2019 t Goldberg or Dreger  who be journalist  go and find some malebodied people who have deal with gender dysphoria without transition  I have a simple theory about this  It \u2019 s one thing to deal with woman  even gender nonconforming woman and detransitioned trans men  Boys be pretty safe  especially \u201c pink boys \u201d If you \u2019 re willing to be flexible  transition and even detransitioned trans woman can be see a womanly enough  They \u2019 ve have hair removal and lot of female socialization  But it \u2019 s another thing to deal with men  Big strong hairy muscular men with deep voice  talk about sport or gadget or hunting  some of u in dress  Third Wave Trans have write one of the wise thing I \u2019 ve read about this  many people  include me  have be traumatize by men in their life  I \u2019 ve largely get over my trauma  but lot of people have a hard time trust men  Some have a hard time even be in the same room with men  I get this  I \u2019 m not ask anyone to go beyond their comfort zone  If some people be unable to relate to men without be mistrustful or hostile \u2013 or at all \u2013 I \u2019 m not go to demand that they do  But someone need to talk to u  Someone need to listen to u  Someone need to help u to be out and proud  Someone need to tell the young trans woman out there that they can be happy without transition  Joel accuse me of demand \u201c politeness \u201d I be not  I be also not try to impose patriarchy or mansplain or dominate any discussion  To paraphrase the immortal word of stimmyabby  I \u2019 m not demand anyone treat me a an authority  only a a person  I think it \u2019 s reasonable to ask people not to use u a insult to mock transitioned trans woman  If you \u2019 re go to make pronouncement about what we should and shouldn \u2019 t do  you could at least ask u if we think that would work  I be not write this to criticize people for what they \u2019 ve write in the past  only voice a plea for what they will write in the future  The bottom line be that if we don \u2019 t want all the trans woman think they have to transition  or commit suicide  we have to make it safe for trans woman to be men  ", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
