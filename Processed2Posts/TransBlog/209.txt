"tags": ["Articles", "Categorization", "Gender fog", "The closet", "Verbal Hygiene"], "text": "As I have time  I \u2019 m go to gradually migrate my writing from my old transvestite website to this new blog  revise and update them in the process  I \u2019 ll also write new article a the muse strike me  Many of them will relate to this list of principle that I develop in 2005 and have be expand since  For the past two and a half year I \u2019 ve be participate on the  en  gender Message Boards  moderate by Helen Boyd  author of My Husband Betty  and her husband Betty Crow  It \u2019 s a really good group of people  with lot of interest idea about transgender phenomenon  but over that time I \u2019 ve find myself say a few thing over and over again  This page be write in part to save myself some type on this message board  the next time one of these come up I can just link to Principle 3  Kind of like the joke about the comedian \u2019 club  Right now I \u2019 ll just write a little blurb for each principle  As time go on I may expand them into fullfledged article  1  No one really know what \u2019 s go on Discussions about transgenderism be often full of generalization  \u201c Transgender individual be like this  \u201d or \u201c Transsexuals be like this  but crossdresser be like that \u201d The fact of the matter be that nobody \u2019 s do enough research to prove this  so everyone \u2019 s go on hunch  Unfortunately  hunch can often be wrong  The bottom line be that nobody have information beyond the people that they \u2019 ve talk to  Except in Sweden  2  Sometimes it be sexual Lots of TG people bend over backwards to say \u201c Hey  we \u2019 re not pervert  It \u2019 s not sexual for u  We \u2019 re really woman inside  \u201d or \u201c We \u2019 re express our feminine side  \u201d And maybe it \u2019 s true for them  But it \u2019 s not true for everyone  For me  personally  it \u2019 s sexual  That \u2019 s not to say that it \u2019 s exclusively sexual  or that crossdressing be the equivalent of have sex  It \u2019 s just say that it \u2019 s sexual  3  Beware of gender euphoria Crossdressing can be excite in many way  but there \u2019 s a certain kind of excitement that come from crossdressing in public  Something about have normal interaction with other people while present a the target gender can really make a transgendered person feel good  The problem be that sometimes it can feel too good  so good that you want more  TG people can get really carry away like this  and wind up do thing that they regret  like irreversable body modification  or wreck their relationship  4  There be degree of transvestite sexuality This be kind of a followup to Principle 2  Right after I admit to myself that my crossdressing be sexual  I felt bad about go out in public crossdressed  Then I realize that people be sexual in public all the time  and it \u2019 s not consider a bad thing  at least in certain part of the country  People flirt  hold hand  kiss and cuddle in public  When I go out crossdressed in public  the sexual aspect never get more intense than that  5  There be no one way to be transgendered I have Jamison Green to thank for this one  It \u2019 s also be paraphrase by Helen Boyd a \u201c There \u2019 s no right way to be trans  There \u2019 s no wrong way to be trans \u201d This be obviously relate to Principle 1  but slightly different  Unfortunately  it \u2019 s all too common in the transgender community to hear statement invalidate one person \u2019 s transgender experience and suggest that \u201c real \u201d transgenders do suchandsuch  To quote another transgender thinker  Flawless Sabrina  \u201c We \u2019 re like snowflakes \u201d 6  Going out be not the same a be out Recently there \u2019 s be a movement of crossdresser to go out in public  usually shop or to bar  and say that they \u2019 re \u201c out of the closet \u201d While it do involve reveal transgender status to at least some people  this concept of \u201c out \u201d be very different from the one use in the gay and lesbian community  where it be borrow from  A gay man who hold hand with his lover while walk through Chelsea  but then tell his family  coworker and neighbor that they \u2019 re \u201c just friends \u201d would not be consider out of the closet  and I don \u2019 t consider a crossdresser who be only see crossdressed anonymously or in transsafe space to be out of the closet  The value of be out be to bring awareness of our humanity to those outside of our community  to show them that crossdresser aren \u2019 t just freak on Maury Povich  but friend  brother  neighbor and coworker  Being see a a random crossdressed stranger on the street  in a store  or in a bar do very little for that kind of awareness  If you \u2019 re not up to it  that \u2019 s fine  just don \u2019 t call yourself \u201c out  \u201d or you \u2019 ll piss me off  7  Don \u2019 t judge the normal by the standard of the exceptional Just about anyone who \u2019 s have contact with the trans community have have the experience of meet someone who \u2019 s a \u201c great pass \u201d Often there \u2019 s the idea that this person must \u201c really \u201d be a woman because she seem so feminine  And maybe it \u2019 s true for some people  But often what they \u2019 re perceiving be really physical characteristic  body size or shape  facial feature  high voice   or skill  good actor  good mimic  good dancer  good with makeup   And I think people wind up judge normal transpeople by the standard of these exceptional people  and believe that these normal people aren \u2019 t \u201c really trans \u201d because they don \u2019 t pas as well  8  Experimentation change you I \u2019 ve often want to explore female role  by interact with supportive friend and my wife  and by go out in public  while present a a woman  I figure it be a good way for me to figure out how far I want to go with thing  and what kind of thing I want or didn \u2019 t want to do  The problem be that the act of exploration and experimentation change you  Going out in public  go on date  take voice lesson  put together a presentable wardrobe in addition to my fantasy one \u2013 all of those thing change who I be and how I relate to myself  to gender and to other people  Some thing I haven \u2019 t be able to go back on  some thing have set me off in unexpected direction  Some of it work through gender euphoria  some of it through other mechanism that I don \u2019 t understand  It hasn \u2019 t all be bad  but it hasn \u2019 t necessarily be good  So if you want to experiment  try to anticipate the consequence of experiment  ", "feedtitle": "Page 21 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
