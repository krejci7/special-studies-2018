long time reader and commenter of this blog  She write  \u201c Dealing with feeling of love and commitment to each other yet try to cope with the envy and enticement of transition  But not want to give up our life which we have invest in  How do you cope with envy  Thoughts  \u201d That be such a good question  Vee  that I felt it deserve it own post  I definitely feel that kind of envy when I see pretty young transitioners all dress up  date and have fun  while I get old with big shoulder  thicker facial hair and a big belly  As you acknowledge  the first principle of trans stuff be that Nobody Knows What \u2019 s Going On  I can \u2019 t tell you what will work for your husband  But with that in mind  here be some thing that have help with me  When I feel this envy  it \u2019 s not just gardenvariety envy  If I see someone with a fancy new phone  I \u2019 ll feel motivate to save up to buy that phone  If I see someone casually pick up heavy thing the way I use to do before I hurt my back  I \u2019 ll feel wistful  Neither of those be really anything like what I feel when I see a fullylasered trans woman with long flow hair giggle with celebrity on television  What I feel at that point be the glamour longing  a describe by Virginia Postrel  By bind image and desire  glamour give u pleasure  even a it heighten our yearning  It make u feel that the life we dream of exists  and to desire it even more  We recognize glamour by it emotional effect\u2014a sense of projection and longing\u2014and by the element from which that effect arises  mystery  grace  and the promise of escape and transformation  The glamour longing be at it heart a symptom of the desire to escape \u2013 to escape from something in our life which be almost unbearable  It be trigger by these other trans people  who seem to have escape  But just a a red car be rarely an escape from a deadend job  a mistress with blond hair be rarely an escape from a loveless marriage  and a big house be rarely an escape from feeling of inadequacy instill by prejudice  transition be very rarely an actual escape from whatever it be that trap u  One thing that have help me a bit be to actually live that fantasy for brief period  I \u2019 ve walk through the street of Manhattan and have people  men and woman  say admire thing a I go past  It get me high for a while  but even at the time I be aware of how uncomfortable it be wear falsie  Spanx  high heel and a ton of makeup  Most woman don \u2019 t get dress up like that every day  After I come down  and boy be it important to come down after that  and it take almost two week  Remember to spread out your significant gender event   I realize that present a a woman in public hadn \u2019 t really change anything in my life  I be still marry to the same woman  with the same kid  the same apartment and the same job  I \u2019 m generally happy in my marriage  but even if I have be look for someone else  none of the people who show interest in me be very promising a longterm partner  In a lot of way  the whole exercise felt like a waste of time  Another thing that help be to get to know the people you \u2019 re feel envious of  or to read what they write about their daytoday life  These cute  young trans woman be people too  Some of them be do okay  some be frustrate  some be downright miserable  None of them seem to be have all that much good a time than I be  Transition didn \u2019 t magically solve any of their problem  But you don \u2019 t have to go out in public  or even meet anyone else  to deal with this envy  Here \u2019 s a key piece that I \u2019 ve observe in my own glamour longing  it get strong when thing be go badly in my life  and it \u2019 s weak when thing be go well  This have be particularly true with my romantic life  my interest in be a woman disappear for several month after the first time I kiss a girl  and the same thing happen after I move in with my wife  I \u2019 ve heard similar story from many other trans people  and it make sense if the envy be really a longing to escape  So here \u2019 s my top recommendation for your husband  Vee  and anyone else who \u2019 s feeling this way  Try to change thing that make you feel trap or hopeless  It could be your job  your parent  your marriage  or anything  It may mean you need a new job or a new spouse  but it doesn \u2019 t have to  My wife and I spend year work through issue that have nothing to do with my gender expression  It didn \u2019 t make my transgender feeling go away  but it do reduce their intensity  And to reassure you  Vee  it also doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean that the problem be come from the spouse or the employer or the landlord  It could be the way that the trans person approach those relationship  and most likely everyone share some of the blame  The important thing be to figure out what feel hopeless and change it to get the hope back  This be a part of my recommendation to invest in your masculine identity  If your husband have choose to live the rest of his life a a man  Vee  he need to make that a life worth living  It sound like he have a good partner for that in you  I wish you the best of luck  and to all the other nontransitioners and partner out there struggle with this  Other nontransitioners and partner read this  what \u2019 s work for you  What hasn \u2019
