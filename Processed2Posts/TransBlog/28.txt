Obama  Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta sincerely want to help all transgender people  I commend their courage for do what they think will help  But I \u2019 ve read Lynch and Gupta \u2019 s remark and read the brief that Gupta \u2019 s office file in response to the North Carolina lawsuit over bathroom access  and I \u2019 m feeling worry  Where do I  and all the other genderqueer and genderfluid people  fit in this  Will we be leave out  Paragraph 31 from the brief define gender identity a \u201d gender identity  which be an individual \u2019 s internal sense of be male or female \u201d Paragraph 36 state  \u201c Gender identity be innate and external effort to change a person \u2019 s gender identity can be harmful to a person \u2019 s health and wellbeing \u201d That \u2019 s great for someone who live through childhood a a girl  transition in high school and live the rest of their life a a man  It \u2019 s great for someone who live a a boy and then a man  and transition to live a a woman during a midlife crisis  It \u2019 s especially good if they be comfortable interpret their feeling of discomfort  desire and excitement in term of innate brain gender despite the shaky science involve in those construct  Paragraph 36 be less great for someone who doesn \u2019 t want to be pigeonhole into any gender  or for someone who feel like they \u2019 re in between  or a mix of gender  It \u2019 s not so good for someone like me who sometimes feel a desire to be a man and sometimes a woman  who sometimes feel uncomfortable with on gender  or the other  or both  It \u2019 s especially bad if we \u2019 re skeptical of any kind of pat answer  especially about gender  There be a straightforward case against North Carolina \u2019 s HB2 law  just a it \u2019 s illegal to deny a person public accommodation or require her to wear a skirt because she have the legal status of \u201c female  \u201d it \u2019 s illegal to deny a person the right to use the woman \u2019 s room because she have the legal status of \u201c male \u201d It \u2019 s a pattern of sex discrimination  I can understand why Lynch and Gupta don \u2019 t want to use the straightforward argument  though  because it make a baldfaced case that people should be allow to use whichever bathroom they want  even if they \u2019 re not trans  Gupta doesn \u2019 t think the American people be ready for that  Instead  here \u2019 s how she put it  Transgender people be discriminate against because their gender identity do not match the sex they be assign at birth  HB  2 denies transgender people something that all nontransgender people enjoy and take for grant  access to restrooms consistent with their gender identity  For year  whenever anyone talk about \u201c gender identity \u201d I just thought of it a some weird feeling that trans people who transition fulltime have  But then people start insist that everyone have a gender identity  and that because I choose not to live a a woman fulltime I must have a masculine gender identity  They \u2019 re wrong  I don \u2019 t  I just dress like a guy most of the time because it \u2019 s the easy thing to do  It \u2019 s not just me  either  I \u2019 ve know people who \u2019 ve transition and don \u2019 t have a gender identity  Nobody know what my gender identity  or lack thereof  be unless I tell them  and yet they do occasionally discriminate against me  like when the woman in the Burlington Coat Factory on Sixth Avenue send me to the men \u2019 s changing room  She have no idea whether my gender identity match the sex I be assign at birth  she simply decide I be a man despite the fact that I be wear makeup and a skirt  and discriminate against me base on her judgment  Similarly  the people who confront trans people for their choice of bathroom have no idea what gender identity their victim have  They aren \u2019 t discriminate base on a gender identity mismatch  they \u2019 re discriminate base on their gender classification  I can \u2019 t believe that on some level Gupta and Lynch don \u2019 t know this  I don \u2019 t want access to restrooms consistent with my gender identity  and I don \u2019 t think most other trans people do either  I want access to restrooms consistent with my gender expression  It \u2019 s pretty simple  if I \u2019 m wear makeup and heel  I want to go into the bathroom where people with makeup and heel go  If I \u2019 m not wear makeup and have visible facial hair  I want to go into the bathroom where people with no makeup and visible facial hair go  I don \u2019 t vary my gender expression for fun  I do it because through many year of experience I \u2019 ve conclude that my mental health suffers if I don \u2019 t  My need be just a real  and just a unchangeable  a any other trans person \u2019 s  I \u2019 m just not confident enough in my understanding of my own mind  or in the state of neuroscience  to assert that this be a result of some innate sense of self  So here \u2019 s what I want to know  Attorney General Lynch  if I don \u2019 t have a gender identity  innate or otherwise  and I \u2019 m not prepared to assert that my state be innate  do you still stand with me  Do you stand with the genderqueer person who doesn \u2019 t really pass in any bathroom  and decides which be the safest on an ad hoc basis  If I get arrest in a woman \u2019 s room in North Carolina  in makeup and a dress  would you do everything you could to protect me  Or be safe access to restrooms only for people with a gender identity  Update  Cristan Williams point out that the Justice Department be sue North Carolina because they receive grant under the Violence Against Women Act that be condition on state not discriminate on the basis of gender identity  But a I point out shortly after the Act be reauthorized in 2013  the definition of gender identity be \u201c actual or perceive genderrelated characteristic  \u201d which be a lot more inclusive and effective than the faithbased definition  So why be Lynch and Gupta use a definition of gender identity that \u2019 s so radically different from the one in the law  ", "feedtitle": "Page 3 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
