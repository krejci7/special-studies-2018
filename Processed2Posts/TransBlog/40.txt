["Articles", "Categorization", "passing"], "text": "Since the early day of medical transition  people have remark that there be difference between trans people who transition and those of u who don \u2019 t  Often this be ascribe to a difference of essence  some believe they can divide maletofemale trans people into the \u201c true transsexual \u201d who be essentially woman with a destiny to transition  and \u201c just crossdresser \u201d who be essentially men  I \u2019 m go to focus on the \u201c feminine spectrum \u201d for this post  but there be similar claim make for femaletomale trans people  Nobody have yet find a foolproof test for this essence of femininity or masculinity  What people use instead be a gut feeling  the supposedly real trans woman just \u201c feel like woman  \u201d even without make an effort to present a woman  while the supposedly fake trans woman \u201c feel like men \u201d Many trans people stress these claim difference  They argue that nontransitioners who look like \u201c men in dress \u201d give true trans woman a bad name and claim protection they don \u2019 t deserve  My experience have run pretty much counter to those claim  I have meet trans woman who transition decade ago but \u201c feel \u201d like men to me  and trans woman who have never transition but \u201c feel \u201d like woman  I myself have never transition  but when I present a a woman anyone who doesn \u2019 t know me but know I \u2019 m trans assume that I transition long ago  If you talk to anyone who believe in this \u201c gut feeling \u201d and show them these counterexample  they will explain them away with circular reasoning  A transitioned trans woman who \u201c feel like a man \u201d be an impostor who should never have transition  and people like me be just in denial and will change our mind pretty soon  There be a simple explanation for this discrepancy between \u201c gut feeling \u201d and reality  there be no essential gender  But the \u201c gut feeling \u201d be not always wrong  Where do it come from  If we examine it  what we find be a more subtle form of passing  one that work even if the observer know whether the person be trans  There be no need to assume some inner gender  all the normal passing factor be enough to explain it  Some people just get the luck of the gene draw  Shorter people with narrow shoulder and mouth  broad hip  small hand  foot and brow ridge  and high voice tend to feel more \u201c naturally \u201d feminine  while tall people with broad shoulder and mouth  narrow hip  big hand  foot and brow ridge  and low voice tend to feel more \u201c naturally \u201d masculine  Age play a huge role  The effect of hormone on secondary sex characteristic don \u2019 t stop at puberty  Trans woman who transition early in life will have narrow shoulder and broad hip  while trans woman who transition late  or never transition  will have broad shoulder and narrow hip  Body modification and groom be a relevant for this \u201c feeling \u201d a for the betterknown form of pass  People who have commit to a transition be more likely to get surgery  hair removal and hair transplant  These treatment be just as artificial a wig or heavy makeup  but often less noticeable  One of the big factor be socialization  Mannerisms be just habit  and habit develop with experience  Someone who spend a lot of time around woman and be treat like a woman will act like the woman around them and \u201c feel \u201d like a woman  and someone who spend a lot of time around men and be treat like a man will act like the men around them and \u201c feel \u201d like a man  These effect be cumulative  the more time a person spend live in one gender  the more naturally they interact with others in that gender  Some trans woman have point out that their socialization be not like typical male socialization  I agree  but I don \u2019 t think they be socialize female  either  There be fine grain of male socialization  we be socialize a girly boy  nerdy boy  gay boy and others  When we get older we can be socialize a gay men  This mean we be give the space  or take the space  to speak and gesture more softly  take a role model soft men  gay men  or woman  These difference may be felt by some a cue that we be \u201c really \u201d girl or woman  There \u2019 s another kind of socialization a well  trans socialization  I know a lot of trans woman who socialize primarily with other trans woman  This may be out of choice  or because they \u2019 ve be reject by nontrans people  or because they \u2019 re afraid of be reject or bad  If a whole bunch of trans woman spend most of their time together  they \u2019 re go to wind up move and sound like each other  and like their idea of woman  If none of them have any significant female socialization apart from that  then they may not \u201c feel \u201d like woman to other people  Some trans people be just good actor or good mimic  and be able to move and sound like their target gender  Does that mean that they \u2019 re less \u201c real \u201d than other trans people  Maybe  maybe not  Sometimes you have to fake it \u2019 till you make it  Some may have a strong desire to sound or move differently from the way they do before  On the other hand  some may feel uncomfortable with any change in the way they move or sound  Between gene  age  body modification  groom  socialization  alienation and just plain good acting  there be plenty of explanation for why some trans woman \u201c feel \u201d like woman  some trans men \u201c feel \u201d like men  and some don \u2019 t  There be no mystical essence of gender  no \u201c brain sex \u201d require to explain this  If you \u2019 ve pin your hope on the idea of be a \u201c woman trap in a man \u2019 s body  \u201d you may not like this idea  On the other hand  thinking of this \u201c feeling \u201d a just another form of pass mean that people who have some of these factor go against them may be able to eventually overcome them and \u201c pas by feeling \u201d It also mean that those of u who have some of the factor in our favor can decide whether or not we want to transition base on what work for u  not whether we \u201c feel like a woman \u201d to someone else  ", "feedtitle": "Page 4 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
