intense emotion that many transgender people experience around a significant event  I use to get it when I try on a new outfit  particularly a kind that I have fantasize about  when I be a teenager  that involve short skirt and nylon   Now it mostly happen when I go out in public presenting a a woman  This excitement be relative  and it depend on how much I \u2019 m use to the activity  If I haven \u2019 t crossdressed at all in month  I may feel some gender fog just at crossdressing  The same thing for shave or haircut  or new outfit  If I \u2019 ve be crossdress a lot  and shave and maybe even get new outfit on a regular basis  I don \u2019 t get a excite  Since I haven \u2019 t be go out crossdressed very much lately  just go out can bring on very intense euphoria  For me  gender fog generally start as soon a I make plan to go out  I get insomnia  where instead of sleep I lie in bed think about what I \u2019 m go to wear  where I \u2019 m go to change  whether I \u2019 m go to meet up with anyone  when I \u2019 m go to leave  where I \u2019 m go to shop and what I \u2019 m go to buy  whether I \u2019 ll have a meal  and so forth  I dwell on potential problem  mostly around passing  be my makeup technique good enough to cover my beard  Is my belly too big  Are my shoulder too broad  Will it be too hot to wear a dress that flatters my figure  Have I be practice my voice enough  Will my sinus be clear enough  When I finish change and actually go out in public  I usually get very excited  Then  since whatever activity I do in public last several hour  otherwise it \u2019 s not really worth put on all the makeup   at some point in the day or evening I \u2019 ll feel kind of tired or bore  and think  \u201c I could be do this in guy clothes  and it \u2019 d be a lot easier \u201d But then there will usually be something else interesting or fun that happen  I \u2019 m typically tire at the end of the trip  and sometimes I sleep very well for several night afterwards  The postevent gender fog usually involve some experience that make me happy  usually because it confirm my role a a woman  Because of this  many of these involve pass or acceptance  I get a cute outfit  I use my female voice for the first time  A guard direct me to the woman \u2019 s room in Rockefeller Center  A waiter flirt with me  A transitioned trans woman briefly think I be a nontrans woman  A woman compliment my look  I go to an interesting part of the city or event that I \u2019 d never be to a a woman  Or maybe it be just the experience of walk through the city  be accept a one of the woman  After the experience  I find myself dwell on it  think about how I could repeat or extend it  If I get a cute outfit  I think about wear it at home  or on a future out  Maybe I think about future outfit  If it \u2019 s an interaction  I think about other interaction  If it \u2019 s a place  I think about go back to that place  or to other place  I also may think about thing that be timeconsuming or inconvenient  and about way that I could make them easy  If I have a really good time or if I do something really new for me  I may be high for day  think about nothing but my experience  My wife and friend get really tire of hear about it  I have trouble concentrate at work  I may plan to go out again  sooner than I have originally think  I may think about more \u201c soft body mod  \u201d like ear piercing  grow my hair or permanent leg or facial hair removal  The gender fog always last for several day after the event  Usually I use ten day a a rule of thumb  although if I ever go out more than once in a tenday period the excitement be compound  Yesterday I go out in public  and I \u2019 m definitely feel the gender fog  It \u2019 s not as intense a it have be at some time  I have trouble sleep the night before  and I be expect to sleep good last night  but I have similar difficulty  On the other hand  my difficulty sleeping may be unrelated to this experience  I \u2019 ve be have insomnia lately anyway  and the heat doesn \u2019 t help  Some of you may be scoff at this  If you transition year ago and have be live a quiet life a your target gender  then yes you probably don \u2019 t have experience like this  Similarly if you \u2019 ve get a stable genderqueer or genderfluid existence  If you \u2019 re transition then your outing be probably more extensive  frequent and social than my shopping trip  But I \u2019 ve see transitioners have similar reaction to other milestone  particularly relate to hormonal body modification and legal and social acceptance  I \u2019 m guessing that you \u2019 ve all have some feeling like this  ", "feedtitle": "Page 12 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
