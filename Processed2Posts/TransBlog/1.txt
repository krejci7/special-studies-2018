national I be Jazz reading event  where people will gather in school and community center to read the child \u2019 s book by transgender teenager Jazz Jennings  a tell to Jessica Herthel and beautifully illustrate by Shelagh McNicholas  As a trans person myself who be a gender nonconforming child I appreciate the intent behind the reading  but I frankly hate the book  and I really wish they would find something else to read  Let \u2019 s think about what we want to accomplish by read kid a book about transgender issue  First  we want to teach kid to accept and support any classmate who might be trans  Second  we want to give kid the understanding and good habit to accept and support trans people when they grow up  Third  we want to send a signal to any trans kid in the audience that they be accept and support  The HRC say as much in their press release  So how do I Am Jazz do  Well  let \u2019 s start by go over the plot  such a it be  Jazz love girly thing  because Jazz be a girl in a boy \u2019 s body  Jazz have lot of friend who be girl  and they have lot of fun do girly thing together  In term of plot  it \u2019 s no Cat in the Hat  It isn \u2019 t even Go Dog  Go  The only action be Jazz and her friend play soccer  and that happen mostly off the page  Everything be static  habitual  Jazz be  She like thing  She have friend  She and her friend like to do thing  The end  Jazz be expertly draw a a pretty girl who may inspire some desire in other girl  if I be open to have a trans friend  these girl will think  she might turn out to be like Jazz  and then we could be pretty and girly together  Herthel write that she be inspire to write the book when her daughter have just such a reaction on meeting Jazz  On the other hand  there be nothing here for boyish boy and tomboyish girl  They may be turn off by Jazz \u2019 s focus on all thing girly  and anyone who might have be think of her a a messedup boy ripe for bully would not be deter by anything they read in the book  When I be a kid  I just want to be able to do whatever look like fun  include dancing and play with doll and have tea party as well a tree climbing and toy truck  and not really soccer   I want to wear whatever looked cool and comfortable  include skirt and tights and barrette and lipstick as well a baseball cap and jean  I want to stay friend with the girl in my life  and I didn \u2019 t want to chase them a part of some bizarre dominance ritual  When I be a teenager I felt a desire to be a pretty  girly girl  but I didn \u2019 t necessarily want to give up be a boy  and a a young adult I choose to become and stay a man  I \u2019 m have trouble imagine that a kid \u2013 or a parent  or a teacher \u2013 would be any more sympathetic to my want or choice after read I be Jazz than before  I didn \u2019 t want to be a stereotypical boy  but I didn \u2019 t want to be like Jazz either  When I be a little old  a part of me want to be like Jazz  but another part of me didn \u2019 t  and ultimately I \u2019 m glad I didn \u2019 t spend time a a girl in high school  Where be there anything like my life in I be Jazz  How do it even lead to people understand me  much less accept or support me  In case you think I want to replace a ceremony that \u2019 s all about Jazz with one that \u2019 s all about me  it \u2019 s also hard to imagine that see Jazz be successful at be a pretty  girly girl would make kid more open to masculinespectrum transgender or nonbinary kid  whether they \u2019 re transitioning or gender nonconforming  We need something that include all of u  The best thing I \u2019 ve ever read  or heard  on this subject be a book and record  and television special  that my sister use to play when I be a kid  Marlo Thomas \u2019 s Free to Be\u2026 You and Me  It have a ton of piece that address all kind of gender nonconformity  include a musical adaptation of another book  William \u2019 s Doll  sung by Alan Alda  In keep with HRC \u2019 s early mission  Thomas say that ABC executive \u201c want \u2018 William \u2019 s Doll \u2019 cut  because it would turn every boy in the world into a homosexual \u2014 which isn \u2019 t such a bad idea \u201d  There be nothing at all about sexuality in \u201c Wiliam \u2019 s Doll \u201d \u2013 Thomas be joke   I \u2019 d love to see new book for kid about transgender issue  but until we have them  I \u2019 d be happy to take part in school and community reading of Free to Be \u2026 You and Me  \u201c Boy Meets Girl \u201d and \u201c William \u2019 s Doll \u201d be just as powerful a they be back in 1972  I \u2019 m guessing there be a lot of kid who could benefit from hear a grown man sing \u201c It \u2019 s All Right to Cry \u201d in front of their class  And the final line of Dan Greenburg \u2019 s \u201c Don \u2019 t Dress Your Cat in an Apron \u201d really say it all  A person should wear what he want to  And not just what other folk say  A person should do what she like to  A person \u2019 s a person that way  ", "feedtitle": "Trans Blog"}
