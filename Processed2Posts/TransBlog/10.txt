["Articles", "Media", "Violence"], "text": "Lots of people be talk about the New York Times opinion piece  \u201c My Daughter Is Not Transgender  She \u2019 s a Tomboy \u201d by Lisa Selin Davis and the response to it  I be particularly frustrate with a Medium piece from Chase Strangio  Strangio attack Davis and her argument from several angle  but the bad be when he privilegeshames her and essentially accuse her of incite trans murder  But connect  question gender expression  to the affirmation of trans young people in their gender be reckless and dangerous and wrong  Trans youth be die because society be tell them  tell u  that we be fake  Trans woman and femmes of color be be murder because the impulse be to believe that transness be fraudulent  that our body be threat  Strangio be a white trans man  not a trans woman or a femme of color  so it \u2019 s disingenuous right off the bat for him to refer to \u201c our bodies \u201d It be not typically body like his \u2013 or even body like mine \u2013 that threaten people so much they kill  Strangio be technically correct that some trans woman have be murder because people think they be be deceitful  but to simplify the cause of violence against black and latina trans woman to accusation of fraud be a gross distortion of the problem  This violence be intersectional  it be mostly direct at people who be see a nonwhite  poor  immigrant  transgender  feminine  \u201c gay  \u201d and sex worker  Nonwhite poor immigrant feminine gay sex worker who aren \u2019 t see a trans face a level of violence that be barely distinguishable from that face by those who be trans  Nonwhite trans woman be more likely to be poor and sex worker  Not because they \u2019 re see a deceiver  but because many of them be already in financially precarious position  and then their family tend to throw them out for wear woman \u2019 s clothes  This drive them deeper into poverty and force them to choose between sex work and hunger  When a john accuse a transgender sex worker of \u201c be a man  \u201d he \u2019 s not just accuse her of romantic deception  if even that   he \u2019 s accuse her of fraudulent business practice  Sex worker get kill base on small accusation  Poor community in the United States tend to be less accept of homosexual relationship than middleclass one  which put pressure on anyone who might be see be involve with a trans woman  If a man be see a gay  that can lead to loss of social standing  ostracism and harassment  And if he \u2019 s see interact with a trans woman  people in those community will label him a gay  Some courageous men stand up to that kind of attack  but many others will take it out on the trans woman  Strangio come to this with an agenda  he want himself and every trans person to be able to assert a gender without be question  I too want to be able to wear a dress without someone shout \u201c you \u2019 re a man  \u201d at me \u2013 or even target me with microaggressions  But let \u2019 s assume we could bring about Strangio \u2019 s vision of the world  where everyone could simply state their gender and receive title to all the role  space and relationship associate with it  Who \u2019 s to say that all the dissatisfied john and intolerant parent out there wouldn \u2019 t just move the goalpost and say that it \u2019 s okay to beat or kill a sex worker who doesn \u2019 t advertise that she have a penis  or to cast out a child who abruptly assert a new sex without ask  Still  let \u2019 s assume that somehow by legislate acceptance of gender declaration we can somehow prevent nonwhite  poor and immigrant teenager from be throw out of their family home and kill for be feminine and trans  They still may wind up a sex worker because they \u2019 re poor  and they still may wind up get kill because they \u2019 re poor  nonwhite andor immigrant  Strangio seem to hint that question people \u2019 s gender be tie up in white supremacy  but he doesn \u2019 t explain how  This lecture on privilege be write by a white lawyer with a large readership work for a nationally renowned nonprofit  and widely share even a he lament that his Medium page be \u201c lesserread \u201d than the New York Times  If Strangio have really want to center the challenge face by poor  nonwhite trans woman  why didn \u2019 t he just link to a post by a poor  nonwhite trans woman  If he couldn \u2019 t find anything write in response to the article by poor  nonwhite trans woman  why didn \u2019 t he encourage some of his nonwhite transfeminine friend to write response and then promote them  This be not about nonwhite trans woman  My feeling be that Strangio find the article threaten for any number of reason  so he fight back by say one of the bad thing you can say in his circle  privilege  But here \u2019 s the problem  Strangio be a white professional man criticize a woman  which be one of the most privileged position you can be in  His trans background be not really enough to overcome the gender difference  and he know it  So he invoke the suffering of black and latina trans woman  Can we please not do this  We should absolutely be talk about the murder of trans woman and femmes  and what we can do to prevent them  And on this issue we should be let the people most affected speak  and listen to what they say  as much a possible  But we should not be drag this issue into an argument between two assignedfemale white professional over a white assignedfemale child  ", "feedtitle": "Trans Blog"}
