Wednesday for their Pride Week  Looking over my Skeptical Trans 101 page and imagine how someone in college today would read it  I realize that I \u2019 ve learn a lot since I originally write it almost four year ago  so I update it  Here \u2019 s the new version  Why it \u2019 s okay to be skeptical about transgender politics  while still be respectful  As Jamison Green say  \u201c There be NOT one way to be trans \u201d A story about a single person win \u2019 t tell you about everyone  Lots of people hide their trans belief  feeling and action  We don \u2019 t know about them  Anything about transgender issue that contain \u201c most  \u201d \u201c all \u201d or any percentage be probably wrong  We don \u2019 t hold election  Any person talk to you about their transgender belief  feeling or action be not authorize to speak on behalf of anyone else  Brain science be not at a point where it can tell u anything reliable  Anything about transgender issue that talk about specific part of the brain be probably wrong  People be not reliable \u2013 about transgender issue or anything else  Most people desperately want to be normal  and be willing to lie to themselves and everyone else to feel normal  Anything that make anyone look normal be probably wrong  Your beliefs \u2013 about gender and everything else \u2013 be your own  Don \u2019 t let anyone tell you what to believe  How we use gender  Every society we know of assigns people to gender  Usually this be \u201c man \u201d or \u201c woman  \u201d depend on the way their genitals look at birth  Some society have a third gender that involve a combination of the role of the male and female gender  Most people have the habit of classify everyone they meet into one gender or another  Often this be reflect in aspect of language such a pronoun  Some language  like French  even assign gender to inanimate object  Classifying people be a mean to an end  Classifying people by gender be a way to figure out whether a person will be safe  a good mate  a good worker  or even someone vulnerable  There will always be many exception  Every society we know of reserve certain role  space and relationship for the exclusive use of one gender or the other  such a job  bathroom and marriage  In these situation  gender be always a shortcut for some harderto measure criterion  like strength or the ability to bear child  Every society we know of have gender expression  way that people identify themselves a one gender or another  Some of these be behavioral  involve habit of speaking or move  Others involve clothing  accessory and groom  Many people fight over gender category  particularly over who get any benefit associate with belong to one category or another  and who get to speak for one gender or another  How we react to gender  Everyone have feeling about their gender  Many people have gender dysphoria  discomfort with the gender they be assign  Many people have transgender desire  a desire to be a gender different from the one assign to them  Some people experience gender fog  an intense excitement associate with a significant gender event  Everyone have beliefs about their own gender  Some people have transgender belief that conflict with other people \u2019 s expectation  Some people take transgender action  they be assign to one gender but take on expression  space and role that conflict with other people \u2019 s expectation  These gender expression may include modify their body in various way  These transgender action be not new  We find them describe for every society  in every time period  Some bad news about gender  Some people attack other people for take transgender action  Some people reject their own child for transgender action  Some people discriminate against people for take transgender action  Some people commit suicide over the intensity of their transgender feeling  or action  Some people take transgender action and then regret them  If you have transgender feeling or belief  There be NOT one way to be trans  Base your decision for your action on how you want to live your life  not on a category  Gender fog can impair a person \u2019 s ability to make decision  Avoid make longterm decision while in a gender fog  You don \u2019 t need to change your gender classification to come out a transgender  It \u2019 s good to experiment with gender  but some experiment can change you permanently  and others can give you unreliable information  If you \u2019 ve decide not to change your gender classification  be aware that take certain action might undermine that decision  How to respect gender  You will meet people who have strong feeling about their gender  Be sympathetic  You will meet people whose belief about their gender differ from yours  Respect their belief  and expect that they will respect yours  You will meet people who express gender differently from the way you expect  Respect them  Live and let live  You will meet people who want you to address and refer to them a a different gender than you might otherwise  Honor their desire  You will meet people who you would normally assign to one gender  but who want to take on role and space that your society reserve for a different gender  Respect their wish and accommodate them as much a possible  You will meet people whose sexuality interact with gender in unfamiliar way  Respect them  You may be tempt to say something negative or mocking of transgender feeling or action  Think about how that might be hear  Think about your fellow human being  How to help  Some people spin myth about transgender feeling  thought and action  Some of the most destructive myth be spin by people who be try to help  Be skeptical  while still be respectful  There be NOT one way to be trans  Don \u2019 t assume everyone with transgender feeling will take the same action  Dealing with transgender feeling be hard  Offer support  but not advice unless ask   We hear lot of nasty thing about people who violate gender norm  Say a few nice thing  Some people attack people who violate gender norm  Protect people from these attack  and speak out against attack  Some people discriminate against people who violate gender norm  Help balance that out  It \u2019 s hard for people to find love  Consider love someone who do gender differently  ", "feedtitle": "Page 2
