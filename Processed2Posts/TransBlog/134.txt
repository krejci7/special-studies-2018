some message ask me to press for transgender and lesbian  gay and bisexual inclusion in the Violence Against Women Act  a law that sunsets regularly but have just be reauthorized by Congress  The action alert also talk about \u201c gender identity  \u201d and the definition that come to mind be this one from GLAAD  which be echo in other definition around the country  \u201c One \u2019 s internal  personal sense of be a man or a woman  or a boy or a girl   \u201d Photo  UltraVioletorgI be concern about the use of \u201c gender identity \u201d in this bill  Being white and middleclass I \u2019 m at relatively low risk  but there be other trans people from all ethnic and economic background who occasionally go out in public presenting a woman  with male body unmodified by hormone or surgical treatment  and without a strong belief that we be woman  We may be see by others a woman  a trans people or a gay men  We may be target for sexual assault  stalk or other violent action base on those perception  A law that be base on the \u201c internal sense \u201d definition of gender identity would fail to protect u  Today I take a closer look and discover that this fight actually be relevant to people like me  The Violence Against Women Act  originally pass in 1994  provide grant for nonprofit and government agency to run program aim at prevent violence against woman and provide support for woman who be victim of domestic and sexual violence  The expanded version of the law pass by the Senate last year  but reject by the House of Representatives  and then pass this week by both house of Congress  include new protection that weren \u2019 t in the original bill  Overall  it include \u201c date violence \u201d and \u201c stalk \u201d a eligible category of violence in addition to \u201c domestic violence \u201d and \u201c sexual assault \u201d It also include provision for \u201c men  woman  and youth in correctional and detention settings \u201d One part that relate to transgender and LGB victim be the definition of \u201c underserved populations \u201d There be grant for organization work with underserved population  UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS\u2014The term \u201c underserved population \u201d mean population who face barrier in access and use victim service  and include population underserved because of geographic location  religion  sexual orientation  gender identity  underserved racial and ethnic population  population underserved because of special need  such a language barrier  disability  alienage status  or age   and any other population determine to be underserved by the Attorney General or by the Secretary of Health and Human Services  a appropriate  Another section expand the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include support for the following  developing  enlarge  or strengthen program and project to provide service and response target male and female victim of domestic violence  date violence  sexual assault  or stalking  whose ability to access traditional service and response be affect by their sexual orientation or gender identity  a define in section 249  c  of title 4 18  United States Code In section 249  c  of the hate crime law be where we actually get a legal definition of \u201c gender identity  \u201d and it turn out to be very different from that give by organization like GLAAD  the term \u2018 gender identity \u2019 mean actual or perceive genderrelated characteristic This definition be much broad than the \u201c internal sense \u201d definition  but do a good job of delineate the class of victim who be underserved  and who be often actually deny service when people perceive them a \u201c queer \u201d or \u201c trannies  \u201d with no knowledge of their internal sense of gender  The people who refuse to investigate or prosecute crime against transgender people don \u2019 t give a rat \u2019 s as what internal  personal sense of gender those transgender people have  If I  or someone like me who \u2019 s black or Mexican  get bash and a cop win \u2019 t write it up  tell the cop that I really don \u2019 t have an internal  personal sense that I \u2019 m a woman isn \u2019 t go to get me any good treatment  That \u2019 s probably why the definition in the hate crime law didn \u2019 t reference a sense of gender  and why this expand Violence Against Women Act doesn \u2019 t either  A final note  in the spirit of the Delhi protester who say \u201c Don \u2019 t tell your daughter to stay at home  instead teach your son to behave  \u201d I like this program in the new Violence Against Women Act  ENGAGING MEN AS LEADERS AND ROLE MODELS\u2014To develop  maintain or enhance program that work with men to prevent domestic violence  date violence  sexual assault  and stalk by help men to serve a role model and social influencers of other men and youth at the individual  school  community or statewide level  ", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 Trans
