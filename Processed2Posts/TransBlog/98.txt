["Articles", "Categorization"], "text": "I \u2019 ve write about how I don \u2019 t feel nonbinary because I jump from one side of the binary to the other  But that \u2019 s not all of it  my masculine gender expression  of the two  the one that \u2019 s best develop  be not very binary  and never have be  But I don \u2019 t feel like that part be exceptionally non binary  Everyone \u2019 s action be non binary to one degree or another  I \u2019 ve just be more comfortable with my non binary action than a lot of other people  The reason we draw line between men and woman be to decide who get access to what role and space  what we expect from people  and how we \u2019 re go to treat them  But no matter where we draw the line between men and woman  most people be not go to fit perfectly on one side or the other  I \u2019 ve meet a lot of people over the year  and when you get to know them  everyone be pretty nonbinary  Do I look nonbinary to you  As I write this I \u2019 m wear all \u201c men \u2019 s \u201d clothes and accessory  buy in the Men \u2019 s department  I have my fingernail cut short  and I shave my facial hair use a men \u2019 s razor  I \u2019 m not wear makeup  I \u2019 m go to my job a a university professor  Tomorrow I will go to my research position in computer science  a continuation of my many year work in information technology  All role and space that have traditionally be \u201c men \u2019 s \u201d in middleclass white American society  I \u2019 m do a lot of thing that be unmarked for gender  I \u2019 m drink a latte and rid the subway  I \u2019 m write on a tablet  I \u2019 m carry a backpack  I get together with friend  I go to political meeting  I post on Facebook and Twitter and Tumblr and my blog  In my life a a \u201c guy  \u201d I do some thing that have traditionally be \u201c woman \u2019 s work \u201d Tonight I \u2019 m go to meet with my kid \u2019 s teacher  Sometimes my wife go on business trip and I \u2019 m take care of the kid by myself for day on end  When he be a baby I feed him and change his diaper  I buy almost all of my own clothes  Yesterday I do laundry  for the entire family  On Friday I \u2019 ll cook dinner  and probably buy grocery  Tomorrow I might clean the bathroom and go to Weight Watchers  I \u2019 ll eat salad  When I be young I work a a secretary and ate Special K cereal  I \u2019 ve study yoga and dance  All traditionally woman \u2019 s role  Of course  I \u2019 ve know woman who wear no makeup  who wear \u201c men \u2019 s \u201d clothes  who trim their fingernail and even shave their face  I have always have plenty of colleague who be woman  in university teaching  in computer science  and in information technology  There be lot of woman in university teaching  but in other part of the country it \u2019 s still unusual for a woman to be pay to open up a computer  I know other guy who take care of their kid  include the feeding and diaper  I be tell once that a particular temp agency in another city would not send men on secretarial assignment  but here in New York I meet a number of other male secretary  When I \u2019 ve travel  most of the Weight Watchers meeting I \u2019 ve be to have be dominate by woman  but here I see men at practically every meeting  Most of the guy I know buy their own clothes  and a lot of them wash the family \u2019 s clothes and clean the bathroom and cook dinner  Whenever I study yoga or dance  there be other guy there  I see guy at Just Salad  and maybe even eat Special K This mean a lot of people cross traditional gender boundary  I do know some people who be pretty damn conventional about gender role  Women who never wear pant outside the house  men who win \u2019 t touch a stove  People who repeat thing that sound like they \u2019 re straight out of some Victorian etiquette guide  But when I \u2019 ve get to know these people  there \u2019 s always something surprising about them  A woman who start her own business  A man who raise his kid without a woman in the house  Every single one  I \u2019 ve never meet someone who fit completely within standard gender norm  Now here \u2019 s a problem  essentialist stance on gender rely on binary policing  Whether you say  \u201c all male be men \u201d or \u201c trans woman be woman  \u201d you \u2019 re say that it matter who \u2019 s a man and who \u2019 s a woman  Not that it matter for some practical sense  like bathroom access  but that beyond all practicality  it matter to you  Otherwise you \u2019 d just say that everyone should be allow to use the bathroom they choose  This be a problem because of all the non binary action I describe  all the people who don \u2019 t necessarily identify a \u201c non binary \u201d or transgender  but do thing that cross gender boundary  No matter where you place the boundary  some people will cross it  and some will be straddle it  Any essentialist approach to gender base on birth assignment will necessarily leave a lot of people unsatisfied  An essentialist  binary approach base on socialization will still erase a lot of people by ignore the messy gray area of socialization  An essentialist approach base on professed belief or the observer \u2019 s gut feeling  which be the only evidence ever accept for \u201c gender identity \u201d  ignores and era my reality  and really  everyone else \u2019 s  even if they profess a gender identity  because everyone cross gender boundary  So here be my question to everyone who believe that there be essential difference between men and woman  whether by birth assignment  socialization  professed belief  or your personal judgment  When you divide the world of people into men and woman  which roles  space and treatment be reserve for one gender or the other  and which be open to all  Does your definition allow my reality  Who would violate your category  What be the consequence  ", "feedtitle": "Page 10 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
