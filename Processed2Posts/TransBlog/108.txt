I describe Janet Mock \u2019 s vision of a world where trans woman will no longer be kill because everyone will see them a woman  My friend didn \u2019 t even let me finish before she put her finger on one huge problem with Mock \u2019 s idea  it only apply to a small subset of potential victim  Vince Neil  the dude in questionAs we \u2019 ve see  this exact same scenario \u2013 boy meet girl  boy decide that girl be \u201c a man  \u201d boy be afraid someone will call him \u201c gay  \u201d boy attack girl \u2013 doesn \u2019 t just happen with \u201c trans women \u201d It happen to people like B Scott  include when he identify a a gay man  and it happen to people like Bimbo Winehouse  who identify a a man but want to be see a a woman part of the time  It happen to people who aren \u2019 t even present a a woman  It even happen to guy who aren \u2019 t gay at all but simply be mistake for gay  like Ever Orozco  who be kill earlier this week  It \u2019 s pretty clear what the problem be  men lose status if someone think they \u2019 re gay  they \u2019 re afraid of that  so they try to prove they \u2019 re not by attack the person they be attract to  What my friend object to be that Mock \u2019 s vision doesn \u2019 t do anything about the underlying problem  It doesn \u2019 t make it any easy for potential target who really be gay or straight men and don \u2019 t wear woman \u2019 s clothes  It doesn \u2019 t make it easy for people who identify a crossdressing men  With it relentless hammering on the \u201c trans woman be woman \u201d dogma  it doesn \u2019 t even help people who be view and accept a woman but be reluctant to claim that category for political reason  It just attempt to draw a charmed circle around people who be willing to claim the status of \u201c woman  \u201d and those who be attract to them  And of course it doesn \u2019 t protect any of u from the violence that be regularly direct at woman  Now I want to look at another vision of a good world  There be a fascinating article by Sue Kerr about the story behind the Aerosmith song \u201c Dude  Looks Like a Lady   \u201d I remember when that song come out  I wasn \u2019 t an Aerosmith fan  and i didn \u2019 t listen to the lyric  The refrain sound like a distress call  the video be boring  and I didn \u2019 t want to be a dude that look like a lady  I want to be a lady  or at least a girl  I change the channel whenever it come on MTV  The backstory be interesting  though  songwriter Desmond Child tell SongFacts about a conversation with Steve Tyler  \u201c He get the idea because they have go to a bar and have see a girl at the end of the bar with ginormous blonde rock hair  and the girl turn around and it end up be Vince Neil from Motley Crue \u201d Tyler come up with the line  \u201c Dude look like a lady \u201d and eventually share it with Child  an out gay man who have be hire by their record label to improve their songwriting  Child like the line so much he make it the title of the song  Here \u2019 s the kicker  And then Joe  Perry  step in and say  \u201c I don \u2019 t want to insult the gay community \u201d I say  \u201c Okay  I \u2019 m gay  and I \u2019 m not insult  Let \u2019 s write this song \u201d So I talk them into the whole scenario of a guy that walk into a strip joint and fall in love with the stripper on stage  go backstage and find out it \u2019 s a guy  But besides that  he \u2019 s gon na go with it  He say  \u201c My funky lady  I like it  like it  like it like that \u201d And so he doesn \u2019 t run out of there  he stay  Note that the narrator be attract enough to go to bed with her  even though he continue to classify the stripper a a \u201c dude  \u201d and say \u201c Ooh  he be a lady \u201d I wouldn \u2019 t be surprise if Child base it on a friend or acquaintance  Both the real and fictionalized story bear some resemblance to the Kinks \u2019 1970 hit \u201c Lola  \u201d which I hear a lot on the radio  It \u2019 s never be my favorite Kinks song  but I do listen to the lyric  The narrator be ambivalent about how to categorize Lola \u2013 there \u2019 s the famous line \u201c I \u2019 m a man  I \u2019 m a man  and so be Lola  \u201d but he use \u201c she \u201d pronoun throughout  The backstory to \u201c Lola \u201d be just a interesting  Dave Davies recall that he be inspire by a party at the home of band manager Robert Wace  \u201c In his apartment  Robert have be dance with this black woman  and he say  \u2018 I \u2019 m really onto a thing here \u2019 And it be okay until we leave at six in the morning and then I say  \u2018 Have you see the stubble  \u2019 He say \u2018 Yeah  \u2019 but he be too pissed  intoxicate  to care  I think \u201d Contrast \u201c Lola \u201d and \u201c Dude Looks Like a Lady \u201d with another song from the eighty  Tone L   333c \u2019 s \u201c Funky Cold Medina \u201d In the third verse the narrator give the eponymous aphrodisiac to sexy Sheena  but to his surprise  \u201c Sheena be a man  \u201d So I throw him out  I don \u2019 t fool around with no Oscar Mayer wiener  You must be sure that your girl be pure for the Funky Cold Medina  Know what I \u2019 m sayin \u2019  Ain \u2019 t no playin \u2019 with a man  This be the eighty  and L   333c be down with the lady  no joke   As I be put this post together I come across another post by Andrea James that also mention \u201c Funky Cold Medina \u201d James hit on some good point  but I want to go in a slightly different direction   \u201c Lola \u201d explore the ambiguity of gender and end by categorize Lola a a man  but the final message emphasize her humanity and the narrator \u2019 s affection for her  implicitly conclude that there \u2019 s nothing wrong or unmanly with be attract to a \u201c man  \u201d especially if you \u2019 re really plaster  \u201c Dude Looks Like a Lady \u201d echo the alarm over the stripper \u2019 s unexpected dudeness  but end by affirm her ladyhood and sexiness  In \u201c Funky Cold Medina  \u201d think  Tone L   333c responds to Sheena \u2019 s manhood with callous rejection  but not violence   \u201c Lola \u201d and \u201c Funky Cold Medina \u201d both explore the question of what it mean to be attract to a \u201c man \u201d The narrator of \u201c Lola \u201d be naive and inexperienced  and Lola in fact offer to \u201c make you a man  \u201d by give him his first sexual experience  Whether or not this happen be leave to the listener \u2019 s imagination  but the narrator eventually conclude that he can be a man even if Lola be too  Tone L   333c make it a point to reassure everyone that he \u2019 s \u201c down with the ladies \u201d It \u2019 s hard not to notice that African Americans be vastly overrepresented in any list of trans people murder in this country  Correlation be not causation  and it \u2019 s important not to discount factor like poverty  discrimination and civic neglect  but I think everyone agree that American black culture be more intolerant of homosexuality and transgender action than white culture  What if a few male black cultural leader \u2013 singer and rapper  but maybe also athletes  politician and religious leader \u2013 follow the lead of white guy like Dave Davies and Steven Tyler  and black woman like Tyra Banks  What if a famous  respected black man spend some of his cultural capital to tell the world that he think trans people be sexy  and he \u2019 s not afraid of anyone find out  I know how this might sound to some people  but I \u2019 m not say \u201c do this because white people do it \u201d I \u2019 m say give it a try because it might be work for u  just like the Kinks and Aerosmith saw that the music develop by African Americans be more fun and expressive than their own and give it a try  It \u2019 s get more evidence of success than Janet Mock \u2019 s magic circle of fiat womanhood  I think DJ Mister Cee and his bos Ebro Darden have show enormous courage and humanity  and I think people will respond to that  I \u2019 m look forward to the first black \u201c Lola \u201d to top the chart  The guy who make that will be gold  After all  Steven Tyler and Dave Davies enjoy year of success after these song  and be regard today a elder statesman of rock  Tone L   333c  Well  what \u2019 s he do since 1991  ", "feedtitle": "Page 11 \u2013
