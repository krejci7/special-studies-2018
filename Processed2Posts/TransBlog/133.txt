\u2019 t like be negative  and I don \u2019 t like single out people  I \u2019 ve hold back for year  Unfortunately  people keep put in hour  month  year of work produce these bad statistic  and then advocate questionable policy base on them  This late one could be really damaging  It \u2019 s about trans regret  and it come from a British grad student name Maeve Regan  The recent Trans Mental Health Study be the large study of it kind ever undertake in Europe  with almost 900 respondent  The study ask specifically about individual \u2019 feeling of regret follow social andor medical transition  These be the result  In term of social change make during transition  come out to friend and family  change name  live full or part time in a gender not assign at birth   34  of respondent have minimal regret and 9  have significant regret  A small majority  53  have no regret  Specific regret give include  not have the body they have want from birth  not transition earlier  lose friend and family  and the impact of transition on others  In term of physical change make during transition  result from hormone therapy and surgical intervention   the vast majority  86   have no regret  Of the remainder  10  have minor regret and 2  have major regret  The specific regret give include complication relate to surgery  especially loss of sensitivity   and the choice of surgeon  if surgery result in complication or require revision and repair   Regan  who identify herself a \u201c cisgendered  not trans   \u201d write the above a part of a summary of finding of the Trans Mental Health Study  for which she be \u201c part of the Advisory Board \u201d  Edited to add   She conclude  \u201c It be clear from the actual report regret  along with the conclusion that transition be associate with a broad range of positive indicator  that most case of regret around transition be not relate to be a different gender to the one assign at birth  or undergoing transition  but rather due to poor surgical outcome  social stigma and huge barrier to medical care \u201d In other word  trans people never regret transition  We only regret the way we \u2019 re treat  or the way the surgery turn out  This statistic be use in an online discussion where I bring up trans regret   Edited   One of Regan \u2019 s coauthors  Jay McNeil  write  \u201c we find that where people do have regret  they be largely relate to their experience of how they be treat rather than the choice they \u2019 d make around their body  Where people felt like detransitioning it be mainly because they lack support to cope wit the social stigma and losses \u201d How be these percentage bad statistic  They be take from a nonrepresentative sample and generalize to all transgender people in the United Kingdom  Specifically  this survey be collect use the ubiquitous \u201c snowball \u201d method  Participants be encourage to take part mainly through a process of snowball  Trans support group  online forum and mail list with UK member be contact and give information about the study and ask to share the survey as widely a possible  Other equality and health group  and professional network with potential link to the trans population  eg  LGBT network  professional whose work might bring them into contact with trans people  be also contact and ask to distribute information about the survey  The survey spread primarily through wordofmouth  and the researcher attend a number of trans group in person to discuss the project and encourage participation  The survey be open for approximately 3 month  midApril 2012 to midJuly 2012   during which time reminder be post online  and the survey continue to be publicise  The problem be that \u201c trans people \u201d be typically define by whether they intend to transition  Regretters by definition withdraw that intent to transition  and be thus consider by many to be \u201c not really trans \u201d Some regretters  like nontransitioners  accept that classification and affirm  \u201c I guess I wasn \u2019 t trans after all \u201d Others may still consider themselves trans  but not want to hang around with the happy transitioning crowd  Would you  Regretters who don \u2019 t believe they \u2019 re trans wouldn \u2019 t take a \u201c trans mental health survey \u201d Regretters who be alienate from \u201c the trans community \u201d might not know about such a survey  and might not want to fill one out if they do know about it  So this survey be highly unlikely to have receive response from any serious regretters  That \u2019 s not evidence that regretters don \u2019 t exist  it \u2019 s evidence of bad sampling  These number could be really damaging because they give a false impression that regret doesn \u2019 t exist  That could set up any number of trans people for serious disappointment down the road  Of course  with this \u201c no true Scotsman \u201d  ahem  reasoning  the author may never find out  As I say  this snowball method be all over the place  I don \u2019 t want to single out the author of this study for do what practically every other trans researcher be do  I felt bad for focus on Emilia Dunham for publish a bunch of unfounded generalization back in 2011  But you need to start somewhere  And the conclusion that Regan draw be bad  bad  bad  I get the feeling that Regan and the other author of the Trans Mental Health study be kind  care people  and want to help all trans people  I think if they look into the eye of a regretter and saw the disappointment and frustration that I \u2019 ve see  they would care about them too  and stop this denial  I wonder if they will ever allow themselves to do it  ", "feedtitle": "Page 14 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
