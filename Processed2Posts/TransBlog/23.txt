to be comfortable with my transgender feeling  I have come out to my dad  and he have accept them and agree to let me live with him while I find work and save up some money  I have also get over my adolescent homophobia and come to admire lesbian  gay men and bisexual people who be out and proud  I have hear about the New York Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center  and that they have a Gender Identity Project  I go to the Center one day and be direct upstairs to the GIP office  where I be greet by a woman  She didn \u2019 t introduce herself  but I later recognize her in photo a the found Director of the GIP  Rosalyne Blumenstein  \u201c Can I help you  \u201d she ask  \u201c Well  uh  I \u2019 m transgender  and I want to know if you have any service for people who aren \u2019 t transitioning \u201d \u201c We don \u2019 t really have anything for crossdresser  but there \u2019 s an organization uptown call CDI  Crossdressers International  They might be able to help you  Here \u2019 s their number \u201d \u201c You don \u2019 t have anything for people who aren \u2019 t transition  \u201d \u201c No  sorry \u201d \u201c Uh  okay  thanks anyway \u201d I didn \u2019 t go to CDI  I muddle through with the support of friend and therapist who didn \u2019 t really know about transgender issue  I leave the city for grad school in 1997  and come back in 2000  I be live in a rough part of the South Bronx  I have a simple need that I think the Center might be able to help with  especially since they have become the Lesbian  Gay  Bisexual and Transgender Community Services Center  2  I go back to the Center and tell the receptionist I be transgender  and ask if they have a safe place where I could change my clothes  She say  \u201c No  we don \u2019 t really let anyone change in the bathroom because they make a mess \u201d I thank her and leave  and be halfway down the stair to the subway when I decide that wasn \u2019 t right at all  I go back upstairs and tell the receptionist I be very upset with what she say and I want to talk to someone about it  She tell me to wait  and after a few minute a woman come out and lead me back to a small room in the GIP office  I explain the situation to her a she listen sympathetically  and then she tell me that she didn \u2019 t have the power to change that policy because she be a counselor  but she would pass on my concern to management  And no  there be still no other service available at the GIP for people who weren \u2019 t transition  3  I eventually do go to CDI  and they be very nice and they do help me  but they be also very closeted and didn \u2019 t have much to offer someone like me who be largely out of the closet  They offer a safe place to change clothes  but their rate be way beyond my budget  4  For a while I go to the transgender support group at Queens Pride House  but at one meeting another support group member tell me I wasn \u2019 t really transgender because I wasn \u2019 t transitioning  The group moderator back me up  but I felt stress out rather than support  so I stop go  5  In 2003 I make contact with Helen Boyd  who convince Carrie Davis to get the Center \u2019 s policy change to allow people to change clothes in the bathroom  Helen also offer some support group at the Center for trans people and their partner for a while  Helen and her nowwife Betty run a message board that I find welcome and supportive for a few year  but it begin to attract increase number of transition trans people who be not content to simply discuss their personal reason for transitioning  but to insist that it be their destiny \u2013 and the destiny of every true trans person \u2013 to transition  This imply that people like me who don \u2019 t transition be either not truly trans or not transition  When I object to this  Helen and Betty refuse to back me up  and tell me to stop challenge the destiny talk because it be make other people uncomfortable  When I continue  they ban me from the message board  6  A few year ago I start go back to the Queens Pride House group  which have be more supportive  At the last meeting  there be a new member who insist that I \u201c hadn \u2019 t really decide \u201d who I be or what I want  Several of the other group member  include Pauline Park  the moderator and a founder of Queens Pride House  challenge this new member on her behavior  but it be still stressful and not supportive to be attack this way  And now  a I promise you  here be the point of this catalog of woe  To live a a trans person without transition be to be tell constantly that you don \u2019 t belong  that either you \u2019 re not really trans or that you \u2019 re deny your true nature  If you object you \u2019 re ignore for as long a possible  and then call divisive and disruptive  Some trans people may say that they get that too  but at least they get a few safe space  Most service for trans people be entirely orient towards transition  with a few exception that be orient towards the closet  And the point of that be that when people like Julia Serano claim that people who don \u2019 t transition or who detransition be a tiny minority  and that many of u don \u2019 t even identify a trans  it may not have anything to do with what trans people a a whole really believe or want  It may simply be that there be tremendous pressure to not be a trans person who doesn \u2019 t transition  and that we \u2019 re be pressure out of sight  and even out of existence  Serano have be around long enough that she ought to know this  but acknowledge it might give ammunition to people who say kid shouldn \u2019 t be allow to transition as soon a they say they want to  so she just sweep it under the rug  Thanks  ",
