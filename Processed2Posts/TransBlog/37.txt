slide down it if you don \u2019 t want to  I have already write the entire article in long form  if you want to read the whole thing right away  There \u2019 s an old and tasteless joke  Q  What \u2019 s the difference between a transvestite and a transsexual  A  Two year  Nowadays we would say \u201c cross dresser \u201d instead of \u201c transvestite \u201d and \u201c trans woman \u201d instead of \u201c transsexual  \u201d although that be problematic because transvestite and cross dresser be trans woman too  Behind this joke lie a common observation  that many people identify at one point in their life a crossdresser  butch lesbian or genderqueer  and then later transition to a binary gender different from the one assign to them at birth  The \u201c two year \u201d part come from the fact that this transition typically happen within two year of the time the observer first meet the trans person  or learns about their trans feeling  belief or action  Helen Boyd  in My Husband Betty  call it \u201c the slippery slope  \u201d and describe the anxiety that she and other people felt about their nontransitioning trans spouse  They didn \u2019 t want their partner to hide in fear  but they also be afraid of lose their partner  or no long find them attractive  Since read about the \u201c slippery slope  \u201d I \u2019 ve watch a good dozen or more people who have insist they be \u201c just cross dresser \u201d slide down to hormone and fulltime name and pronoun change   That include Betty  although she and Helen be able to work out a satisfactory arrangement to continue their marriage   I \u2019 ve read about many more  include celebrity like Lana Wachowski and Caitlyn Jenner  For the rest of this post I \u2019 m go to focus on the \u201c feminine spectrum \u201d of people assign male at birth who feel a desire to be woman  because that \u2019 s what I have the most information about  The dynamic be somewhat different for the masculine spectrum  but I believe a close look would find similar factor at work  A lot of people who have be down the slippery slope say thing like  \u201c I always know deep inside  \u201d or \u201c I have to stop hide my true self  \u201d but previously insist just a heavily that they know deep inside that their true self be male and that they want to live a men for the rest of their life  Others who now claim certainty use to say that they do not know  I don \u2019 t believe in essential gender  so I don \u2019 t buy the claim of essential womanhood make by people at the bottom of the slope or the claim of essential manhood make by those at the top of the slope  But I do believe that people at the bottom of the slope feel more like woman than those at the top  This be not because they have tap into some essence that be already there  but because they have build a feminine identity over the course of that two year or so  often without mean to or without understand the consequence  The consequence be important  because many people at the top of the slope believe that they be essentially different from the transitioners at the bottom  They believe they will never transition  they tell everyone that  and they plan their life around never transition  If they slip down the slope and transition  the consequence for their life and family be often dramatic  Other people at the top of the slope do not know whether they be trans  or whether transition be right for them  They want to find out and  often with the encouragement of other trans people  experiment with different form of feminine presentation  But many of them don \u2019 t realize that experimentation change you  If they slip down the slope  the result of the experiment will tell them to transition  It \u2019 s like put a big thumb on the scale  As the \u201c two year \u201d joke and Helen \u2019 s chapter indicate  a lot of people know that the slippery slope exist  There be three common response  and one be to reject everything trans and repress all transgender desire  This sometimes \u201c succeed \u201d in avoid transition  but repression always make the person miserable and resentful  In fact  repression can backfire  lead to resentment  rebellion and increase dysphoria  Another common response be to accept the slippery slope a inevitable  a Natalie Reed do when she tell me that gender dysphoria \u201c WILL keep come back  And it WILL get harder \u201d If it truly be inevitable  it be important to be honest with our loved one and begin plan the transition as soon a possible  When I hear about the slippery slope I wasn \u2019 t ready to accept transition a inevitable  I decide to see what I could do to avoid it  I \u2019 ve do more than that  though  I \u2019 ve kept my eye and ear open  I \u2019 ve pay attention to my own experience and learn from my mistake  And like a good video game player  I \u2019 ve watch others and learn from their success and failure  On the basis of all these observation  I think I understand how the slippery slope work  and I have come up with a set of strategy that I use to keep myself from slide down  I have be successful  I have avoid both repression and transition  and my peak dysphoria be not much high than it be when I come out twenty year ago  These strategy be highly experimental  I don \u2019 t know anyone else who have try them  so I can \u2019 t promise they will work for anyone else  But I hope some people will find them useful  If you try them  please let me know your success and failure  I want to stress one thing  this be not a prescription for every trans woman  I have no desire to secondguess anyone \u2019 s decision to transition  or to discourage anyone from give transition full consideration  On the contrary  I think all trans people should give transition full and careful consideration  I offer my observation in the hope that other people may find them useful in make their decision  These strategy be not easy  But then  repression be not easy  and transition be not easy  Ultimately  we should decide which of the three possibility to follow base on which one fit best with our vision of our own future  And until we decide  we should experiment and investigate in way that don \u2019 t predetermine our decision  This conclude the first installment of the Slippery Slope  You can read the next installment
