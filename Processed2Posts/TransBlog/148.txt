mention before  that the use of nonrepresentative sample can cause problem down the line  To illustrate this  I want to examine the claim of health disparity that Emilia Dunham list in her Bay Windows article  Transgender people take more hormone and have have more surgery than average  Transgender people smoke at a 30  prevalence rate  and use other substance to cope with the stress from discrimination  We \u2019 re more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety  and more likely to live with HIV  61 \u2013 64  of transgender people have be physically or sexually assault  41  of transgender people have attempt suicide  All these percentage skyrocket for transgender people of color and lowincome folk  A startle 1 in 5 transgender people have experience complete refusal of service from healthcare provider  If transgender people aren \u2019 t refer to with correct name or pronoun or be treat with coldness  they may avoid the office  Of these statement  only the last one be an existential statement  All the others be statement of prevalence or likelihood that be not generalizable without a representative sample  In my impression  some of them be more likely to be true of the entire transgender population than others  There be chain of causation from transgender action to these disparity  and the chain be not all the same  Here be some possible causal chain  They be not the only possible one  but they be the one that seem likely to me  First there be the inherent consequence of transgender action  more hormone and surgery  If you \u2019 re only concern with transpeople who choose to take hormone and undergo surgery  then of course this be true  But if you believe that not all transpeople choose hormone or surgery  and you don \u2019 t know how many do  then you have no way of know how great these disparity be  Then there be harassment base on perceptible difference  physical and sexual assault  A lot of this have to do with pass \u2013 a one gender or another  not necessarily the one you prefer  The passing do not have to be total  a transperson can avoid a lot of harassment simply by avoid be notice  However  note that there be a feedback loop here regard socioeconomic status  wealthy transpeople can afford high quality hormone  surgery  hair removal or attachment  clothes  padding  cosmetic and training that can give them  u  a good chance of pass a the target gender  There be also discrimination base on record or perceptible difference  refusal of healthcare service  There can also be housing  consumer and job discrimination  which can affect some of the factor below  A transgender person have a number of potential reaction to the harassment or discrimination describe above  include  avoidance of healthcare provider  depression  anxiety  substance abuse  suicide attempt  Out of fear of discovery  many transpeople engage in hidden sexual activity  where there be a great risk of HIV infection  Completing the vicious cycle I describe above be the consequence of poverty  which may in turn result from discrimination  there be great likelihood of harassment and discrimination  and the consequence that follow from that harassment and discrimination  and sex work  which increase the likelihood of HIV infection   I know from personal experience  from friend \u2019 anecdote and from online reading that these disparity do not affect all transgender people  Some people do not choose hormone  some do not choose surgery  Some never take publicly visible transgender action  and others pass well enough  so they be never harass or discriminate against  Some be able to deal with the harassment or discrimination they experience without resort to depression  anxiety or substance abuse  or attempt suicide  which be not a judgment against those who be unable   Some be able to avoid unprotected sex  Some be wealthy enough to avoid the consequence of poverty  Here \u2019 s the problem with sampling  Dunham and other researcher have no way of know for sure whether they \u2019 ve oversampled from those who choose hormone andor surgery  those who take publicly visible transgender action  those who don \u2019 t pas enough of the time to avoid harassment or discrimination  those who already have tendency towards depression  anxiety  substance abuse  suicide or casual sex  for unrelated reason  and those who have low income  After all  these be precisely the population that public health researcher be more likely to come into contact with  Without representative sample  they can never prove that these disparity exist to the extent that they claim  Now I want you to imagine that these researcher actually have be oversampling these higherrisk population  On one level the consequence be minimal  if these be the population with the great need  then it \u2019 s just another way to spend public health dollar on the people who need them the most  But on the image level and the credibility level  there be problem  I \u2019 ve see on the Web and on television that some people have a stereotype of \u201c tranny \u201d that combine all these factor  a drugaddicted  unpassable  mentally ill hooker with bad plastic surgery  Some people use that stereotype to justify harassment and discrimination against transgender people  and some family member fight against accept their relative \u2019 s transgender feeling because they fear that this will be their fate  These kind of unsupported survey result fee into those stereotype  What if at some point someone do succeed in do a representative survey  and find that the drugaddicted  cigarettesmoking sex worker be a small portion of the transgender population  and that the average transgender person be a drug and diseasefree  welladjusted  successful computer technician make  60000 a year  What if all the transgender health money be actually good spent on overlap program that would serve the needy population just as well  I think someone might feel cheat  and I think there might be a backlash  There \u2019 s also the possibility that we might be miss out on some valuable information  What if we find that there be people who have the exact same background  and the exact same transgender feeling  but one group become drugaddicted HIVpositive hooker and the other become successful computer technician  We could examine the population and see what make the difference between health and sickness  It might not be the obvious solution  This be why we need representative sampling  and this be why you need to comment on the proposal and tell that to Secretary Sebelius  ", "feedtitle": "Page 15 \u2013 Trans Blog"}
