right of trans people in prison and detention facilities\u2013has be in the news lately  It should be a chance to raise awareness around this important issue and to use medium to push forward the tide of increase respect for prisoner \u2019 fundamental right that be evidence in several recent event  include successful lawsuit in Wisconsin and Massachusetts around transitionrelated care in prison and the issuance of a final ruling on the Prison Rape Elimination Act that incorporate many of trans advocate \u2019 recommendation regard trans prisoner  But it be evident from the start that this would be a tricky story to bend in the direction of education and advocacy on the issue  because this be a story that most people just can \u2019 t pull past Us v  Them  The headline that start roll in last week range from moreorless balance to fearmongering on the conservative opinion side  Judge rule in favor for inmate \u2019 s sex change operation  Boston Globe  Sep 4  Judge order Mass  to pay for inmate \u2019 s sex change surgery  Boston Globe  Sep 5  Ruling on prisoner \u2019 s sexchange a matter of principle  Boston Globe  Sep 6  Judge go too far in sex change ruling  Boston Globe  Sep 7  Is deny treatment to transsexual inmate \u201c cruel and unusual  \u201d  The Atlantic  Sep 7  Free sex change for prisoner be distasteful  but justify  Boston Globe  Sep 10  The real war on women\u2013rewarded for kill his wife  BernardGoldbergcom  Sep 10  Inmate \u2019 s sex change  humane or insane   Santa Maria Times  Sep 11  The fact of the case make it tempt  even for transgender people and those engage in trans right work  to focus on the individual involve and how heinous it seem that the state would give someone convict of kill her wife a \u201c free sex change \u201d It \u2019 s entirely understandable that those who can \u2019 t access necessary transitionrelated health care due to the cost of that care and the lack of insurance coverage would find it frustrate when a prisoner be allow access to the same care on the state \u2019 s dime  But to focus on Kosilek \u2019 s crime  or on the idea of \u201c free benefit \u201d for prisoner  be entirely miss the point  Yes  it \u2019 s strange that someone in prison would have good access to healthcare than someone who hasn \u2019 t be convict of a crime  but the problem here isn \u2019 t that a prisoner do have access  it \u2019 s that many others don \u2019 t  Prisoners should have access to healthcare a a fundamental human right  and so should everyone else  True  many people don \u2019 t have that access right now  but access to human right isn \u2019 t about rank people by how much we think they deserve a right and doling it out accordingly  Healthcare access in this country depend on a lot of things\u2013structural inequality  economic opportunity  whether you can get insurance coverage  and whether your insurance cover the treatment you need  to name a few  The Kosilek case be about a specific legal determination under one specific standard that give prisoner in a particular jurisdiction access to health care  The judge make the right call in this case  There be many other case  many other standard  that impact trans people \u2019 s right to transitionrelated care in different situation  and many people don \u2019 t have care yet  That suck  but it doesn \u2019 t mean we should wait until all those case be solve before we provide healthcare to trans prisoner  It mean that we need to hold our country to a standard of basic human right in all area  I also want to remind folk in general  but particularly some of the commenters on Lesley \u2019 s xoJane piece who be heavily focus on the idea of \u201c free surgery \u201d or \u201c reward prisoner  \u201d that it \u2019 s the prison system itself that lead to this situation  When people commit crime in the United States  we handle it through incarceration  We incarcerate people in facility where if they be allow to work  they can \u2019 t make very much money and they certainly can \u2019 t afford to pay for their own healthcare  One of the consequence of that system be an enormous burden on the state  but that have nothing to do with the question of what necessary healthcare be  There be other solution to criminality  solution that expert on prison abolition and reform can speak to far good than me  If we provide some mean for criminal to work and pay to access right such a healthcare  then the argument might fly  But we don \u2019 t  and so it \u2019 s the state \u2019 s responsibility to pay for care  The state be fail in other areas\u2013we don \u2019 t provide adequate health care for the young  the old  the sick  noncitizens  or those with disabilities\u2013but again  the answer to failure in one area be not to fail in another  If this case piss you off  if you \u2019 re outrage  then great  Excellent  Join the fight for right to transitionrelated care through Medicaid  Medicare  the VA  private insurance  and other program  Fight for expansion of the Affordable Care Act  But don \u2019 t spend your time argue about this one trans woman who do a terrible thing and later win a petition for her human right  Frankly  it \u2019 s a waste  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
