\u2019 s easy to feel erased when everything you read group behavior of men vs behavior of woman  and you don \u2019 t fit into either of those category  But be there a reason to organize the world in this way  Do gender difference exist  In this post  I \u2019 ll address the the theoretical question of whether gender difference exist  and then  in a second post  I \u2019 ll ask the policy question of whether there \u2019 s any utility to use gender difference on a practical level  So  be there gender difference  Well  yes  simply put  They aren \u2019 t black and white  and of course we can \u2019 t say that all men do x and all woman do y about anything whatsoever  But there be observable trend  which be unsurprising give our tendency a a society to group absolutely everything by gender  These trend be both inform by  and perpetuate  our tendency to use gender a the primary category when we organize our world  They erase those of u who be in between male and female  or outside of that system  because there be a tendency to try to push anyone who doesn \u2019 t fit into the box with everyone else  There be a recent post on Genderfork by someone who note that zie be happy not pass  and I can relate to that  because there be so much pressure to \u201c pas \u201d a one gender or another  to climb into either box  Genderqueer people be still  for the most part  raise a one gender or another  We be also perceive  for the most part  a one gender at a time  Most people be not comfortable see someone a not gendered  or bigendered  or a a third gender  and so society encourage u to secondguess our own identity a fall outside of the gender system  As a genderqueer person raise female  I often have an internal struggle with thing I enjoy  do  or wear that be categorize by others a \u201c female \u201d I sometimes feel guilty when I do something that feel gendered\u2013for example  when I wear a dress\u2013but I have to remind myself that how I organize the world be a choice  I can consciously reject gender  and resist be label \u201c female \u201d What I have to do be reject my brain \u2019 s tendency towards confirmation bias\u2013that little societal trigger that see a female behavior and try to offer this a evidence that I be really female  that my alternate way of see the world be a sham  This builtin mechanism perpetuates gender category  but categorization be always a choice  So back to the original question\u2013do gender difference exist  Here \u2019 s how I see it  If most \u201c woman \u201d see themselves in most of the trait that we label \u201c female  \u201d then a gender category emerge  The member of the category\u2013women\u2013don \u2019 t have to recognize themselves in every trait  or even a vast majority  There might even be some female trait that no woman  or very few woman  relate to  but as long a there \u2019 s a big bunch of trait that many woman identify with  the category stay alive  If Woman A identifies with X and Y  and Woman B identifies with Y and Z  and Woman C identifies with X and Z  then we could probably come up with a category \u201c woman \u201d that consists of X  Y  Z  and Q  and Women A  B  and C would likely go with that  Those minority traits sneak in there because woman  or men\u2013the same be true for both gender category  be encourage to be silent about the trait that don \u2019 t match them  There be pressure to be gendered  and so it \u2019 s understood that there be \u201c female \u201d trait that not all woman share  Another tendency be for subgroup like \u201c tomboy \u201d to form  so that those who relate to fewer trait still identify a female gendered  and don \u2019 t rock the boat too much  Finally  some woman may try to conform to trait they don \u2019 t share  to feel more comfortable in their gender  with their peer  or for whatever other reason  Also  all trait be not create equal  Some trait have huge weight  make it hard for someone label \u201c female \u201d to consider alternative  For example  a person who have breast  hip  and a vulva  who menstruate and produce \u201c female \u201d hormone  be likely to consider these trait of far great importance in determine gender than personality trait  Hence \u201c woman can do anything  \u201d \u201c woman can be aggressive  \u201d etc  rather than \u201c woman can do everything men can do  but also there be other option outside of male and female \u201d Personally  I have quite a vast majority of \u201c female \u201d trait  I have never identify with a transmasculine perspective  which be probably why it take me a while to identify a genderqueer and while I still don \u2019 t identify with a genderqueer community  All thing equal  I prefer \u201c female \u201d color  fashion  and hobby  I \u2019 m shy and prefer to be the \u201c passive \u201d one in relationship  I love bake  When I get emotional  I cry and be sad  and I almost never experience anger  Initially  I try be more masculine to signal or bolster my gender difference  because it be so much easy to signal difference with clear cue  It \u2019 s much easy to \u201c look masculine \u201d than to look agendered  When I read these article compare men and woman  never mention alternative or alternative way of group human being  I sometimes question the validity of my identity because I do see myself in a lot of the \u201c female \u201d trait mention  Beyond feeling erase because my chosen identity be never mention  be genderqueer take away any authority I have to speak a someone who have the specific trait mention  I don \u2019 t get to have an opinion because the article be about men and woman  and I be neither  Like relationship article with the \u201c heterosexual only \u201d disclaimer at the beginning  anything that contrast two gender take away my authority to speak on the subject  even if I see myself in the article in some other way  In part two  I \u2019 ll ask whether the men vs woman distinction have any utility from a policy perspective  Please stay tune  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 3 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
