binary", "policy"], "text": "In my last post  I ask the theoretical question  do gender difference exist  I conclude that there be observable trend that group people moreorless by gender  but that identify with a particular gender doesn \u2019 t mean that one identifies with every trait society assign to that gender  and that gender categorization can be damage both to those who do and do not identify a male or female  Next  I \u2019 d like to consider the policy implication of the question  The challenge here be to question whether gender difference have any utility from a policy perspective  while still respect the lived experience and claim identity of those who identify a male or female  I can say that gender difference be illusory  that the \u201c box \u201d create by a lump of trait be in many way artificial  and that the weight put on certain trait such a secondary sex characteristic and hormone obscure the actual diversity that exist in our society  But while say this  I have to recognize that the category \u201c male \u201d and \u201c female \u201d do mean something for many people  perhaps most  and that these category can be useful when setting policy  organize  or do activist work  So \u201c male \u201d and \u201c female \u201d can be helpful category for practical purpose  but I would like to argue that an exclusively gendered perspective be bad policy  I think that in almost  if not all case  we can look at a problem or a potential structure a activist  organizer  writer  or policymakers and use a more nuanced strategy to plan an approach  It \u2019 s important to take a challenge on it face and determine what the best way to define a population be for that give challenge  rather than pick gender a a default  Then  if gender be relevant  it \u2019 s important to look at other factor  to determine whether the population be broad or narrow than \u201c male \u201d or \u201c female  \u201d and whether other type of grouping within those population might have different need  An exclusively gendered perspective tends to do two thing  one  it leave member of the relevant population out  and two  it erase subgroup within a population  The first point can be illustrate fairly easily with some example  The definition of \u201c woman \u201d be constantly come up whenever a feminist group decide to hold a womenonly event  or create a womenonly space  or provide a service for woman  Often  trans woman be exclude in these case  when trans woman be frequently the member of the relevant population most in need of service  If feminist organizer be to use the thing they be plan  say  a safe space for woman  a a starting point  they would inevitably see that trans woman  and often  trans people generally  have an obvious need for that thing  Using a safe space a an example  the point be to create a space free of harassment  gendered insult  rape  sexism  etc  It \u2019 s hard to see how trans people aren \u2019 t in need of this kind of space  Another obvious example be health care  Health care need be difficult to segregate base on gender  because health care need depend on a huge number of factor  include one \u2019 s physical body  hormone  lifestyle  genetics  etc  When a health care service such a OBGYN care  pregnancy prevention counseling  or abortion be frame a a service \u201c for woman  \u201d those who don \u2019 t identify a woman be exclude from service they need  The doctor \u2019 s office be a scary space for many trans  genderqueer  intersex  and otherwise gendernonconforming people because there be no guarantee that the health care provider will respect an individual \u2019 s gender  understand it  or provide appropriate service  If campaign intend to address health risk and need service use more genderneutral language  even directly target trans  genderqueer  and intersex folk  they would likely be more successful in reach the entire intended population  Health be also a good example of the second problem  that of erase subgroup within the population in favor of the majority \u2019 s  or most visible group \u2019 s  need  Gender and health don \u2019 t just come up in the context of reproductive health service  Almost every time I read an article at work about public health  risk of disease  or prevention strategy  it be frame by gender  These article almost always mention the relative risk for male and female  state that the risk be the same  or point out flaw in study that don \u2019 t include enough men or enough woman  Because gender be use a a shorthand  I have no idea whether the reason for a differential risk be hormone  genetics  physical structure  brain chemistry  or something else  and thus I can \u2019 t evaluate my own risk because I don \u2019 t have a \u201c normal \u201d grouping of all these thing to create the \u201c female \u201d shorthand  But this isn \u2019 t the only problem with the shorthand  Medical and public health study very frequently have a race problem  In all but the large study  you \u2019 ll see a mention that not enough respondent for at least one racial group be available  There be also invisible minority that aren \u2019 t mentioned\u2013people with disability  people with less access to healthcare  nonEnglish speaker  indigenous people  etc  etc  People with common comorbities be sometimes exclude from clinical trial  as well  A particular subgroup might be mention  but in almost every study I read  some important group be leave out  When the study population be casually group a \u201c woman \u201d or \u201c men  \u201d someone may read the study and assume that the result apply\u2013when in fact  for example  a black work class woman \u2019 s likelihood of contract an illness might be much close to a black working class man \u2019 s likelihood than to that of a white middle class woman  While it be obvious that resource be scarce  and no writer or activist or organizer can account for every single possible subgroup  it be important to consider one \u2019 s limitation and make a note of them  It \u2019 s also smart policy to consider the topic at hand  and then choose an appropriate way to categorize population  If subgroup might have different need  it \u2019 s easy to at the very least point that out and suggest that others focus on those need  If a gender group be be use for a particular reason  such a biology  mental health  emotional need  physical strength  brain chemistry  or anything else  it \u2019 s good to point that out directly than to use gender a a shorthand  Thanks for reading  If anyone have thought on these question or suggestion on how to implement good policy  I \u2019 d welcome a discussion in comment or on Twitter  You can find me  queerscholar  ",
