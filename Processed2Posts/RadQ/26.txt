frustrate by the grow focus in recent month on two of the thing I care least about when it come to queer right  the two thing that the mainstream LGBT movement seem most adamant about  marriage and the military  It \u2019 s impossible to get away from those two topic if you \u2019 re follow LGBT news  but this book also turn my focus to another problem\u2013that the mostcovered \u201c alternative \u201d issue  those focus on individual right  be still not the most important priority  Employment and housing discrimination be important but they focus on the middle class  Hate crime be a problem  but the kneejerk response of hate crime legislationtries to solve that problem by use the same harmful official system that terrorize queer and trans people on a daily basis  I would recommend this book to any activist  but especially to white  middleclass activist in the \u201c LGBT movement \u201d The piece in this anthology encourage u to get away from the white  middleclass idea of \u201c safety \u201d Strong sentence for hate crime don \u2019 t make u safe  Nor do most of the priority of LGBT right organization  It be only from a privileged position that we can even believe that there might be a safe  mainstream  assimilate place to work and live  Conservatives and moderate in the movement  and outside of it  want you to feel safe  It \u2019 s another story of u versus them  it help those who be disgust by trans people of color  by poor queer youth  by public queer sexuality  to tug the most powerful and heavily fund segment of the LGBT population away into a zone of \u201c safety \u201d and assimilation  Of course  many queer and trans people don \u2019 t have that luxury  and it \u2019 s foolish to think that any of u really do  Queer and trans people in prison  juvenile in the child \u201c welfare \u201d system  immigrant  sex worker  the homeless  and other marginalize group be often victim of a cruel and unusual system that target minority and encourage oppression  The word \u201c cruel and unusual \u201d bring me to the second reason why this review be so timely  Today  the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals affirm a district court in find that a law deny trans prisoner hormone treatment or sex reassignment surgery constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution  This be an exciting victory  but it \u2019 s also not enough  Cruel and unusual punishment go beyond the specific case of deny medical treatment to prisoner with \u201c severe \u201d case of Gender Identity Disorder  a term that  thankfully  be up for a change in the DSMV   The way the entire medical  legal  and government establishment medicalize  criminalize  and problematize queer and trans body be cruel and unusual  This case be an important step a evidence by the horrific story in Captive Genders about trans people be deny hormone  surgery  and even HIVAIDS treatment  but the opinion still problematizes trans body  The medical model say that to qualify for surgery  one must demonstrate gender in a certain way  There be little room for creativity or subjective experience  A trans body under this model be something to feel pity over  the familiar narrative of be \u201c trapped \u201d Examples of problematizing queer and trans body abound in the anthology  In family law  Wesley Ware describe how the child \u2019 s \u201c best interest \u201d turn into protection from gender variance and child in the system be subject to \u201c sexualidentity confusion counseling  \u201d where queerness be see a a \u201c symptom \u201d and queer and trans identity be \u201c pathologized \u201d This be particularly true for queer and trans youth of color  who be  in Audre Lorde \u2019 s word  \u201c never mean to survive \u201d In prison  Michelle C Potts describe the use of blood a an excuse to segregate HIVpositive prisoner  with measure as extreme a not allow openly gay prisoner  regardless of health status  to serve food  Lori A Saffin describe these insidious sort of homophobia and transphobia a a form of spirit murder  which I find particularly apt  One of my law school professor  Adrien Wing  teach the concept of spirit murder a a slow buildup of collective psychological and emotional pain over time  Spirit murder and spirit injury come up in the context of violence in or towards a community\u2013for example  the overall effect of rape on black woman  They be so destructive because they prey not only on an individual but on an identity and even an entire culture  An individual doesn \u2019 t have to experience direct harm to be a victim of spirit murder  The collective harm of many  many physical assault or assault on identity instead contribute to the slow murder of a community \u2019 s collective soul  This concept be easy to apply to queer and trans people  a over time many of u come to accept state harm and the idea that our body and identity be criminal  sick  or simply wrong  This problematizing of queer and trans body be severe and allencompassing  Furthermore  the mainstream LGBT movement contribute to this problem by fail to recognize the structural nature of homophobictransphobic oppression  We need to grind queer activism in the experience of those most marginalized  a Jennifer Worley describe in the example of the Vanguard in 1970s San Francisco  When we look at queertrans issue a a class problem  we see how those at the bottom of the ladder be ignore  erase  or attack while higherup  mostly  gay and lesbian who assimilate be accept in the mainstream culture  Erica R Meiners use James Baldwin \u2019 s word to describe this assimilation at the expense of others a \u201c the price of the ticket \u201d Those who want the benefit of mainstream culture have to accept it priority  and often don \u2019 t notice the harm go on within the broad queertrans community  \u201c Over the year  \u201d Yasmin Nair explain  \u201c especially begin in the mid1990s  the \u2018 gay right movement \u2019 have become a perfect replica of the neoliberal state \u201d This trend be easy to see  a mainstream medium image focus on how gay and lesbian be \u201c just like you  \u201d and those who don \u2019 t look \u201c just like \u201d those in charge be demonized\u2013people of color  \u201c promiscuous \u201d bisexual  genderdeviant trans and genderqueer people  immigrant  indigenous queer  people with disability  childfree and polyamorous individual  etc  Rather than focus on how the prisonindustrial complex harm pretty much everyone  it \u2019 s easy for some to imagine the PIC a do it job of keep the \u201c undesirable \u201d element out and protect  rather than attack  queer community  The good news be that there be some solution  Captive Genders argue for abolition through a number of piece  some author by those who have be in prison themselves  Other strategy include penpal program to offer support to queer and trans prisoner and coalitionbuilding with antiracism and general antiprison group  Reading about the way Canadian queer in the 1980s appropriate sexual space like the bathhouse to create a social space or a queer home  I begin to think about how we might offer support through online forum  We can also change the conversation through our blogging  writing  and community activism  When we talk about \u201c queer issue  \u201d we can include prison abolition  racial justice  and other issue that have not typically be consider queer  A personal  collective response seem to be the most apt way to address such an individualist  capitalist  impersonal problem  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 3 \u2013 Radically Queer"}
