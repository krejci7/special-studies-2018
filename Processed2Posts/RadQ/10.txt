the Capitol and I be strike by the shirt we be all wearing that say \u201c LGBT Families for Immigration Reform \u201d I felt like a bit of a jerk for criticize the shirt later to a friend  but it just keep niggle at me  Why LGBT family  Why not LGBT people  My question get to a big problem that come up a lot in LGBT organize work when we want to develop message around \u201c X Is a Trans Issue \u201d or \u201c X Is an LGBT Issue \u201d The challenge  generally  be to convince an audience of LGBT folk  or in my case  often trans folk  that some policy area that \u2019 s not usually associate with the core goal of the movement be at it heart an LGBT or trans issue  We usually do that in one of two way  Link the issue to core LGBT movement issue  This be what the tshirt example do  We tend to think of family issue a a movement priority  whether that \u2019 s marriage or secondparent adoption or binational family immigration issue  A lot of LGBT immigration reform proponent have use the example of binational couple to make the argument  if we agree that queer family be a core issue for our movement  then we should be concern about the immigration law because they often separate family  Other example of this include link reproductive right to transitionrelated health care or frame health care a an LGBT issue via hospital visitation policy problem  Tell a tragic compelling story about a queer or trans person  Strategy B be what come up when you don \u2019 t have a good hook with an agreedupon issue  or sometimes alongside that hook  You find some really sad example of violenceabusediscrimination  preferably use people who be consider upstanding and acceptable accord to movement value  and you tell their story from a human right angle  \u201c This person be part of our community and the abuse heshethey suffer be so bad that it trigger a need to consider this an LGBTtrans issue from a human right perspective \u201d So for example  you might find a gay man and a trans woman who be rap in prison and use their tragic story to illustrate why prison reform be an LGBT issue  Neither of these way be wrong  exactly  It \u2019 s true that the agreedupon core issue often do touch others  like immigration  and it \u2019 s also true that compel story be a good way to remind people that we \u2019 re all human and we need to support human right  But I think we can do good  Why be immigration a trans issue  Yes  it \u2019 s about human right  and thus we should care from a solidarity or ally perspective if we \u2019 re nonimmigrant trans people  Yes  some trans people have experience really shitty thing at the hand of our immigration system  and we want that to stop  Yes  draconian immigration law separate queer family  include family with trans member  But it \u2019 s also a trans issue for reason that be less sexy and harder to describe  Trans immigrant have to deal with a lot of shit  not only when they experience the really amazingly awful  frontpageheadline story kind of treatment  They deal with daily microaggressions that be compound by dual identity  and often also by race  class  and ethnicity  Some of these trans immigrant be not ideal candidate for a Facebook post or a fundraising email  They may have a history of criminality or be too politically radical to use in a carefullyorchestrated communication strategy  They may not want to be part of such a strategy  And then  beyond the individual people who be both trans and immigrant  our immigration system a an institution overlap a lot with the problem trans people be fight  The problem with our immigration system and the violence and discrimination trans people face be clearly part of the same disgust web of policing  capitalism  xenophobia  patriarchy  and kyriarchy  There \u2019 s not much difference between the vigilante with gun who stand at the USMexico border and those who beat up or murder trans woman in the street  There \u2019 s not much difference between police harass immigrant with \u201c paper please \u201d policy and racial profiling and police harassing trans people with gender policing and ask for ID to use the restroom  I have a problem with the \u201c link to a core issue \u201d strategy because I want to know who come up with those core issue  It \u2019 s not even that it \u2019 s a singleissue marriage movement  it \u2019 s that it \u2019 s a movement of five or ten or fifteen core issue  We have hundred of issue  and how we prioritize them necessarily varies from person to person  Of course organization and individual have to prioritize their use of limited resource  and I support use strategy such a determine who be most marginalized within a community  determine what issue area be tackle the least and thus need more resource commitment  and determine what issue a group can tackle most efficiently with give resource  But it doesn \u2019 t take many resource to simply say \u201c we care about this \u201d I have a problem with the compel story strategy  and with the overall \u201c we care about this because we be all human \u201d strategy  because it both privilege the easiesttopackage story and can become weak and dilute  When we hear \u201c X be a human right  \u201d it may be absolutely true but we hear that so many thing be human right and it doesn \u2019 t necessarily speak to u  I think we need to acknowledge the specificity of our interest in different issue a queer and trans people  So again  immigration be a trans issue because we a trans people be deal with this tangled web of policing and patriarchy and bullshit  and part of address that system be support immigration reform  Immigration be a trans issue because trans immigrant experience multiple form of oppression that make them one of the part of our trans community most in need of social  legal  and policy change  I think that we have an enormous untapped creative potential a a movement  and that we need to start go allin  take risk  and support social justice in all it form not simply because we be human but because we be human who know the tremendous pain and suffer a broken system can cause  We need to acknowledge that this be what queer and trans work be about  whether we \u2019 re work for marriage equality or health care coverage or immigration or protection for sex worker  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Radically
