data", "trans tech"], "text": "As this post go live  I \u2019 ll be share a talk at AlterConf DC call \u201c 5 Simple Steps for TransInclusive Data \u201d This talk originally creep into my brain a an idea for a very long blog post  and a I be prepare to cut that idea down to twenty minute with Q  A time  I decide to also execute the original plan  since I can \u2019 t possibly say everything I want to about how to make data more transinclusive in fifteen minute  The post that follow be a detailed guide of specific step you can take to make whatever data you work with more transinclusive  build off of the talk content  Skim through the list below and use any tip that you find applicable  I \u2019 m drawing from my experience work with member and donor data at national nonprofit organization  but you can apply this advice to any kind of humancentered data you collect include data on customer  employee  patient  survey respondent  and app user  My start point here be that trans people can show up in any data set  and so it \u2019 s important to address the need we have around privacy  comfort  and affirmation not a a special population but a a regular part of data strategy  Rather than othering trans people  consider our experience an opportunity to improve your data collection  storage  and analysis practice for everyone  If you \u2019 d like to hear more after read the tip below  check out my speaking page for more information  I \u2019 m hop to do more \u201c dataqueer \u201d talk and workshop in the future  Balance need carefully when ask about gender There be no one right answer to make your data transinclusive  what data you can respectfully collect and how you ask for it depend on your purpose Ask  what be mythe organization \u2019 sthe company \u2019 s present and future need  In what context will you need someone \u2019 s name  pronoun  identity  gender marker  etc  for your current purpose or in the future  For example  if you need to book someone \u2019 s flight or submit a legal form on their behalf  you may need to ask for a name that would be irrelevant if all you need to know be what someone would like to be call Ask  why do I need this piece of data  for each piece you want to collect   Make sure the question you ask on your form or survey be both specific enough and general enough base on what you actually need to know Example  if you \u2019 re try to decide whether to ask if someone be \u201c LGBT \u201d versus transidentified  consider whether you offer any additional benefit or tailor program specific to trans folk  or whether potentially include trans folk separately in analysis could be beneficial and lead to more inclusion  rather than just want data for it own sake  Disclosure can be burdensome and risky  so do a costbenefit analysis and be sure that any information you collect be for a purpose Think ahead about potential change to data structure It \u2019 s always harder to migrate data to a smarter structure later than it be to take the time to think about it now  so keep your future need in mind If you ask a broad question and later want more specific data  you will have outlier that you may have to discard\u2013for example  if you ask about transgender identity broadly and later want to do genderspecific outreach But if you ask a very specific question that you win \u2019 t ever need  then later go broad  it \u2019 s dangerous to assume that each narrow category go neatly into the \u201c umbrella \u201d \u2014 for example  not all genderqueer people identify a transgender  and not all trans people want to be lump under the \u201c LGBT \u201d acronym Consider your audience in advance Does your data collection question make sense to your entire audience  Is your question culturally inclusive  example  masculineofcenter vs \u201c AFAB trans people \u201d  inclusion of indigenous and nonwhite term   Ask actual member of the community and do your research Consider offer alternative to mediate the tension between data that be possible to analyze effectively and allow folk to selfdefine For gender  you can offer malefemalesomething else but also offer a free text box for a more complete description If possible  let people identify with multiple community  for example  someone can be trans  female  queer  and intersex simultaneously  Develop an advanced plan for what to do if you receive external data that doesn \u2019 t conform to your structure Ask for gender  pronoun  and name contextually Many trans people answer these question differently depend on who \u2019 s asking and why they want to know \u2014 for example  name might vary for  Phone and mail correspondence vs online correspondence  particularly if you live with someone who isn \u2019 t aware of your trans status Official purpose such a file legal document  book a flight  charge a credit card  or issue a tax receipt  be as specific a possible about your purpose if you need this information and consider destroy later Public recognition such a a badge name or donor acknowledgement Asking for this information contextually doesn \u2019 t just benefit trans people \u2014 it work well for nickname  marry name  and those who use different name depend on cultural or social context Label field as clearly a possible and keep original context on the backend Give the user help text to understand what you \u2019 re ask and how you \u2019 ll use the data \u2014 and give them a chance to opt out If a backend field label doesn \u2019 t say everything about how the information be collect  add a description \u2014 it \u2019 s easy to get confuse later If you need a lot of alternative field  you may want to leave them all visible to everyone a a teaching moment  or consider a link like \u201c I go by different name in different situation \u201d that allow folk to expand their option on a form without stigmatize or othering Avoid valueladen and overly general language like \u201c real  \u201d \u201c birth  \u201d \u201c legal  \u201d or \u201c preferred \u201d \u2014 not only can it be offensive  but it \u2019 s also easy to forget how you \u2019 ve promise to use the data later and make it hard to clearly update Train staff and volunteer so they \u2019 re not surprised  for example  if someone have two \u201c differently gendered \u201d name or want to change their name or gender identity in your database This also help when you \u2019 re look for duplicate in your data  since many folk who work with data aren \u2019 t aware that two record with \u201c differently gendered \u201d first name could be duplicate  Avoid out and protect privacy Honestly evaluate the security of your system  technological and human  and be transparent with user about the degree of privacy they can expect Only take data that you actually need so user have a choice not to disclose sensitive information  optional field be your friend   If you \u2019 re go to publish demographic statistic  make sure those you \u2019 re collect data from be aware and can opt out Even if you have consent  be aware of sample size and find way to smooth data or let a respondent know if publish data that include gendertrans identity might make their response obvious  on satisfaction or HR survey with few trans respondent  for example  If you need information for a onetime purpose  such a name and gender marker for book a flight  offer to destroy that data after a certain period of time for everyone or those who request it\u2013and make sure you actually do destroy it Train staff and volunteer to be aware of privacy concern  even just share a list of legal name  for example  could be a huge violation of privacy Replace othering with universal design At an event  include pronoun on everyone \u2019 s name badge Avoid ask for gender or a title  MrMsMrs   if you don \u2019 t absolutely need it Make it very easy to update data such a name  username  or gender Whenever possible  allow selfupdating online Make it clear how to update data  rather than bury the instruction While they aren \u2019 t always  usernames can be gendered and thus as important to change a a first name If remove the old data from the system entirely will possibly cause problem in the future  such a not recognize a duplicate record with an old name and potentially use that name in the future  be transparent about your purpose for keep the data  offer option  and lock the old data down to a few people a possible Refuse to work with database or integrate platform vendor who win \u2019 t provide the custom field and update option you need If at all possible  don \u2019 t compromise on the data structure and plan you \u2019 ve develop because a vendor standardize field Instead  spend your money with more flexible vendor If you work with partner organization or company and share data  encourage them to adopt similar policy and practice around this data rather than design your system to incorporate their more standardize data set Have additional question  Want to share your own thought around make data practice more trans andor queer inclusive  Comment below  Tweet me
