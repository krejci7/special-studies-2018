my position now  While some radical feminist say that the word \u201c female \u201d only have meaning in the context of reproductive organ  which make me male  and that concept of feminine and masculine be define by patriarchy  and be unnatural and oppressive  I think most people see that the word feminine and masculine have meaning  and while there be a wide range of behaviour and overlap bell curve  woman tend to be more feminine than men  This apply even if what may be think of a feminine or masculine be a matter of culture  rather than innate  In that sense  I be feminine  People say that I be feminine  Around transition  they notice that I have to put on an act to present male  I have a sense of bury the Real Me very deeply  and when I have a sense of let myself out  my sense be that the Real Me be female  Or feminine  whatever  If the theory of autogynephilia be correct  then I be a man sexually arouse by the thought of myself a a woman  But that would make me masculine  So the theory can not be correct

The theory of autogynephilia make the theory of primary transsexualism  \u201c homosexual \u201d or androphile MF transsexuality  inconceivable  For the diagnostic criterion of primary transsexualism be gender dysphoria  Imagine that I be a man  fall down the slippery slope of perversion to live female full time  That would give me crush gender dysphoria  the sense that my physical body do not match my gender identity  But I do not  now  have gender dysphoria  I can see that the sexual drive may mask or overcome other feeling  but \u201c homosexual transsexual \u201d claim that gender dysphoria be overwhelming  and give that I be not sexually arouse all the time  I would have think that it would be strong enough to overcome my autogynephilia by now

When I be consider transition  terrify by the idea of autogynephilia and certain that if I be autogynephiliac transition would be wrong  I have a naive understanding of paraphilia  a \u201c blank slate \u201d view  This be that the paraphiliac be by default a normal heterosexual male  in whom the sexual drive accidentally get attach to something other than people of the opposite sex shoe  asphyxia  whatever and that in the case of the autogynephiliac it be attach to the thought of himself a a woman  With a little selfcontrol  he could have overcome these desire and be a normal heterosexual husband and father  But that do not fit the passionate  determine drive I and other lesbian trans woman I know have to make men of ourselves  Often we join hypermasculine profession  One be in the police tactical firearm unit  Some be in the armed force  One be in the secret service  and one in a criminal gang  Of course the sex drive be strong  but that drive seem strong to me  We seek to make men of ourselves to fit in  because we be inculcate with patriarchal idea of manhood  that be a sissy be the ultimate shame  Again  our transition to express ourselves female seem more of an identity issue than a perversion issue  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 I internalise a great deal of shame at be TS  and especially at the thought of be TS because of a perversion  I need to manage that shame  If the blank slate theory be correct  and I could have be a normal male if I have not masturbate to pervert fantasies other men manage it  why not me   a close analogy as far a concern guilt and shame be the person sick because of smoking  He have only himself to blame  you might say  But wait  There be still strong social pressure on many group to smoke  and once one start there be strong addictive pressure  I would not necessarily blame the person who have lung cancer because of his smoking  and certainly the consequence be completely unfitting if think of a a \u201c punishment \u201d for the unwise action  Yes  The shame be the important thing for me  Considering all the above  I realise that I can say  I have nothing to be ashamed of  And  even  I have nothing to be ashamed of  even if my condition be a paraphilia acting on a blank slate heterosexual normality

I have transition  I can see that other way of look at this may work for other people  For example  if the thought of transition completely terrify you  by all mean take refuge in the theory of Crossdreaming  I can see that it would be reassure to believe that your condition be merely a sexual fantasy  And if you be androphile TS  it may help you to despise and distance yourself from lesbian trans woman  Gosh  that be all heavy stuff  Here be some landscape painting by Vincent  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 52 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
