"transphobia"], "text": "The \u201c crossdressing Burnley burglar \u201d be serve an indeterminate sentence for public protection  after break into house and steal underwear and be charge with burglary and voyeurism  She videoed herself on her phone  in the underwear in the victim \u2019 bedroom  and the quote pick by the Lancashire Telegraph to give it reader an entertaining feeling of disgust  loathe and derision be \u201c I hope you don \u2019 t mind me borrow your underwear  They smell nice \u201d Possibly the sentence would not have be so great but for the video  The story be the bad kind for the trans community predatory trans in your daughter \u2019 s bedroom  get sexually aroused but these be upset thing to do  and ordinary decent reader of newspaper will want to read about them  Then she be back in the news because she be on hunger strike  This get a sympathetic writeup in The Observer  the Guardian \u2019 s Sunday paper   She claim that the prison authority \u201c deny her chosen gender \u201d  and it be not clear what that mean  She have be diagnose with gender dysphoria  she be in a men \u2019 s prison  and she claim prison official \u201c refuse to give hair straightener  epilator or any makeup \u201d  Hair straightener get hot  and could conceivably be use to assault someone  but if a friend outside be willing to give her makeup  or she can buy it herself  I don \u2019 t see why she should be deny it  A letter from friend outside say she should be \u201c give back her clothes \u201d  Convicted prisoner wear prison uniform  but she should be entitle to wear woman \u2019 s uniform  In the same prison run by incompetent profiteer Serco  Jenny Swift kill herself  She complain of \u201c bully \u201d  though Serco claim the prison officer be be \u201c robust \u201d  She be angry at officer call her \u201c fella \u201d  Prisons be understaffed and underfunded  with little or no attempt at rehabilitation and increase suicide  selfharm and violence  The indeterminate sentence indicate Marie Dean be see a a danger to the public  and that be not just from burglary  The judge must have believe her behaviour could lead to physical harm  She have no right to be in a woman \u2019 s prison  a the Ministry of Justice have to take care of her safety and that of other inmate  She have the right to be treat with dignity  and that mean be able to express herself a female and be free from violence  \u201c Assessments will be make on a case by case basis \u201d say the government  The story be a gift to the TERFs  and in the Murdoch press Janice Turner take advantage  Corbyn must decide if he \u2019 ll sacrifice ally who aren \u2019 t prepare to see woman \u2019 s safety compromise for the sake of dogma  This conflate two completely different issue  whether trans woman should be allow on all woman shortlist for appoint candidate for election  and whether a trans woman should be place in a woman \u2019 s prison  Gender identity do not erase biological reality  she argue  Well  so what  Jeremy Corbyn have decree that gender selfidentity be official policy  That mean that transition woman can get on all woman shortlist  and that Marie Dean should be allow to express herself a a woman and not be misgendered  It do not mean that she should be place in a woman \u2019 s prison  Marie Dean  and the disgust many will feel reading of her crime  be irrelevant to how trans woman should be treat  but trot out by Janice Turner to oppose any trans right at all  Notour TERF Sarah Ditum play the same game in the New Statesman  If be deny hair straightener can be present a a cruel and unusual punishment  one might imagine that housing female prisoner with a voyeur would rate somewhere even high  But in prison  a everywhere else  the expectation appear to be that woman \u2019 s safety come last  Belittle the difficulty the trans woman face  and conflate the threat she pose with issue pertain to trans woman generally  it \u2019 s so dispirit to hear Jeremy Corbyn on Marr this weekend  say thing like \u201c we should respect people however they identify \u201d or \u201c where you \u2019 ve selfidentified a a woman  then you be treat a a woman \u201d Also in the Murdoch press be the story that Women \u2019 s Aid be consider whether to employ trans woman  That be  an organisation run from top to bottom by woman  commit to the need of their service user and woman in general  with a great deal of expertise on those need and with knowledge of the relevant law  would make a decision in the interest of their organisation  They may decide to continue refuse to employ trans woman  However  that be boring  so to make the news entertaining we have a load of TERFs wheel out to make \u201c Help  help the sky be fall  \u201d
