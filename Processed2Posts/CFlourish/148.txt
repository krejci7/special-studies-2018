common interest identify a part of that group  choose it name for themselves and work in it interest  The name be \u201c Gender diverse \u201d  the ten percent or more of the population far enough from the Patriarchal ideal of what a man or woman should be to be most uncomfortable about it  We could see the damage do by the pressure of Patriarchy  and not be too critical about the way others cope  The name be not \u201c gendercritical \u201d  because that be a far large group  include even the most \u201c manly \u201d man who recognise that gender ideal do not fit people  and work against their injurious effect  because accept diversity liberate everyone  Nor be the name \u201c gender nonconforming \u201d  for that be a choice about how we cope with the problem  Twenty year ago I remark to Steve how like a straight man he seem  even appear to be mimic a straight relationship  Steve tell me he have have to learn to pass a straight because of his career  but after midnight in a 24 hour supermarket he notice most of the people there be gay men  \u201c And I camp it up with the rest of them \u201d  One of the objection to trans people be that we be gender ultraconforming  though social conservative do not agree  I don \u2019 t behave in an ultrafeminine way because I imagine that be how a woman should be  but because that be the close I can get to authenticity  I be not conform to my upbringing  Gender diverse include people happy in themselves  and people deeply unhappy  depend on how aware they be of the risk of nonconformity  how much they falsely value the false ideal  or how much in denial they be  We might disagree about complete solution  or the way forward now  but could agree on the basic problem  that patriarchy impose an ideal manliness or femininity which do not fit more than a tiny proportion of the population  We could recognise that while in your face nonconformity and gender transition be incompatible way of combat the problem  they be both brave way of subvert the patriarchal ideal  People suffer for them  We have a lot in common  however much soft men and virago appear different  The word \u201c virago \u201d be impose by men to control woman call unnatural  but have be claim by Virago Press  Those who choose other way of cop with gender diversity be not our enemy  They make choice we would not make but like u make those choice under oppression  We all do the best we can  Some will just live their life and undertake no political activity  Some have repellent views some trans woman support the US Republican party but it be the view that be repellent  not the transition  Each will campaign most for people who choose their particular solution  be most interested in the right of people most like them  I be trans  so I be a trans activist  But we can recognise commonality in others \u2019 suffering  and recognise their bravery in combat it  even if their solution be completely different from ours  We need to talk about transphobia  It exist  even if not everything a trans activist might call transphobic be  Just a some people be irrationally averse to spider  some be to trans folk  I have a good working relationship with a colleague  but when I transition at work she find it difficult  Knowing that the employer \u2019 s diversity policy  and English law  be on my side she explain it to me  She be revolt by me  I be sorry  I miss our useful cooperation  We keep apart as much a possible  and could talk when necessary  Most people be selfrighteous about transphobia  When a man I have never meet pass me in the street  hiss \u201c Fucking nonce \u201d  I wonder at how he hat me  to call me a sex offender  A woman write online  \u201c maybe I  a Socialist  will vote for Cruz because he will appoint conservative judge who win \u2019 t give in to the bathroom bullshit \u201d  Is not bodily autonomy and the right to birth control more important  Feminists should be ally to those describe by others a \u201c transexcluding \u201d  but might notice when someone may not have a sense of proportion about it  And many woman support trans woman  a friend tell me she would be outrage if a trans woman be exclude from the rape crisis centre where she work  Some object to \u201c trans ideology \u201d  It take bravery to transition  Because we be terrified and selfhating  many trans woman attempt to be hypermanly  The idea that we be \u201c really \u201d woman enable u to cease that hypocrisy  Years after transition  Jan Morris admit on the radio that she be not a woman  Before transition we reinforce patriarchy  After  we subvert it  Some of u be revolt  A prisoner game the system claim to be trans in order to be search only by female officer  then be sexually abusive  If the battle line be less fraught between some feminist and trans woman  then trans woman could curb the excess of our kind  Some of u try already  A woman put the case for exclude trans woman from woman \u2019 s bathroom tell me  \u201c I don \u2019 t want a woman who object to be automatically the one in the wrong \u201d  If we work together can we make good solution  Now  social conservative work to exclude trans folk from the toilet of our claimed gender  They pretend concern for woman  which might sound less hollow if they be work to reduce domestic violence  They be not your friend  but I hope we trans people can be  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 15 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
