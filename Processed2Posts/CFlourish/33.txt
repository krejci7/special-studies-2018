good thing  and at least three other mention of transgender  There be possibly more  but the magazine be too boring for me to bother look for them  This next bit be so vile I put it in small print  so you can dodge it if hate trigger you  \u201c What be it about transgender  \u201d I ask  \u201c They \u2019 re crazy  \u201d he say  This be before progressive norm prevent u even contemplate hate speech  \u201c How do you mean crazy  \u201d I ask  \u201c Aggressive  violent  disturb  disruptive  impossible to reason with  \u201d he say  \u201c Really crazy \u201d  This come after the writer claim to be bisexual  perhaps to indicate he could not possibly be prejudice  The tone of the writing be supposedly \u201c light and humorous \u201d  It \u2019 s awful  He refer to \u201c cut off the most definitive evidence of manhood \u201d  ask if a \u201c transgendered woman \u201d be \u201c actually or originally a woman or a man  \u201d and compare u to Otherkin  Well  noone be weird than me  but the author probably do that to make u look bad  Frankly  the science be a bit beyond me  That \u2019 s the Oldie \u2019 s schtick  pretend not to understand anything after about 1980  or anything at all really  Elsewhere in the magazine Virginia Ironside  their agony aunt  say In other word  and to use a vile expression  chill out  I don \u2019 t think she realise \u201c chill out \u201d have be replace by \u201c chill \u201d  Her objection be that it be a new phrase  not an old one  I \u2019 m still stick on the basic  bathroom right  male rapist declare themselves female to get transfer to woman \u2019 s prison  linebacker come out a woman to play professional football  He paint u a a ridiculous  disgust threat  He be delighted TERFs oppose u  Reactionary school of thought hope this be the progressive movement consume itself  That the contradiction will swallow the whole thing  What else  In a review of a film by Sally Potter  the writer say she give u a sublime Orlando  star Tilda Swinton a the transgenderiste  sic  Virginia Woolf heroine  Oh well  And in \u201c How to spot a decent vicar this Christmas \u201d there \u2019 s this  Forward in Faith \u2019 s website state  \u201c We be unable in conscience to accept the ordination of woman a priest and bishop \u201d  This view be increasingly absurd in an age of gender dysphoria  Martyn Percy  the Dean of Christ Church  Oxford  say  \u201c Will Forward in Faith be able to tell u at what point a person \u2019 s valid ordination either evaporates or crystallises in the process of gender transition  \u201d Michael Cole think the \u201c obsession with equality and diversity be kill quality television \u201d  because nothing damage TV more in his eye than have people different from himself on it  The survey would be ask me about my gender  \u2018 gender identity \u2019  age  ethnicity  sexual orientation and disability  Note the scare quote  a if gender identity be not a real category  He object  The real purpose of collect this information be to limit the creative freedom of people work in television\u2026  and  control what appear on the screen and who be in it  \u201c Who be in the screen \u201d  No  Michael  that be liquid crystal rotate polarised light  or in your case perhaps a stream of cathode ray  not tiny people  Trans be something new fangled  one more way the world be go to hell in a handcart  for Oldie reader and writer to resent  They have not hear of Elagabalus  Trans be as old a Deuteronomy  but with their affect ignorance they would not know that  Oh for the good old day when trans people would not be see  or heard  they say  Harry Mount  the editor  also write for the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph  This be the year of transgender moral panic  where we be the subject of daily press article abominate u  The transphobes be out in force  in what I hope be a desperate rearguard action to prevent our right and recognition  their desperation be a sign they know they will fail  but I fear my country \u2019 s increasingly authoritarian turn  I write that  then be so bored that I leaf through the rest of the magazine  For the fiftieth anniversary of Just a Minute  there be a lazy rehash of some of it joke  Giles Brandreth begin  \u2018 Nicholas  or a close friend know him  \u2018 Susan \u2019  be the first transsexual to host a panel show in this country  Oh God  there \u2019 s more of it  For relief  here be a writer not consume with anger about every change in his world  The Romanian homeless guy prays alongside the person who be transition and next to the old Etonian exarmy officer  People go through all sort of transitions go to university  start a family but you know exactly what Giles Fraser mean  and he expect all his audience to  Our language
