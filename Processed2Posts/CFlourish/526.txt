perspective  a delight \u201d  I have have my gonad remove  How be that not deeply harmful  a crippling  I take my transition very slowly and carefully  I decide to work towards transition in November 2000  and start on oestrogen and a testosterone suppressant in Summer 2001  but until April 2002 I be still present male at work  I have my operation in February 2004  though I could have have it after a year express myself female  I believe there be a theoretical possibility that I might at some time want to revert  So after so long suppress testosterone  I hardly think that the motivation to have the operation could have emerge from male sexuality  I get my gender recognition certificate  legally establish that my sex be female  in February 2006  It just felt so right  Even now  it just feel right  Now  I find the idea of have any part of my body remove revolting  but that delight me  But that just move the question one stage back  Is it not a deep sickness to want to have the gonad remove  It make me like those people who want a healthy limb amputate  I notice that a comment on that blog suggest that such people should have psychological treatment  rather than an amputation  just a some Christians ignorantly say about transsexual and gay people  I probably find BIID easy to understand than cissexuals do  though for those with BIID  of course  the amputation be the whole of the desire  The only answer I have so far be that transsexuality a a whole be a blessing  and this be an inextricable part of it for me  That be  the removal of my gonad  take away my ability to have child  be a bad thing but be more than compensate by all the other Good of the situation  I could not have have child anyway  I be too mess up in my 20 and 30 to be a good parent  and 45 be a bit late to start  I be more comfortable not produce testosterone  Orchiectomy go with the territory  the desire be part of the phenomenon of Transsexuality  In other word  you have to \u201c take the rough with the smooth \u201d  Um  There may be a good answer\u2026

I have not transition in order to anything  I have not transition in order to oppress radical feminist  or any woman chafe under cultural stereotype of womanhood  with an ultragirly stereotype  Nor to fool straight men into my bed so that I can humiliate them  There be strong argument that transition be against my interest  I be attract to woman  and I have greatly reduce the pool of woman who might be attract to me  I have expose myself to ignorant prejudice  and make it more difficult for me to find a job  I have transition because I want to  just that  in and for itself  To achieve only itself  That be what we mean when we call this a gender identity issue  because my present male be an act  a lie  and I could not bear it even though transition terrify me and I only transition when I could not bear to fight it any longer  This be who I be  So autogynephilia feel a if it can not be a cause of my condition  though it may coexist with it  Many woman with ovary find their own body sensual and erotic  And while I may have reduce the number of woman who might be attract to me  I have greatly increase my ability to relate to them  I could no longer pretend to be a man

Added  the reference from Transabledorg have lead a number of people  I presume some with BIID  to this page  Welcome  If I deny the hierarchy of oppression intersex people do not do themselves any favour by distance themselves from trans people then  Welcome  brother and sister  I want you to be happy  and a number of people will tell you how you should be happy  That be their stuff  not yours  You have to find out for yourself what will fulfil you  and pursue it  If living in a wheelchair  or even have an operation  be that  then it just be  My friend ask me before I start to live full time  if I could take a pill  like in The Matrix  and be a normal male  would I take it  No  I say  because I would not then be me  though this take some time to work out  If I could take a pill and be a normal woman  Her answer be still no  because the journey be worthwhile  I do not know on that one  If you could take a pill and have a normal body image  be happy with functional limb  would you take
