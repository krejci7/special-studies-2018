hear of trans woman not be able to see their child  With the difficulty of transition  some of u can not take on that additional fight  One I know kill herself after be tell her wife would not let her see her child  and at the funeral be erase  she be refer to only by her former name  a if a man have die  Now the English court have rule that a trans woman should not see her child  because they would be ostracise by their Orthodox Jewish community if she do  She can write four letter a year to each child  To write this post  I have read the detailed statement of evidence and law by the judge  but not his own assessment and conclusion  It be clear to me that any child bring up in such a \u201c community \u201d will suffer significant harm  People in this community be not responsible for their own life  \u201c Personal decision making be minimal  with all major concern be discuss with one \u2019 s rabbi \u201d  see paragraph 85 of the judgment   J  the father who have transition   58  know at the age of six that she be different  She could not speak to anyone  and pray to God to make it go away  Children in less controlling circumstance feel the same  I do not speak to anyone until age 18  After father five child and twice attempt suicide by take pill  she begin to speak to a therapist outside the community  Broken Rainbow  the LGBT domestic violence charity  give her confidence to leave  It have now close down  The community see transition a \u201c a defection from core value  and expressive of hostility and disrespect \u201d  106   The community can not accept how badly it hurt it member  so blames those who leave  The courtappointed Guardian accept that within the community  the child could not make their own decision about see their father  136   Exposure to the outside world be see a dangerous to the child  who be teach to see it a hostile to the Jewish community  The mother do not speak of J at all  Children expose to \u201c outside influence \u201d may be ostracise  The judgment give example of other divorced couple  One mother could not get her child into the school she want  \u201c The school would not risk the influence the father \u2019 s contact with the child might have on the rest of the student body \u201d This  note  be the case of a straight parent  In J \u2019 s case  her son A \u2019 s head teacher say that if A met J he fear A \u2019 s religious commitment could be compromise  In a case where a child be sexually abused within her family and the wide community from age 1114  she be foster through secular social service  She be not allow to talk to friend  whose parent say they could not risk their child hear about \u201c thing \u201d  J could not bear the thought that her son  age 12  would be face with her unexplained disappearance  so she tell him fifteen month before that she could not carry on with the marriage  and that she be leave five day before she do  This be hold against her  The pain she have suffer  in be unable to be herself  attempt to conform  find conformity impossible even though she know how much it would cost her to transition  and now in transition and suffer all that loss  be use against her to show that she should not have access  Telling her son be see a very bad indeed  Her own needs overwhelm her  120   she can not prioritise the emotional need of the child  which militate against contact  Their interpretation of the Torah be completely against transition  Deuteronomy 225 forbids dress in the clothes of the opposite sex  and Leviticus 2224 forbids castration  For all religious purpose J will be consider male  will be require to give a Get  or religious divorce  to her wife  93   and a most social activity a sexually segregate would not be allow to join either the woman or the men  The community fight viciously against J  Having so let her down  they project all their wrongdoing onto her  They threaten violence  61   They refuse to consult her about anything to do with the child  and would not accept maintenance payment from her  They rebuff all her attempt at contact  25   They make allegation that she have sexually abuse her son age 4  though the judge say \u201c There be no credible evidence that J have behave in a sexual manner towards D or any of the other child \u201d  32   The school respond particularly badly  Minutes of a \u201c Team around the child \u201d meet show their priority be to protect the community and enforce it \u201c cultural norm around gender and sexual identity \u201d  33   The school \u2019 duty be to \u201c uphold the religious ethos \u201d  Other parent would \u201c protect \u201d their child from information share by J \u2019 s child  Fortunately  school be restrict in England from so betray their pupil  I be horrify that any still persist  but at least one have be shut down  It be unlawful for a school to discriminate against a pupil because of their association with someone transition gender  48   The education regulation include a curriculum obligation to encourage respect for other people  pay particular regard to the protected characteristic set out in the 2010 Act  50   The school be forbid to enroll new pupil because it do not enable pupil to learn of the existence of trans people  It must encourage respect of u  and other group which suffer discrimination  Why the Department for Education be not shut down other such school  I do not know  The law support contact for parent  It be to be presume that contact further the child \u2019 s welfare  38   Children be entitle to the \u201c love and society \u201d of both parent  Court of Appeal case on trans parent say child should have professional help to learn of their father \u2019 s transition so they can adjust to the change  41   However the Guardian note that require \u201c a solid structure of support \u201d for the child  wide than the nuclear family  129   And yet J can not see her child  The eldest son be angry with his father  He blame J  \u201c If he care  he will leave me alone \u201d  139   He say his father have do him damage  The child can not recognise that the damage come from the Community failing to accept how human being be  and impose such terrible control  You can download the judgment from this page  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 18 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
