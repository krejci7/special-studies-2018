the Jehovah \u2019 s Witness you meet the other week  After our brief discussion  I realise that I have misunderstand your situation  I \u2019 m sorry if I offend you in any way  However  I \u2019 ve thought of another Scripture which can bring much comfort when it come to internal feeling and struggle  I John 31920  Sometimes our heart condemn u  but God know our heart well than we do  I hope that you find this to be of comfort to you  I wish you a pleasant day and week ahead  So I go to look up that passage  19 And by this we know that we be of the truth  and shall assure our heart before Him  20 For if our heart condemn u  God be great than our heart  and know all thing  I be little the wiser  Even the context do not assure me of what she be get at  and Neil Peart run in my mind He \u2019 s not afraid of your judgment He know of horror bad than your Hell He \u2019 s a little bit afraid of die And he \u2019 s a lot more afraid of your lying And the thing that he fear be a weapon to be use against him  So these be the verse I would use to claim God \u2019 s blessing on LGBT folk  First  Psalm 139 13 For You form my inward part  You cover me in my mother \u2019 s womb  14 I will praise You  for I be fearfully and wonderfully make  Marvelous be Your work  And that my soul know very well  Genesis 1  31 Then God saw everything that He have make  and indeed it be very good  God have not make a mistake  I still take the Bible seriously  and those two verse be a useful tool in my selfacceptance  And finally  Ecclesiastes passim  8 \u201c Vanity of vanity  \u201d say the Preacher  \u201c All be vanity \u201d And grasp for the wind  What be the point about debate what the Jews think two thousand year ago  anyway  I know the argument about the story of Sodom  and Paul \u2019 s condemnation of idolater  Jesus accept me  28 Come to Me  all you who labour and be heavy laden  and I will give you rest  Why should I care what anyone hostile think  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 I do care  It matter to me  I think this be because I want to fit in  and because I have not fit in naturally and happily  that have become very important to me  So I look out the rule  and seek to conform to them  because my spontaneous reaction have not fit in  and I have find that threaten  Or I want to seem to fit in  I want to be entirely under the radar  I hate be tell what to do the Evangelicals \u2019 price  and reward  of give clear rule to live by  but a lot of social togetherness  really do not appeal  This be why I see myself a a harlot  do good for what I can get from it  Proust  When we converse with someone  it be not we who be speak  but at such time we try to take on the semblance of other people  rather than be the self which differs from them  I want to survive  just to Exist  What do I want  more than that  Crivvens  I don \u2019 t know  Well  I want to express myself female  and after a huge amount of soulsearching  and then eighteen month \u2019 planning and creep towards it  I start to do so all the time  and that make no sense to me  other than it make me happy  I write this in 2007  I want to do the right thing  Always  So I will be safe  I want there to be a right thing to do  I want to know what it be  I want to be able to do it  I want to be able to work out the right thing to do  Always  So I will be safe  I get the sense  rationally  that there be no terrible social consensus police what I do  or care particularly much what I do  I think my desire  what make me happy  be actually constructive and creative and will not bring out anyone \u2019 s wrath  certainly not wrath which can really hurt me  And yet I have this terrible fear

8 February  Now  I would put it more clearly  I think my basic desire be constructive and creative  However  a lot of my desire to be good come from my desire not to be noticed the teacher \u2019 s pet do not get shout at and also  feel worthless  I want external validation  I feel a great deal more selfrespect and selfvaluing than before  and seek external validation never work for me  I need my own  But the desire to be good in order not to be notice be still strong in me  If I can free myself from that  then I may pursue my own desire  So  free myself from the need to be a good person  I become one
