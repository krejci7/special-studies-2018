"tags": ["trans", "transition"], "text": "Before I start express myself female at work  I would spend all weekend female  On Sundays I go to the Metropolitan Community Church  the church found to welcome and accept gay people  and after we would go for a drink or a meal together  On the Monday morning I would be present male again  and not nice to know  I be stress and angry  As a friend say  at first present male be normal  and express female be Wonderful  Then express female be really nice  and present male a bit of a pain  Finally express female be normal  and present male unbearably horrible  Yet let the man out remain possible  When I saw this video first  it be an excerpt  share on facebook  and I wonder how someone have just happen to film it a confrontation between a rude man and a trans woman  without any explanation that it be a \u201c social experiment \u201d  Yet herhis reaction  snap  respond in a male way be something we will recognise  A friend of a friend living on a council estate be bully until she turn and beat up one of her tormentor  but be the man again traumatise her  My friend change job  city  friend when she transition  but have loose end from her old life to tie up  We be have lunch  and the phone rang  Hello  hello I \u2019 m busy at the moment  Can we talk later  It be the one time I saw her male self  It be shock  and seem aggressively rude  That video excerpt  without the commentary show it be stag  seem stag to me  but it be something I could recognise  Off I go to stay with J  and we would go out round North Wales  and I get a gorgeous even gown in a sale in Prestatyn  then I would have to put on the male to go to work  I have try so hard to make a man of myself  That seem to be the alternative to transition Machoman  act what a real man should be  terrify of get find out and loathe the act  feel constant anger and fear  Transition be liberation  I finally get to be myself  \u2665\u2665\u2665 I be uncomfortable  now  in the role of \u201c trans woman \u201d  I would rather be otherwise  I write this  a a draft blog post  What do I want from transition  What do it achieve for me  How you see it matters positive or negative  I have be view it negatively  which have drag me down  Perfectionism and black and white think make it bad  What do I gain  or lose  by it  I saw transition a a sacrifice to buy acceptance  I can \u2019 t be like this a a man only a a woman  Then I find that I still have difficulty express myself female  Or  I saw at the time that \u201c I be not a transsexual \u201c  I don \u2019 t fit the box others have create  I be myself and yet my transition be pretty much a I saw standard transitioning  Hair removal  hormone  transition at work  gender confirmation surgery  present in an entirely binary way a a woman  even if not see a one but a a trans woman  That be I do not do it simply to please myself  but also to placate others  I live up to what I saw society expect of trans woman  And that do not work  because it be a cultural expectation or stereotype which do not fit how people actually react  what people want or expect  It be a coarse concept  while interaction with others be ever change  \u2665\u2665\u2665 My draft be just not how I felt at the time of transition  Nor how I felt when I want the operation  when delay and setback immiserated me  step towards Thailand elate me  Possibly there be some unconscious motivation like that unconscious motivation  I think  make me go against my own interest  a I judge myself all the time  Transition felt authentic and desired  but it could not have be really  I second guess myself I be back see my radical feminist friend  so possibly my unconscious motivation for write that draft be move more to her way of thinking  I be think this through  and unsure that thinking have any value you can \u2019 t avoid misstep except by not move  which be bad  Do what you feel you want and learn by your mistake  My draft sound so sincere  so convincing  Except now I be write the opposite  I be just too confused  I don \u2019 t know what I want  Just like when I have aversion therapy  I have two view  I have a stressful job  If I want to relax by crossdressing  it be completely harmless  I be a man  and crossdressing be unmanly  so I should stop  Either of these seem reasonable to me  but change between perfect conviction of one  then the other  then the first again  within six or eight week  terrify me  It be mad  And expensive  buying clothes and throw them away  Eventually I manage to buy a gorgeous dress  keep it  but not wear it for a year  Then I start crossdress again  I start on this post thinking of ask you  Well  what be the alternative to transition  It felt like that macho act be the only one  but can you live like a feminine male  A Betamale  perhaps  Would you change from your normal appearance  which give a lot of ci privilege  if there be any alternative  Being Betamale and quite that feminine be far more frightening than transition  perhaps because transition be the societally sanction escape route  What part do sexual arousal play in this  Would that I could divorce arousal from how I live my life  Would I have transition if I have not be arouse by the thought  I do not know myself  I seek to know myself  It be now the most important thing to me  ",
