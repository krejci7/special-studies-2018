attractive  Others say that people with the sexual orientation of autogynephilia transition in that case I be bisexual between an autogynephilic orientation and a gynephile orientation  a I be attract to woman other than myself  The real world be more complex than theory can portray  Others say the phenomenon be Trans  where female soulsbrainspsyches in male body be only happy once transition  and child as young a three can experience bodily dysphoria  loathe their penis  This be the \u201c trans ideology \u201d so hat by the TERFs  If I be really a woman  of course I should be allow in woman \u2019 s space  I say I be sortof culturally a woman  an anomaly  so should be tolerate in woman \u2019 s space  because the majority of woman so tolerate me  and because I be harmless and we be mostly harmless  Or I could say that I be Different  so for the comfort of the Normal people I have to be shove into a box  and when I could not tolerate the Man box the Transwoman box be the other one available  The goal of Diversity be that noone should be shove into a box  Possibly what you want to do govern what you think about it  I want to transition  so I think I be transsexual  And what your identity be affect what you do  I think true transsexual have sex reassignment surgery  so I have sex reassignment surgery  So there be different name for it  validate it gender confirmation surgery be the late I hear  Neovagina  say the surgeon  make it sound good  \u201c Fxxk hole \u201d  say the radical feminist  communicate her contempt  This post about identity be write by someone who oppose transition  People approach medical service say they be trans  and seek medical reassignment  Their identity be that of a trans person  They believe they be a trans person  and that that mean hormone and surgery  Lisa Marchiano wish to treat gender dysphoria a a symptom  and explore with her patient what that symptom mean  Gender dysphoria cause distress  The identity model say the person be trans  and the way to alleviate the distress be medical transition  Marchiano be against transition  it be a \u201c drastic  permanent medical intervention \u201d  lead to \u201c permanent  lifelong sterility 100  of the time \u201d  One never read in such article that transition make some people happy and higherfunctioning  but it do  I would be happy if the writer admit the value of transition for the patient in some case  She value selfidentity  We tell ourselves story about ourselves  I identify a Quaker  Scots  English  culture  These thing matter to me  The therapist accept them empowers me  The therapist only challenge them if they lead to maladaptive behaviour  Yet how can I know myself  I identify the Real Me a female  but now identify it a feminine  I be a pansy  My selfidentification often be change by the word I use  I seek more accurate word  She say gender dysphoria do not mean necessarily that I be trans  but that the therapist need to explore the meaning of the symptom and be open to what emerge  That she question selfidentity a trans do not mean she treat the symptom a unimportant or illusory  She break down gender dysphoria into separate symptom  include alienation from one body  I hat the slimness of my arm  because it seem weak and unmanly  Now I love my arm and hand  which I find beautiful  Finding a way to accept me a me  rather than accept aspect of my body because they fit \u201c woman \u201d and I identify a \u201c trans woman \u201d  accept what be  and find the good in it would have be good than transitioning  if only I could have pull it off  Teenage girl be alienate from their body by porn culture  and she say they decide transition be the answer due to a social contagion  it be the answer they find  and they latch onto it  then seek out evidence to confirm it  which they find in many site provide mutual reassurance   As do the radical feminist who decide we be monstrous then seek evidence and reassurance to confirm that   I be homophobic and femmephobic a man should not be feminine  I think  It be not internalise transphobia  but femmephobia  How much good to relieve my selfloathing than to force me into the transwoman box which I think fit my feminine self  She say there be often other mental health condition  One doctor say I have narcissistic personality trait  another deny it  and those trait might cause or be cause by the dysphoria  but find a way of alleviate them might make the dysphoria less serious  I see no evidence that she accept transition a an appropriate course for anyone  She attack \u201c transgender ideology \u201d a incoherent  She say there be no basis for a \u201c gender identity \u201d  her scarequotes  that supersede \u201c objective biological sex \u201d  This make her assessment of research on outcome suspect  though I doubt you would find an objective metaanalysis  untainted by any desire to affirm or deny transition a a treatment  Her reference to \u201c a latetransitioning MtT autogynephile \u201d link to Anne Lawrence  That be hostile  Here she write that trans people exist  and should be protect  but she would rather manage gender dysphoria without transition  I feel her position have harden far since  But I agree that we should explore the anima and animus  male and female  within ourselves  I love her desire to explore deeply the source of distress and seek varied possible solution  That be not the NHS model  which favour quick fix  even bodges  We would see the person in front of u in all of their miraculous complexity  and not just a a \u201c gender identity  \u201d she say  If only  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 7 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
