seem to me that my Real Self fit idea of femininity mine  and the wider culture \u2019 s so much good than masculinity that present a visibly trans I appear less weird  and can relate to people a my real self well  and I be far more comfortable express female  The heart of privilege be be value or discount because of appearance clue  Privilege arise from appearance  Carey Callahan  a FMF detransitioner  have the privilege that she pass a a ci woman at least on video  and it be not immediately apparent that she be physically affect by transition  Her voice sound like a woman \u2019 s husky voice  rather than a voice break by testosterone  This be all lead up to something  Rape threat and death threat be deprave  I cast around for the right word  reject \u201c disgust \u201d because it do not seem to condemn strongly enough  \u201c deprave \u201d  lack some essential part of humanity and civilisation  applies  Someone who tweet penis picture to stranger be deprave  Carey share a Storify  It be not safe for work  contain those penis picture  We need to know the detail of such threat  because we need an immediate personal apprehension of their gravity and wrongfulness  but if you already have that you don \u2019 t need to look  It be by gnccentric  who call a trans woman a male and retweets \u201c cisgendertransgender \u201d be a false dichotomy that assume some essential womannaturemannature  There \u2019 s only humannature  Yet another reason I hate twitter it can be use for bald statement to encourage one side of a conflict  but people persist in use it to argue  though no nuance be possible  I could refute her tweet with a thousand word blog post perhaps I will but on twitter there can be little more than bald disagreement  Gnccentric could just brush that off  So depraved people  want to make their disagreement matter  resort to rape threat  and other depraved people  troll for lulz  make the threat to intimidate and disgust their target  and fantasise about the reaction they provoke  Gnccentric tweet back ask how would Emily feel on the receive end  and express contempt and derision for the threat  but may still be affect by them  I understand some woman lose selfconfidence  and engage online le  What to do about the rape threat  I think Twitter should employ human to deal with complaint timeously  suspend account which utter them  and take action to identify human being  not just IP address or twitter account  produce them  Whatever  effective action be need  and it be down to the company not the Twitter community  Here \u2019 s Carey \u2019 s video about the storify  I paraphrase  with direct quote in italic  I \u2019 m do with be scar of be label a TERF\u2026 my politics do not exclude trans people  I be invest in the wellbeing of everyone who experience gender dysphoria male or female trans identify or not  Mainstream feminist site be angry about rape threat in other situation but certain opinion like the necessity for female space but other opinion too which get label TERF everyone kind of agrees that whatever attack you get and whatever violence you get you deserve and I just don \u2019 t buy it I don \u2019 t think there be a person who deserve a rape threat\u2026I \u2019 m do with take seriously the feminism of people who use that word  If you use that word you be enable and collaborate with those kind of threat and harrassment  and you should stop  If you send a picture of your penis to a stranger you be have a mental health crisis and your community should deal with you  That word need to die  Ok  I be a trans woman  I think all rape threat be deprave  and nothing can justify them  And that charge against mainstream feminist site be so grave that it need strong evidence  Mere failure to mention TERFs in discussion of rape threat be not enough  I have a look at the twitter feed of Emily Eldritch  who send the penis picture  Now it be EmyAmythyst  whose tweet be only accessible to confirm follower  but who have picture of Pepe the Frog imagine my best out of touch high court judge voice when I say \u201c A symbol of the altright  I understand \u201d  in drag and in a Donald Trump wig  and a butterwouldn \u2019 t melt femme face with a large gun  Nothing that person say can be take seriously  She will do anything to shock  and to destabilise her opponent  We on the Left want human connection and understanding  She want to watch our world burn  It might not be a trans woman  but a troll who think a trans woman persona would be useful to attack particular target  and possibly to poison relation between trans woman and potential ally  Judge her on her act  a an individual  She be not valid evidence of what trans woman in general be like  She do not speak for anyone but herself  To use her to make generalisation about trans woman  to say that the trans community should deal with her  or to make decision about anything to do with trans because of her is unfair  I suppose  That be not me  not anything like me  Don \u2019 t make it my job to deal with her I tweet her a rebuke  but doubt it would have a useful effect or judge me because she continue her offensive way  It be possible for u to talk  to create understanding  but she be merely a distraction  Please don \u2019 t turn away from me because she exist  Human being try to make their way in the world  We forge career  make relationship  Transition take a huge amount of effort and energy  It be the most important thing in the world for me  and everything else get put on hold  and now I be in survival mode  with the project of value myself  turn my selfloathing into appreciation  without which it seem I can achieve nothing at all  If you detransition  it might seem that all that effort be waste  transition be a massive oppressive con against gender nonconforming people  At first you might want to find some meaning or purpose in your transition  but that might fade with time  I imagine you might move from some sympathy for transidentified people we be all in the same toxic trap to rejection  a you put it behind you and get on with your life  That rejection  though  might carry all the resentment you feel for the hurt you have suffer  and we don \u2019 t deserve that  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 19 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
