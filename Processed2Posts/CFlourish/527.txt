time  and they do a all people do  they do their best under difficult circumstance  Can I really blame them  Perhaps I can blame circumstance  the monstrous European colonialism and warmongering  the need to control  the belief in an ideal of \u201c normal \u201d  the disdain for the Other  the tramline thinking  It be personify for me in Alfred  Graf von Schlieffen  whose name be give to the German plan to sweep through Belgium and France  and encircle and capture Paris  There be nowt so silly a the Rational Man  poor von Kluck  yes  really  cluck cluck  have no option but to turn southeastwards  open his flank to attack at the Marne  and bog down half of Europe in France for four year  But the Schlieffen plan be the product of the German need for selfdefence against an alliance of Britain  France and Russia  It come from the Enlightenment and the human desire to understand and control which also bring forth the Industrial Revolution  to our great benefit  and which have arguably lead to our current new Spiritual enlightenment  So it be inextricably interweave with something wonderful   Gosh  be positive can be a pain sometimes   So  anger at whom  One good target be those middle class type who treat me a a man  That be gross discourtesy  and they ought to know good  None for month  and then three in two week  Derek  a yoga teacher  forsooth the correct pronoun be \u201c she \u201d not \u201c he \u201d  And Klaus  with your five \u201c spiritual \u201d book in eighteen month  three now edit for publication  a positively Blytonian output  and Robin  lecturer in and supervisor of counsellor  all you Spiritual  advance  mature type  I be not a \u201c crossdresser \u201d  I be entitle to enough respect from you that you avoid crass discourtesy  Because be transsexual be a great blessing  a unique perspective  a wonder to be  and a wonder to behold if you can silence your prejudice and preconception  and just perceive  It will not do  Yes  anger at the ignorance of my culture for turn the glorious  beautiful phenomenon of Transsexuality a thing of wonder  a blessing into a shameful subject of mockery and disgust  Anger at my parent  No  Anger at my parent  now  feel manufacture  I have do anger at my parent  and while I may have more to do that be not what I need to do now

I only decide in August it be the immediate cause of this blog that be transsexual be a blessing  Before  I think it a curse  Before I decide to transition  I go with a friend to her church  and we go for coffee in the church hall afterwards  I be dress female  and a member of the congregation talk to me a if I be a normal person  And that felt so strange to me  and in fact wrong  she ought to be express distaste  she ought to be uncomfortable with me  a man dress a a woman  I have message from my world and my culture that how I was with testicle and desire to express myself female be entirely wrong and disgusting  and I accept that and take it in to myself and turn my anger inwards  at myself for be transsexual  rather than outwards at those who would cast me out because of this wondrous and beautiful aspect of me  This may not be the heart of the matter  but it be the piece of the jigsaw to place  Now  I need to feel and express that anger outwards  Until I can do this work  I be stuck  I have an idea of how I might be  after  with the middle class type who use the wrong pronoun  or word like \u201c crossdresser \u201d  \u201c Autogynephilia \u201d  even \u201c transsexual \u201d   I do not  now  get catcall in the street   I could be express my love for them  invite to share my wonder and delight  see me in my beauty and paradox  Or  just ignore them  it be their stuff not mine  First  I need to turn the anger outwards

I can generalise that  Having no sense of my own value  when thing do not turn out a I have hop I get angry with myself and blame myself  That be not in proper balance  There will be time when I could do good  and must try harder  but beat myself up until I give up be unproductive  There will be time when anger at others be appropriate  I do not need to express it  but I may permit myself to feel it  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 53 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
