complains\u2026 people generally give him the benefit of the doubt because boy be tough and never complain for no reason  When a girl complain about seemingly nothing  she be label a whiney drama queen  When mean that an early school age girl on the autistic spectrum  when she be overstimulated  in pain  or confuse have be program from birth to shut up and try to make herself as small a possible while she figure out what be go on  Boys be entitle  girl be sham  In order to function invisibly at the level that most autistic woman do  you need to hate yourself and be afraid all the time  That get me research  Here \u2019 s the Sexual assault prevention and awareness center of the University of Michigan  on how socialisation to stereotype cause batter  Girls be teach to be passive  smile  be nice  accommodating  take care of and be sensitive to other \u2019 s need  Beyond \u201c teaching  \u201d our culture actively punish girl who violate those rule  Such punishment include social ostracism  ridicule  poor grade in school  and often time sexual harassment  assault  and physical violence\u2026Batterers express emotion of anger  pain  grief and loss very well  They do cry\u2026Men have be teach through social role model and the medium that they be entitle to the attention and service of woman  Women be require to listen  be supportive  enhance their partner \u2019 status with other men  fulfill the man \u2019 s sexual need  and care for their child  cook  clean and maintain the household  This be the Women and Gender Advocacy Center of Colorado State University  it be transfriendly  and more kind to those men  which may be an aspect of the socialisation or personality of the writer   The most dominant form of manhood be call \u201c hegemonic masculinity \u201d which be characterize by several key tenet  1   distance oneself from femininity  2   restrict emotion  3   be tough and aggressive  avoid vulnerability   4   be see a highly sexual with woman  and 5   prove one \u2019 s heterosexuality via homophobia  The site show the Man Box  Inside the box be a list of socially value role and expectation that constitute conventional masculinity  and the word outside of the box be use to confine boy and men into a narrowly constructed definition of manhood  Luna Merbruja put a trans woman \u2019 s perspective in Everyday Feminism  She argue that you must be male to benefit from male privilege  We be not male  Cis woman be raise to cook  clean  smile  endure sexual harassment  be silently ashamed about their menstrual cycle  and prioritize child bearing and marriage  These be the supposed commonality that bind cis woman together a share experience that trans woman don \u2019 t have  The truth be  a b binaohan state in the \u201c female socialization \u201d chapter of decolonize transgender 101  we all have the same socialization  We be all teach what boys and girl be like  and trans girl be punish for not be manly  Also on Everyday Feminism  Kai Cheng Thom argue that the denial of our true self a child  the punishment for not be manly  be like gaslighting  deny the victim \u2019 s perception of reality  which traumatise u  \u2665\u2665\u2665 SAPAC be angry  Men be entitle  and woman suffer  WGAC le so  men suffer too  It point out that most murderer be men  but also most victim of male murderer  Anger matter  it affect what arguments someone will hear  That list Cis woman be raise to cook  clean  smile  endure sexual harassment  be silently ashamed about their menstrual cycle  and prioritize child bearing and marriage\u2013 well  I be not raise to that  My sister be teach to cook  and when I go to University my mother do not want me starve  so give me four simple recipe  which I still use  and a cake recipe I do not  The argument be that the violence we experience be equivalent  which be close to play oppression olympics\u2013 at least  while the violence may not be directly comparable  so the question which be bad do not make sense  the violence we experience be traumatise  If you see on TERF site woman trivialise the violence we experience  you know that be hate  and violence in itself  I puzzle these thing out through my own experience  My question  How be I wrong  How can I change to fit in  How may I support myself without help  and my virulent inner critic torture me  I seek to be invisible  These be not the response of a Privileged individual  they be closer to Diane \u2019 s experience  program to shut up and make herself small  \u2665\u2665\u2665 There be a difference  I fit the female socialisation I do not have good than many woman  want to support others  and create reconciliation  if not particularly to clean my house to be subservient\u2013 fit me  I could be call a caricature  and enrage woman who do not fit it  So I insist  I do not manifest like this because I imagine it be womanly  or feminine  but because it be the real me  It be how I be  before I realise I be transsexual  How that be link to my desire to express myself female hair  makeup  clothes  selfexpression on the feminine end of woman \u2019 s expression I don \u2019 t know  Either could cause the other  They could arise from some hormonal or genetic cause  or be unrelated  I don \u2019 t think I be say  people with that personality be suppose to look like that because I don \u2019 t think that would be strong enough to make me seek physical transition  But if me associate my personality with woman  rather than men  be the cause of my transition  then it be a clear case of me be oppress  rather than empower  by socialisation  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 26 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
