pansy  a feminine male  Before transition  I felt social pressure to conform to standard of masculinity  but I be aware of \u201c transsexual \u201d  I felt liberate when I could express myself a Clare  In May 2000  I decide to transition  That decision last less than a week  I go to the local TVTS group and sat with the TSs  None of them have job  They seem miserable  They do not seem to pass particularly well  I think I could not do it  Then at another group I find trans woman who seem to be able to make a go of life  and in November 2000 I decide to transition  I transition in April 2002  and still express myself a female  I have no plan to revert  As I understand it at the time  there be two kind of people with a Y chromosome who dress a woman  There be transvestite  who do it for sexual kick  and transsexual  who do it because they be really woman  TVs be pervert  ridiculous and disgusting  but TSs have a medical condition  and be not to be condemn  I do not feel able to express my feminine self a a man  so the alternative be to transition  I want to transition  so I be TS  In the Northern Concord  of those who do not proclaim themselves TS  there be still people who be like bloke down the pub who happen to be dress strangely  and some very feminine type  I be friendly with the latter  and some later transition  I want sex reassignment surgery  I pay for it  Now  I believe that I have it because of social pressure  because it be part of my understanding of what a transsexual be  Some of that pressure come from the transsexual support group  but also from ci folk  who talk of a \u201c sex change \u201d  Now  many who transition full time do not have SRS  We be \u201c Trans \u201d  which include crossdresser  We can make our own path within Trans  rather than be classify a one or the other of TVTS  There may be social pressure to identify a trans  Social pressure to identify a trans   My Daughter Is Not Transgender  She \u2019 s a Tomboy   http  tcoilkkxE8Nz4 \u2014 Ray Blanchard   BlanchardPhD  April 23  2017 I discuss that article in detail  The mother find professional and others surprise that her daughter be not trans there be social pressure but mother and daughter be resist it  It do not show that people transition because of social pressure  that someone comfortable with gender nonconforming behaviour will transition  and certainly not that anyone who could conform to the ci gender stereotype would feel any pressure to transition  It also support the cisnormative default  the girl be think to be trans  because she be not like girl be suppose to be  But she could still fit social expectation if she be trans  confirm how girl and boy be different though the mother writes of others \u2019 surprise  not disapproval  The gender nonconformist who refuse to transition be the real social pariah  Talk of \u201c social pressure \u201d imply that we be in some way unfree  unfulfilled or prevent from selfactualisation  I would say that I felt I could be more myself if I conform to the concept of the transsexual woman  so I leap at the chance  Cisnormativity create transgender  I would not have need to transition have I be able to live a a flamboyant pansy  still male   \u201c Been \u201d able or felt able  Social pressure be too strong for me   That be  there be social pressure on the gender nonconforming person to satisfy societal expectation  either by conform to gender expectation of their sex or by transition  Aged 51  I feel more able to resist social pressure  but possibly I be just ignore  I cycle to the station and take off my wig  unable to bear it  \u201c You need a pair of long earring  \u201d say that woman  Um  Probably strong makeup too  There be an acceptable look for bald woman  but it certainly be not my male pattern baldness  with hair thick round the back and side but wispy or absent on top  I be paranoid about that even though I shave the side  \u2665\u2665\u2665 I try that line on a trans activist facebook group  Cisnormativity create transgender  One say Dysphoria be an emotional response to the gender variation of self  which may be a misunderstanding  Cisnormativity create the idea that a boy should be \u201c boyish \u201d  and grow up to be \u201c manly \u201d  But it may be a disagreement  She be really a woman  she think  Another say she observe in child age 2 or 3 distress at possess a penis  I find it disturb that the child  who be allow to dress a a girl  should know that penisboy  and not wholly credible without some parental pressure  but she believe that  How you see it depend on your theory  I say we transitioners  detransitioners  closet people  open gender nonconformists  be all the same  all people who do not fit gender stereotype  who respond to the difficulty that cause in different way  She say she be a woman with a trans history  yes  really a woman  How you behave depends on your theory  I might not have transition have I not believe I really be transsexual  Later  I realise the question which matter be \u201c Will I be happy if I transition  \u201d  what do I want to do  rather than who be I or what be my fundamental nature  I resist transition  imagine I be not really TS  thinking I be autogynephilic instead  I say \u201c nonbinary \u201d be a freedomword  a claim I make when I want to act in a particular way  not a separate way of be human a bi or gay be  Different people might argue we be all NB  or all trans  or all GNC  and would act differently because of their theory  Which word you choose may either retrospectively justify your desire  or alter the way you express that desire  The way you do not fit stereotype may be minimal or extreme  and how much that distress you will differ  It be not just we who debate these thing  The doctor  and the wider society  debate them too  Some people  not personally affect  argue for what they think be good for the individual  some for the wider society  have different idea of what it mean to be man  woman  human  Ignorant people have strong opinion  Should people have access to crossgender hormone and surgery  Should society repress gender nonconformity a a perversion  or only permit it to be express in a particular way  We can \u2019 t make our decision isolate from the wider conversation  and we may be angry with people try to push u into a path  or an understanding of the phenomenon  when it \u2019 s not the one we want  On another trans group  person after person anticipates or celebrate their SRS  That I feel now I have it because of social pressure do not mean that anyone else do  For some dysphoria mean a loathing of the body because it do not fit the person  which be cure by surgery  All this be an introduction to the article in The Stranger  and particular response to it  \u2665\u2665\u2665 Katie Herzog write an article  The Detransitioners  They Were Transgender  Until They Weren \u2019 t  Julia Serano and others respond  Katie Herzog write again  woundedly say she be only a journalist reporting people \u2019 s story and expert \u2019 opinion  and Julia Serano write again  Briefly  I feel the problem be that people want to make their own decisions transition  detransition  surgery  hormone  behaviour but feel that express opinion about others \u2019 decision may make their own more difficult  As Serano write  trans community be highly aware of how notion of \u201c social contagion  \u201d \u201c trendsgender  \u201d and \u201c cisgender people be turn transgender because of peer pressure \u201d be routinely use by those who wish to rollback transgender right and access to healthcare  We win \u2019 t get hormone if others be simply gender nonconforming and public pressure say take crossgender hormone be icky  they will not permit it  But then I say we don \u2019 t make our decision free of public pressure  We may feel that pressure in different way  a there be no consensus  Detransitioners  social conservative and TERFs say Transition be Bad  Social liberal recognise that men have be dress a woman since Deuteronomy and probably long before  and there be a tradition of trans surgery go back to Lili Elbe  Depending on the circle we move in or what we read  different option present themselves to u  and what attract u to one rather than the other may be luck or chance  Serano have also write  stop pit detransitioners against happily transition people  Yes  We \u2019 re the one who have to live with our nonconformity  We share a lot of common interest  We should strive to minimize unwanted irreversible change  she say  Of course  But when I so badly want SRS in 2003  I do not know I would regret it later  This be long enough already  I may come back to these article  I want u all to be able to make whichever decision feel right for u  to deal with gender issues but we can not do that in a vacuum  a if there be no social pressure  It be continue  Social
