woman feel and man understands feeling through her  woman \u2019 s state be from upbringing so I can never be a woman and the mutilation be so appalling  It \u2019 s six in the morning  and I lie in bed  my fragile sense of self reel before your obsidian judgment of me not a reflection  Not a reflection  You write of this middleaged porn user  \u201c Jim \u201d  who tell you his wife do not know of his habit  and of your disgust at how this might affect his role a a father and grandfather  in such a way that he might be identifiable  Beware the stranger to whom you confess  You consider use my name in your writing  and I fear  and come back to that desire  Attention  What good would that do me  Some make a career of it  successfully  but the motivation come before see that  And I flee attention Philip say I \u201c want to blend into the background in the most eyecatching way possible \u201d  Bad thing with bad word like drama queen for male or female  Though perhaps a \u201c drama queen \u201d be one who seek attention  inexpertly  a a \u201c nag \u201d be a manipulator who have be notice  It be a childhood desire  My mother \u2019 s story  What do you want to be when you grow up  A conductor  A bus conductor  No  an orchestral conductor  She love the contempt   a I say it  I know myself through other \u2019 s eye  Or at least  I know myself but seek confirmation through other \u2019 s eye  to make it real for me  I would prefer applause  and note the idea that child crave attention and act up to get it  Children  Not mature  adult  independent though human be not independent some be more than others you write of me be tempt  even though you might would almost certainly excoriate me more than gosh  I hope \u201c Jim \u201d be a pseudonym mirrors I need you to see me so I may see myself  rather than to be that I may see myself in you  which be how I understand that essay on Hegel  You know  a I write this I don \u2019 t know if I be extract myself or dig myself deep  I feel powerless  but powerlessness to this Judge be not an excuse  If I be flail about seek answer  I may heedlessly trample others I don \u2019 t want to hurt anyone  I want reconciliation before all else  I be soft  gentle  peaceful  and that open me to this Judgment  a a deliberately cruel man might trample that too  It be not affirm of him so he ignore it  It \u2019 s all about them  say the commenters on your article  Men confess  After too much porn  they can \u2019 t get an erection from ogle a shortskirted woman in the street  No absolution from these women so trample on them be the only way to selfregard  I begin to understand Miriam Afloat  That \u2019 s the blog allegedly of a trans woman who parrot radfem rejection of trans woman  Possibly  it really be a trans woman  accept that judgment  for it be how she can be good  Thesis  antithesis synthesis  \u2665\u2665\u2665 What Jim the porn user want be absolution  Not priestly absolution with repentance and amendment of life  but liberal absolution yes  you might think it a bit yuck  but lot of people do it  it \u2019 s nothing to be worry about  In the hippyish  liberal place you meet he might have expect that  He do not get it  There be so much anger here  a commenter say  Given the level of sexist hate crime in family  it might be helpful to give his female family member a head up so that they have inform consent whether he stay in the house or not \u2026  It be possible \u201c Jim \u2019 s \u201d wife may be aware of the article and  because you use your own name  have identify her husband  You risk break their marriage  I tend to feel my sweetness and charm will win people over  and if that do not work sympathy with my hard life and suffering might help  Not with these people  for whom I symbolise all they rage at  I write to the break  then go to see Richard  \u201c Of course you be a woman  \u201d he reassure me  \u201c Do not listen to her \u201d And a you might see from the writing  I be reassure  I always feel ill after meet you  and yet I feel your particular perspective may help me know myself  which be my main desire  I want attention as well a absolution  as well a to hide away  and want to know what that mean  I want to stop be at war with myself  And I want to accept the hostility  I be arrogant for decide how I dress  because that harm woman  someone I think moderately friendly tell me  It be just there  It be from hurt  and righteous anger resist the hurt even though I hurt too and do not cause their hurt  Just accept it  It be there  Collage by Kathy
