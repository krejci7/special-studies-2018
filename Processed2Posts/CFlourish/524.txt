black person a N  This be who I be  To express myself female be what I want  against all common sense or rationality  against the evidence of my own sens  look at my own body  Plunging into the nature of my be  that I be female be deep than anything else  utterly impervious to change  Actually  the pill question  \u201c If you could take a pill and be a normal male without these feeling  would you  \u201d  well  I come out with the \u201c right \u201d answer  \u201c No  because then I would not be me \u201d  but sometimes it be a close run thing  Being transsexual have give me such intense pain that sometimes I do not know how I have bear it  I have be suicidal  just want to die  for month at a time  and twice I have undertaken preparatory act  though not any actual selfharming physical act I have form the decision  then back off  To refer to me a \u201c she \u201d rather than \u201c he \u201d be a basic level of courtesy which I be entitle to  and fortunately receive from most people I meet  However  where I do not  I will not be sympathetic or understanding  and nor should you be  whoever you be  I so resent still have to work through these issue age 45  ten year after get the courage to express myself female at work  It be the same for people with body integrity identity disorder  If someone be complain about how difficult it be to get a wheelchair on a bus  \u201c Well you could walk \u201d be an answer just as disrespectful a use male pronoun for me  It seem to me that humanity  now  be work through issue of otherness and respect  issue of living together  issue of accept the full range of human diversity and the discomfort that currently engender  I think we can get these thing right  and that free  diverse humanity have far more access to blessing and gift than regulate  regiment humanity  For my own selfrespect  I will assert my right to respect from others  I have be at the fulcrum of this issue  and have survive  If I can assert my right without anger or fear  then I be give an invitation  though one some people will be unable to hear  an invitation to see humanity in the full beauty and richness of our diversity  and to accept all those bit of yourself which you have falsely be tell be unacceptable

It really matter to me to see humanity a progressing  Things be not a I might wish  but I do think they be get well  A little group of Quakers  frighten of Peak Oil  climate change  and the Global Financial Crisis have a conversation where I assert this  and people bring forward the Bosnian war and the Rwandan genocide  child labour in India  even female genital mutilation  forsooth  a evidence against  I could play the game  I have a good level of articulacy and rhetorical skill  I be interested in current affair and history and Life  in all it fulness and variety  even if more a an observer than a participant  so far so I can come up with apposite example and elegant argument  Instead  I disengage  Heaven be Here  I see it  That anyone do not see it be not evidence against it existence  So  I do not need to win the argument and convince anyone  I be satisfy in my own mind  I can say to anyone  look around yourself  See the abundance and the beauty and the wonder and the Blessing  Look  at this  or this  or this  And if they can not take this in  I may give up on them  Gosh  that be pretty mature of me  Saintly  even  Or  since I be do teenage at the moment  the

Am I bore you  Am I just repeat myself  I have be think about that last Pronouns conversation  three week ago  There be time when it be the other \u2019 s own stuff come out  or they be just ignorant  and there be time when they want to push my button  Those two  they know  they have the intelligence  maturity and experience to understand completely  That particular time  it be deliberate  As if I have a big  red button  as big a my torso  and all you have to do be tap it gently and watch me implode  I HAVE NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF  Ah  Breathe it in  I be get there  I have nothing to be

I visit Belfast in 1988  There be soldier with gun  and armour van with low skirt on  so noone could roll a grenade underneath  and barb wire protect the pub  I be push my bicycle through the station  That army officer will not walk in front of me so I hurry  walk in front of him  make him pause  And I felt his Love reach out and envelop me  That be the only way I can put it  Rather than suppress it  I be feel the intense pain of decade of feel that I be an outsider  that I be less  and I see a way through this  TED  in praise of vulnerability  0000000 0000000 ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013
