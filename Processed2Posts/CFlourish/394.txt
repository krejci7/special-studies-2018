"text": "Heather BrunskellEvans refuse to refer to Caitlyn Jenner a anything other than \u201c Bruce \u201d or \u201c he \u201d  I don \u2019 t find her article give the reason  Heather quote Brendan O \u2019 Neill \u2019 s Spectator article  Do radical feminist ally with reactionary conservative on any issue other than trans politics  She write  I suggest a more effective catalyst for progressive social change be the following  firstly  unpack some of the conceptual term that GLAAD use to direct our response not only to Jenner but to transgender people in general  secondly  move beyond the neoliberal language of personal choice  voluntarism  and individualism  and return to analysis of the social context out of which our gender identity and choice emerge  thirdly  problematize Jenner \u2019 s inner woman a a simulacrum  BrunskellEvans confuses Caitlyn the person with Caitlyn the product  part of the Kardashian TV franchise and now Vanity Fair cover girl  By middle age most people have see through the woman \u2019 s magazine fantasy  The magazine tell u we only have to read them and do the simple thing they recommend  and we will be beautiful  with gorgeous fashionable clothes and makeup  a bikini body  and wonderful dinnerparty skill  good in bed and forge ahead in our career with all our anxiety cure  though instead they increase those anxiety  With it state of the art photography and computer processing  Vanity Fair might make even me beautiful enough to be their cover girl  with an almost recognisable photograph  I would do it  too  It would expose the fantasy a a joke  perhaps Caitlyn \u2019 s appearance already have  But I be not go to be on that cover  any more than Heather BrunskellEvans be  The product  on TV or in magazine  be indeed utterly conventional and normative  It conform to the perspective of the male gaze and the consumerist neoliberal ideal of the \u2018 authentic \u2019 woman that be in reality no more than a sexist and patriarchal simulacrum  The person behind the product  Caitlyn herself  be unknown  Vanity Fair photoshops everyone  Every Kardashian  every cover model  be a simulacrum  oppressively normative of the fantasy police woman  not just Caitlyn  Why should Heather pick on the trans woman  Hyperfemininity be empowerment for me  because I be hyperfeminine  This mode of expression free me to be my real self before other people  Such a mask might be torture for Heather  I don \u2019 t express myself a hyperfeminine to oppress her  but to free myself  I hope that my freedom increase hers  to express whatever combination of masculine feminine or genderless behaviour she judge either advance her interest or be most comfortable for her  That reactionary conservative opposes Caitlyn \u2019 s acceptance because he wish to reinforce gender norm  So Caitlyn \u2019 s expression be profoundly subversive  could the radical feminist but see that  When pretend to be male  Caitlyn \u2019 s and my seemingly voluntary and repeat performative iteration of our femininity or masculinity from childhood onwards be stereotypically masculine  Our feminine expression be choose to good fit ourselves  All trans woman will benefit from Caitlyn \u2019 s acceptance  we will suffer less ignorance and rejection of our subversion of gender norm  now we be support by such powerful cultural icon  But only one of u have condone Vanity Fail \u2019 s oppression of woman  by appear a cover girl  not all of u  and we suffer from the beauty myth particularly cruelly because most of u fall so short of the magazine \u2019 s ideal  Perhaps Heather BrunskellEvans \u2019 s article be cut  I see no analysis of the social context out of which our gender identity and choice emerge  so here be mine  Disney princess culture force girls towards a stereotypically feminine ideal  but increasingly they follow other path and enter high education and the profession  There be alternative culture  And I do not feel capitalism value my feminine gift  Now I have liberate myself from my oppressive socialisation into masculinity  and shed my internalised femmephobia and transphobia  I express a natural femininity through my increasingly diverse culture  I find this be easy for young people  gay and trans folk come out young  woman have a more diverse range of expression at work and play  Not all woman be force to femininity  some be force by circumstance to be uncomfortably masculine  We all have shadow to liberate  incongruity between selfconcept and organismic self  Kyriarchy be more various than the concept of \u201c patriarchy \u201d would admit  Finally  I be proof of the reality of gendered identity  Were I not  I would be a I be socialise to be  a normal man  I be unsure how often corset appear on VF cover girl  but here be one I find equally problematic  Among the Fresh Faces of 2008  the white lady be wear dresses show off their sexual fitness  but able to pretend to respectability and the black woman be in a corset  act great sexual availability  VF allow people of colour and trannies onto their cover  but not on the same term a  well  lady and real woman  ", "feedtitle":
