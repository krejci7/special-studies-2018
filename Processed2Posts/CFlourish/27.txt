trans man  Trans right be a feminist issue  Trans people advance feminist concern  I spend half an hour last night on Youtube watch a feminist attack trans right on feminist ground  She tell of the opposition to the woman \u2019 s suffrage movement a century ago  by woman as well a men  base on the idea that woman be different and would not have the objectivity to judge the interest of the public sphere  She have be hold back by this persist idea of difference  which be the heart of woman \u2019 s oppression  and which she say \u201c trans ideology \u201d actively enshrine  That might be true if trans be static  one way of be trans be the only way  But trans people be creative  find new way of be ourselves in our own space  in performance writing and entertainment  and in ordinary life in the world  Trans be a force undermining that idea of difference between sex and promote the truth of the variation within the sex which increase the freedom of everyone  I want to relate to others a myself  with minimal pretence to comply to gender norm  This be easy after transition  I try to \u201c make a man \u201d of myself  with a restrictive idea of how a man should be  Expressing myself a a woman free me  If it be indeed see a leap a chasm  become something utterly different  that would be conservative  enshrine difference  When the doctor get hold of the idea of trans  take it out of our own subculture  they produce a medicalised idea of transition  involve hair removal  genital alteration and hormone treatment  to create a person who would look like a man  or look like a woman  undress as well a clothe  The idea that I be really a woman  with a woman \u2019 s brain  spirit or character  which this feminist find so oppressive because it mean there be a difference between men and woman beyond our reproductive function  free me to transition  Thousands of u  rather than ten of thousand in Scotland where she be speak and which propose alter the law  might be free from a conception of their gender which they find oppressive  yet they can not change without this drastic step by allow transition  Out of 53m people  ten thousand would be 02   a large number actually to transition  The idea of a transsexual person free me to transition  but even a I do I realise there be two question  Am I transsexual  Will I be happy if I transition  The second be more important  First the ideology  then the idea free me to express my gender by teach me that it be possible  So individual and society together produce formalised route for transition and recognition  Trans people become more visible  vocal and encourage  and empower to do something about the restriction of their gender rather than live fearful  stultified life or end them  As we become empowered  we critique the medicalised concept of transition  Do we really need genital surgery  Should someone necessarily be sterilise before their gender be recognise  No  we say  Do we need to live in stealth  where people think we be bear  wo  men  No  because that be in fear of transphobic violence it may be prudent sometimes but it oppress u with an impossible ideal of beauty  Gender cease to be a choice of two  almost entirely align with physical sex  and become a palette of possibility  It be happening here  now  in Scotland and beyond  with people who would never think of themselves a trans but also with trans people  blur the line and increase freedom  Eventually the two group will meet  a spectrum of gender rather than a division between those selfidentified a trans or nottrans  The increase complexity of idea such a genderqueer and nonbinary accelerate this change  Femininity be oppressive when people be judge a less because of their natural unfeminineness  Then femininity can seem merely oppressive  a tool to oppress woman  Trans show that femininity freely choose be a source of strength and selfactualisation  valuable in it own right for AFAB as well a AMAB  I see trans men choose what I reject  and so be enabled to see value in it  That feminist on the video  want to say \u201c NO \u201d to a trans woman enter a woman \u2019 s bathroom  and get a loud cheer for reject the idea that woman must always put others \u2019 feeling before their own  paradoxically aid the conservative by restrict trans people to a narrow  absolute concept of transition  She oppose the law be more liberal  and discern a loosening of the concept of a \u201c sex change \u201d  though in Scotland the proposal would still require u to swear we would live in the other gender life long  Allowed to grow freely  the trans movement would increase the range of gender expression and freedom  Trans be a feminist movement  promote the freedom of all  include cis woman who do not conform to the cultural stereotype of femininity  include that woman who rail against it  Many cis woman support trans right  As Margaret Atwood say  A war among woman  a oppose to a war on woman  be always please to those who do not wish woman well  Women strongly oppose to trans right should consider whether any of the wrong they rail against have any realistic chance of happen  ", "feedtitle":
