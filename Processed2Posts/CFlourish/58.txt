\u201c gay cure \u201d it be clear that mean attempt to make a gay person attract to the opposite sex or not attract to their own sex  but what do it mean for trans folk  We selfdiagnose  Noone go to a doctor with a set of symptom and be surprise to be tell they have gender dysphoria  if you know of anyone  please tell me  We have contact people in the community and reach an understanding of what we want  Possibly we have get hormone off the internet  or already transition  Gay identity can be liberate  Battered down by the homophobia pervade society  a person can actualise their fully function human identity by therapy  accept their attraction  use them to build relationship and community  and get sexual release without shame  The whole person be good  right and acceptable  Selfacceptance empowers them to fulfil their goal and share their gift in society  Trans identity come from a feeling of not fit  not be congruent  My be  my personality  character  real me  inner self  conflict and oppress through internalise transphobia  be nevertheless right and beautiful and can be liberate by good psychotherapy work with my intense desire to know the truth  my human capacity for growth and healing  and my Love  But that miss out my body  Bodies be embarrass  We cover them with clothes  not just for warmth  They do embarrass thing like belch  fart  excrete  menstruate  They get sore and tired  We want them to be other than they be  so diet and exercise to change them  rather than for the joy of it  Encouraged by the culture  we imagine an ideal body and always feel we fall short of it  My body be beautiful  My body be acceptable  My body be full of potential  I can develop it  but should be careful when I imagine I should constrain it  and only do that for good reason  Here be Walt Whitman  section 20 of Song of Myself  worth glorying in for it shock Acceptance  I find no sweeter fat than stick to my own bone  In all people I see myself  none more and not one a barleycorn le  And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them  I know I be solid and sound  To me the converge object of the universe perpetually flow  All be write to me  and I must get what the writing mean  I know I be deathless  I know this orbit of mine can not be sweep by a carpenter \u2019 s compass  I know I shall not pass like a child \u2019 s carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night  I know I be august  I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood  I see that the elementary law never apologize   I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by  after all   I exist a I be  that be enough  If no other in the world be aware I sit content  And if each and all be aware I sit content  One world be aware and by far the large to me  and that be my self  And whether I come to my own today or in ten thousand or ten million year  I can cheerfully take it now  or with equal cheerfulness I can wait  My foothold be tenon \u2019 d and mortis \u2019 d in granite  I laugh at what you call dissolution  And I know the amplitude of time  Is that not glorious  Read it again  breathe  glory in it  This this creature  body  mind  spirit  brain  thews and sinew  quest intelligence  empathy  Love be completely and entirely beautiful  My body be beautiful  I only realise my body be beautiful after transition  My arm be beautiful  round  long and slim and strong enough  with a lovely  dextrous hand  and before transition I saw it a thin  weak and unmanly  Something do not fit  What be it  There be three alternative  The soft  gentle  empathetic spirit The body  with penis and testicle  precisely the size it be The cultural understanding that a man should be like this and a woman should be like that  We take into ourselves that cultural concept  First I try to make a man of myself  to fit that concept  and then when I begin to accept my spirit a it be I transition  so I could be that spiritself and at the same time conform to the cultural understanding  My presentation  a a man  dress a a man  do not fit  so I change it  my body  with a man \u2019 s facial and body hair  penis and testicle  do not fit  so I change that too  The NHS want to end conversion therapy  but what would prevent conversion therapy look like  when the culture do such a brilliant job of convince u that we be wrong  inadequate  not a we ought to be  It give u two course  both of which involve convert u to fit in  make a man of yourself  or alter your body and express female  We start therapy convert  not accept ourselves  Therapy address the mind  and help u accept our spirit  but do not address the cultural rejection of the body  Unless therapist take into account the conversion wrought by the culture  and oppose it  they be complicit with it  All of me be acceptable  just a it be  body as well a spirit  The problem for me be that I don \u2019 t know if I could convince my 35 year old self  commit to transition  believe that be the way to accept and liberate my feminine self  and to give a clear impression of who I be so that others can interact comfortably with me and I with them  Clothes be so much of how you signal who you be  I always know that I might be try to live a a man five year after  but I have to get there via transition  To accept my spirit  I have to transition  and spend year on it  I could accept my body if I saw it a female  I still best get a handle on my personality if I conceptualise it a \u201c feminine \u201d  To accept my spirit and body together without transition might have be too much for me  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 6 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
