Scottish Government propose that a person should get gender recognition  if they make a formal declaration before a Notary Public that they intend to live in their acquired gender until death  Making a false statutory declaration be a criminal offence  and their research on other country allow selfdeclaration have not find evidence of false or frivolous statement  There be support from woman \u2019 s right organisation include Scottish Women \u2019 s Aid and Rape Crisis Scotland  whose joint statement say  We do not regard trans equality and woman \u2019 s equality to be in competition or contradiction with each other  We support the Equal Recognition campaign and welcome the reform of the Gender Recognition Act  Rape Crisis and Women \u2019 s Aid in Scotland provide trans inclusive service on the basis of self identification  We will continue to work collaboratively with Scottish Trans Alliance and other equality organisation with the aim of ensure that new process be appropriately design and without unintended consequence  Limiting the number of time one can change sex might restrict frivolous application  Malta require second and subsequent application to be consider by a court  However Sam Kane have transition three time  male to female to male to female  and I feel each time she do it feel distress and oppression  She revert because of sexism and transphobia  These thing be not her fault and she should not be penalise for them  Colombia only permit two change  which must be at least ten year apart  That might make me fear an honest declaration  since I can not correct it if I be wrong  When I transition  I think it possible that I might be try to live male five year later  It be an additional difficulty  just one more thing require a leap of faith  I consider my real transition to be the day I transition at work  or \u201c go full time \u201d  which require enough clarity  determination and trust  a I would have make a fool of myself to revert  Even the suggestion that men might do this frivolously  or maliciously to get access to woman \u2019 s space  be repulsive  Even three in a year might be a leap  a bad experience cause reversion  then a second leap of faith which be even more courageous  I do not want someone show that courage and determination to be investigate in case they be frivolous  Instead  deal with actual wrong  Women \u2019 s space be not a good place for sex crime  a the criminal be outnumber  Women \u2019 s support group have experience with difficult behaviour and way of deal with it  The Scottish Government propose that 16 year old should be able to affirm their gender change  a Scots law generally give right a adult to people over 16  and protection a young people until 18  They be consult on various option for young child  such a allow parent to affirm for them  The parent would be trust to do this in the best interest of the child  and consider the child \u2019 s wish  Alternatively  a child who could show they have sufficient maturity to make the decision could affirm  Ireland and Denmark do not require the consent of a spouse before a married trans person can declare their gender  If the gender change break the relationship  the trans person should not have to undergo the expense of divorce before get their gender recognise  If the relationship remain  the trans person will not make the declaration without their partner \u2019 s support  In either case they should not require the partner \u2019 s consent  Consent can be use to put improper pressure on a trans person  The other may feel betrayed  and feel that the trans person have break the relationship  but that do not entitle them to take revenge by refuse consent  Now  if one partner seek gender recognition the other can use that a ground for divorce  This should not be a separate ground for divorce  The usual ground be \u201c unreasonable behaviour \u201d  and a spouse should be able to argue that gender change be unreasonable behaviour  This be such a slight change  it mean that gender recognition break the marriage in the particular circumstance of this couple  rather than normally or generally  They be also talk of increase recognition for nonbinary people  though this will require action by the UK government and additional right in Equalities legislation  They don \u2019 t address the question of what it mean to \u201c live in your acquired gender \u201d  For me  do it mean always wear wig and at least attempt to talk in a feminine register  Does it mean anything else about clothing preference  or particular behaviour  I think it mean what the person believe it to mean  Women can wear what they like and do what they like  I feel most people who change gender will have a particular view about what it mean  and attempt to resemble the assigned gender  but that be subjective too  Consultation document pdf be here  It describe way to respond to the consultation  ",
