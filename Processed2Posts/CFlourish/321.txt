bisexual  despite be marry with child  but lesbian  She be still live with her husband  only out of convenience  Then she go back to him  and I have not see her again  but hear her embarrassment  she have tell me that  and after our friendship would be different  At another occasion H get out her quaich  and the whole group drink together  and she be delighted when I tell her she have make me feel more Scots than I have for a long time  My friend \u2019 s wise husband  who wish me well  observe that when I would say something important I would digress into some long story  Oh  dive in  This lead to that  and there  and there  and your project academic study of Transsexualism will take a similar line if you ever write it  and it be you I want to convince  and I know I can not  because you too see the oppression of human female and loathe it  I be free to be myself by my transition  It be so much good  And you would tell me that be a partial liberation at a terrible cost  overseen administer enforce by patriarchy  which contribute to the patriarchal system of lie  and so the oppression of others  The case for that  One be not bear  but rather becomes  a woman  No biological  psychological  or economic fate determine the figure that the human female present in society  it be civilization a a whole that produce this creature  intermediate between male and eunuch  which be describe a feminine  So say Simone de Beauvoir  It be not true that woman think emotionally  men rationally  Women may think rationally  Women be force by cultural conditioning into be submissive  dependent  emotional  receptive  intuitive  timid  passive  sensitive bonsai come to mind when if allow to develop and mature without such conditioning they might be rational  etc  The conditioning be not as severe a it be  in some area  The amount of woman  under 40  who have good career in traditional male field \u2013 aeronautics  accountancy  engineering  civil eng  architecture  for example  be amaze  It be still notice  not normal enough to be unremarkable  but it be happen  Part of the pain I be feel right now be that I think emotionally  and I really need that to be value  It be beautiful  It be  \u2665\u2665\u2665 You see  transition be liberation  I could be me  It terrify me completely  There we be at the Sibyls in our evening gown  at three in the morning  surround by wine bottle  and the conversation a it always be  Should we  Could we make a go of it  Could we possibly avoid it  I decide I have to transition  in June 2000  Then I go to the Northern Concord and join the transsexual  and decide I could not  They have such awful  restricted life  no job  little social life  God  that \u2019 s ironic  that be how I be now  and I decide I could not  But then at the Sibyls I meet woman who be survive well enough  and I know I have to try  I think my employer would find an excuse to dismiss me  and I still have to try  My first speech therapist tell me I should not practise her exercise for half an hour at a time  but in spare moments walk up the stair in the office  for example  So I would glissando down from my high countertenor point  to just above the break  to find my ideal pitch  and then I would go to my desk  It mess with my head completely  At the time  I would express myself female at the weekend  go to the Quaker meeting and MCC  and then revert to present male on Monday morning  That Monday feeling  square  I be not easy to be with  Liberation  then put the legirons on again  But with this speech exercise  I would be me on the stair  and revert on get back to my desk  several time a day  I could not bear it  I wake at 4am thinking of Vicky  with her MS never in remission  in a wheelchair and dying  and I envy her  I would have swap place with her  I have tell these story before  here  I tell them again because I be back in that confusion  I feel the hostility  Possibly I should not go there  but  well  I love you and so I be commit  And your kind reasonableness in challenge the authenticity of my change be bad than ridicule  You might say  I never want to be a woman at all  just perhaps feminine  which except a a Patriarchal construct have no link to woman \u2019 s potential separately from that construct  I be proof that male can be feminine  I should not put word in your mouth  I be try to understand  \u2665\u2665\u2665 The way I saw to be myself be to express myself female  I change my name  wear woman \u2019 s clothes  have my ear pierce  wear a wig a my hair be so thin  Well  Patriarchal view of Manliness fit men as badly a femininity fit woman  a Wxhluyp keep assert  It come a a package  I spend four hour a week undergoing electrolysis  which be particularly painful on the upper lip  because I need to pass  I take synthetic oestrogen  and goserelin to suppress testosterone  for the same reason  I be still abuse in the street  In the Quaker meeting I repeatedly break down weep  I curl up on the floor in my bathroom  weep  repeat  \u201c I be not a man \u201d  Would think emotionally but present male really have be so much more difficult  Was it merely that I do not conceive of the possibility  However  surgery be not necessary to pass  There be a simple technique  call \u201c tuck \u201d  push the testicle back up the inguinal canal whence they descend at puberty  fold the penis back between the leg  hold it back with surgical tape or tight knickers  and behold no large a bump than the average mon veneris  I could have pass well enough in tight jean  even a swimming costume  leave alone the feminine full skirt I wear  I do  for nearly two year  Yet I want the surgery  I get more and more depressed  then have it  and be not depressed any more  Steps towards it delight me  Setbacks make me despair  I have the identity I crave  but it be not enough  So I say that want surgery be who I be  I could not be manipulate into it  however strong the pressure  I find cut off my little toe an appalling prospect  \u2665\u2665\u2665 You have make your way  despite patriarchy  You think a you  not a some feminine construct  More and more people do  Why should not I  Why should I not be authentically me  a a human be  rather than a victim of patriarchal lie  The mutilation be appal  Removal of gonad be a monstrous thing to do to almost everyone apart from the few of u for whom it be simply right  Weirdward  link above  show how woman who love and have physical relationship with woman can still reject the label \u201c lesbian \u201d a if be lesbian be somehow less  \u201c marrying and have child \u201d well  even for those woman who feel natural attraction to woman  They imbibe that falsehood from patriarchy  She find Simone de Beauvoir clear and relevant on how woman be force into \u201c femininity \u201d  but wrong  parrot old false idea about lesbian  Some  de Beauvoir thought  would have physiological difference  A female of vigorous  aggressive  exuberant vitality prefers to exert herself actively and commonly spurn passivity  illfavoured  malformed  a woman may try to compensate for her inferiority by assume virile quality  if her erotic sensitivity be underdeveloped  she do not desire masculine caress  Weirdward draw comparison between this and modern trans theory  She assert her own validity beautifully  yet deny mine  Of course it be part of ordinary human diversity  natural and right  that some woman be lesbian  Of course force them into the procrustean bed of heterosexuality  leave alone the whole patriarchal construct of femininity  be wrongful  Let u all be ourselves  Except trans woman  \u2665\u2665\u2665 Whether I should be allow into \u201c woman \u2019 s space \u201d be a separate argument  Whether de Beauvoir \u2019 s word on lesbian be useful trans theory  also  we observe people like me  why need any explanation how I get this way at all  Not \u201c because patriarchy \u201d but \u201c because humanity \u201d  human being be wonderfully diverse and strange  and people with testicle have be dress a woman for thousand of year  The heart have reason reason know not of  There be my desire for physical alteration  It simply be  it be the most important thing in my life  besides which nothing matter  I feel my desire harm noone  so why ever not  But then  I do think emotionally  To really understand
