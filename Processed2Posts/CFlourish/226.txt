"tags": ["trans", "performing"], "text": "This be what I say  My name be Abigail  and I be ridiculous  I have always be ridiculous  I grow up think that be a bad thing  and I should be sensible instead  I want to be sensible  I want to be normal  I want to fit in and I can \u2019 t  And now at the age of fifty I be come to accept that  I want the law change so I can get \u201c ridiculous \u201d write on my birth certificate  Everyone be in a constant struggle between Being themself and fit in  and word can trap and constrain u  and word can liberate u  My friend say that full skirt like this be Out of Fashion this year  and I don \u2019 t care  I love this dress  It \u2019 s bright  and extrovert  and joyous  Words can liberate u  The word \u201c trans \u201d liberate me  I be feminine  and I grow up know that be a very bad thing indeed  weak  sick  pervert  disgust  ridiculous  illusory  I get tell \u201c big boy don \u2019 t cry \u201d by the age of four  perhaps young  I know I have to Be a Man  and so I fight very hard to make a man of myself  Many trans woman do  We take manly job like the armed force  I know one who be in the police firearm unit  She have never shoot anyone  but she have point her gun at people  ready to shoot if necessary  We be not alone in this  Too many people be still tell \u201c Big boys don \u2019 t cry \u201d  and grow up unable to trust or express their emotion  Lots of people who be not trans  who be very happy be men or woman be shove into a constrain man box or woman box  with a particular set of expectation which do not fit them  Gender norms are ridiculous  In a bad way  Everyone have gender norm which they fit  others which they more or less go along with  and some which they resist  which be inimical to them  Gender norm be constrain  My free gendered way of be be a gift  It be a beautiful thing  This human diversity enriches society  and enriches every one of u  if we can let it flourish  It can enrich the church  The law at the moment accept a particular kind of trans person  If you  be of one sex  decide to transition to present exclusively a a member of the other sex  you will be protect by the Equality Act  If you be genderqueer or have some other gender you be not  I want to speak up for wide acceptance  I be a Quaker  I be a refugee from the Anglican Church  where I be baptise and where I attend almost every week until 2001  That be the time I decide I could no longer worship God disguise a a man  So I tell the vicar  who say  \u201c You mean you want to look like that  all the time  \u201d I do not look particularly female  I have shave rash and a bit of stubble under thick makeup  and a castoff wig  I dress unfashionably  with an underdeveloped sense of style  That meant I get spot  and insult in the street  \u201c It \u2019 s a fucking bloke  \u201d shout someone  There be a child in a shop  pull excitedly at Mummy \u2019 s hand and shouting  \u201c Mummy  Mummy  Look at the strange man  \u201d And there be a man who  a he pass me  whisper  \u201c Fucking nonce \u201d  I still can \u2019 t get that  He call me a nonce  a sex offender what make a man so hate someone he have never meet  The other thing the vicar say be that he would try to ensure I be not drive out of the church  As if I have this ridiculous whim  but he have to bear with me so that I could see for myself that it be wrong  though the rest of the congregation would object  So I go to the Quakers  Two Friends have take me to their meeting occasionally  and I think I might fit  A couple of year later  after go full time  I go back to that Anglican church to a wedding  and the welcome be warm and loving but some of the congregation would not speak to me  Being accept and value among Quakers  I can serve my meeting  I be Area Meeting Clerk for Northamptonshire it be sort of like be chair and secretary in business meeting  I want to contribute  I get to contribute  It please me  and it do good for the worshipping community  The Friends Homosexual Fellowship  now name QLGF  be the old gay Christian group in Britain  We have trans folk on our national committee  Everyone win  I want to speak up for other sexuality  The polyamorous people I know be Quakers  One be in an open marriage  She have have brief affair  with the consent of her husband  but be now begin what she feel will be a long term relationship with another woman  She be an elder  which mean she take part in pastoral care  I be not sure I could manage my own jealousy in such a situation  but I trust her judgment and her husband \u2019 s  to behave ethically  I need to speak up for Queer Hetero sexuality  We all know about this  but it be so rarely open  All the word for it be condemn  Queer Hetero sexuality be mock  The woman \u201c wear the trouser \u201d in a relationship  the man be \u201c pussy whip \u201d  and this be see a a bad thing  because Men should be Men  The woman be a harridan  termagant  virago  angry and bossy and unnatural and unfeminine  The man be effeminate  a pansy  I don \u2019 t know any positive word for this  \u201c Beta male \u201d  possibly  On the web  in the manosphere  you will hear that men should be dominant Alphas  and beta be second rate  My parent be like this  My mother be extremely control  My father be soft  and acknowledge this  call my mother \u201c The Boss \u201d  love it when she drive off in her district nurse uniform to sort people out  We could never admit it  I grow up know I have to Be a Man  which be nothing like that  I grow up have no clue what my feeling were \u201c I be perfectly calm \u201d  I be not aware of web community like this  On the internet there be dominant woman  in leather and pvc  whip men  tie them up or put them in cage  or \u201c sissifying \u201d them  put them in pink sateen miniskirted maid \u2019 s outfit  It all revolve around the man pay a woman to enact a fantasy humiliating him  Soft men be beautiful  Strong woman be beautiful  and we fit together  Yet we be ashamed  and we try to conform  A friend of mine have a soft boyfriend and want him to make a move  make it a relationship  and I think  but he want you to make the move  He want you to take control  really  One friend be a radical feminist  and she say most radfems be lesbian there be some mistrust of her  be hetero  My friend \u2019 s current girlfriend want him to be \u201c more manly \u201d  He have decide to try  he would put on an act  rather than behave spontaneously and freely  Another man I meet have quite a passive girlfriend and a hard manner  and when I meet him the second time he have dump her  and seem far gentle  as well a more relaxed and humorous  I be not sure how common it be  I grow up deny my softness  know it be weak  sick  pervert  disgust  ridiculous and illusory  and now I accept I be soft  gentle  peaceful and that be beautiful  And after we have all speak there be time for question  ",
