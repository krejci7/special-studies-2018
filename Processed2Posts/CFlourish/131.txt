three men in Oregon understood  but the White House doesn \u2019 t  be that in a healthy society  Islamophobia doesn \u2019 t disparage just Muslims  racism doesn \u2019 t demean black alone  misogyny hurt more than woman  xenophobia insult more than immigrant  Rather  we be all diminished  so we all have a stake in confront bigotry  \u201c Transphobia do not just hurt trans folk \u201d Why can \u2019 t Nicholas Kristof say that  Because it be too \u201c politically correct \u201d  Because noone really care about trans folk  because there be not enough of u to matter  because others would deny that and he can \u2019 t be bother to argue  Because he would deny it himself  He be write about the murder of Rick Best  who stand up for a Muslim woman against an Islamophobic rant on a Portland commuter train  Rick Best be a hero  I don \u2019 t impugn Rick Best by imagine he might not stick up for me in similar circumstance  but I wonder if New York Times editor and writer would  because there be a constant stream of such thing  They miss u out when write about disadvantage group  whom it besmirch civilisation when they be demean  but include u at other time  People have to choose between heat their home  buy food or buying health care and you want them to worry about the survival of the planet or transgender stuff  \u2026White life matter  too  you know  That woman forget that \u2014 and lose  We lose our discipline and our moral code in this country  So we need honest Trump to shake thing up  That \u2019 s Roger Cohen imagine Trump supporter  who later he call decent  thoughtful  anxious  patriotic Americans who felt they be lose some part of their country \u2019 s essence  I wish I believe Cohen think me as important a climate change  but I fear he just feel I repulse Trump voter as much a climate change realism do  This happen again and again  When the NYT need an example of Liberal ridiculousness or political correctness go mad  it pick on u  Opinion article devote to trans issue be generally positive  despite the possibly disconcert article \u201c My daughter be not transgender she \u2019 s a tomboy \u201c  but there be this steady drip of hostile reference  Send to know for whom the bell toll  it toll for thee\u2013 but  perhaps  not for trans folk  I have to add George Yancy  publish on 19 June  Is your God dead  He write we should be mortify by the inadequacy and superficiality of our anguish when we witness the suffering of others  the sort of anguish that should make u weep until our eye be red and swollen and bring sleepless night and agonizing day  He quote Abraham Joshua Heschel  \u201c Any god who be mine but not yours  any god concern with me but not with you  be an idol \u201d I continue to be haunt by the murder of an unarmed Trayvon Martin in 2012  Hundreds of thousand of child around the world be suffer  We all have know about the cruel and despicable violence toward transgender individual  We know about the magnitude of human trafficking  the magnitude of poverty  and the sickness of hatred\u2026 \u201c Through lamentation  voice be give to pain \u201d Yet our lamenting  our mourn for those who suffer  be far too shortlived  I need my lamenting to be hear  It be almost bearable  if I be heard  It be go on since Trump be elect  What be the most boring  irrelevant topic  According to Mark Lilla  it be transgender right  Fascination with the identity drama have even affect foreign reporting  which be in distressingly short supply  However interest it may be to read  say  about the fate of transgender people in Egypt  it contribute nothing to educate Americans about the powerful political and religious current that will determine Egypt \u2019 s future  and indirectly  our own  No major news outlet in Europe would think of adopt such a focus  Ongoing NYT watch  22 June  Brett Stephens  nominate more progressive candidate isn \u2019 t likely to solve the contempt problem  at least with voter not yet in sync with progressive orthodoxy on coal  gun or genderneutral bathroom  6 July  Mark Penn and Andrew Stein  \u2026workingclass voter saw the party be mire too often in political correctness  transgender bathroom issue and policy offer more help to undocumented immigrant than to the heartland  Credit where credit \u2019 s due Lindy West on the need to be unequivocally prochoice  2 August  I hear from some people on the left that Donald Trump \u2019 s victory be at least partially the fault of \u201c identity politics \u201d \u2014 of feminist push too hard  of Black Lives Matter be too aggressive  of trans people need to go to the bathroom \u2014 a though the violent suppression of a movement point more toward it irrelevance than it necessity  Lindy West regularly name u in a positive way  James Kirchick do not like Chelsea Manning \u2019 s leaking  even though it expose American crime  I find this sentence disgusting  But it \u2019 s hard to imagine Ms Manning receive such a positive reception \u2014 never mind a spread in Vogue \u2014 if she still identify a Bradley  transgender be the liberal cause du jour  Ms Manning \u2019 s atypical identity add a frisson of subversion to her already subversive act  Transgender  it would appear  trump treachery  I be not a \u201c cause du jour \u201d  I be a human be  A more subtle one  24 September  Americans have rarely disagree more in recent decade  We disagree about racial issue  bathroom policy  health care law  and  of course  the 45th president  It \u2019 s a list of serious matter affect the life of million  and in the middle be a nonissue affect the life of thousand  make scarily important and controversial by Bret Stephens  6 October  Roger Cohen say that after immigrant and \u201c
