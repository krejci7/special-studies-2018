pale  greygreen leaves but the one which please me most be this long  full silk skirt  It \u2019 s Monsoon  I love the feel of it on my leg and the way it move in the wind  the shape it make  It \u2019 s a bit of a turnon  actually  The lining be less full  end just above the knee  and if I stride too far it be a little restricting  I love this skirt  James Cantor coin the term \u201c Euphilia \u201d to mean sexual drive which unite two people  \u201c Sweetlove \u201d  Good  nice  normal  neatly include gay as well a straight  for Dr Cantor be gay  Then there \u2019 s paraphilia  \u201c besidelove \u201d  sexual stimulation from nonsexual cause  This be only a bad thing a \u201c disorder \u201d  if it cause distress to the subject or others no  I should not steal clothes from wash line  and too great shame about something which harm noone be unhealthy  All that shame have do me no good  Shame about what arouse me and what I desire have be the great pain of my transition journey  perhaps of my life  And here I be in the park  enjoy my skirt  I be not go to disturb walker whom I greet a we pass  You get arouse  Welcome to the human race  It \u2019 s so much good than be a panda  panda be die out  the drive need to be this strong to make people bring child up to adulthood  and be bind to have sideeffects  People be arouse a lot of the time  We don \u2019 t act on it but don \u2019 t need window into others \u2019 souls  I judge myself for everything  I should accept pleasure where I can find it  I fear everything  I should learn not everything be a threat  In my state of regret at the moment  wish I have retain my sexual organ  I recall how I felt  how express female be lovely  and present male go from dull to unpleasant to unbearable  I work hard to resist it  a we all do  I feel no shame at failure  There be no failure  the problem be the shame which make me resist  I would have be much higherfunctioning have I not have to deal with this war within myself for so long  It be a compulsion  and noone have the right to demand that you torture yourself by resist it  not even your wife  even if she do not know before marriage and you have young child  It be more than a sex thing  It be how I express who I be  all my beauty and creativity  but human be sexual animal  and transition be part of that  The craving for the operation come from the necessity of pass a a woman rather than the desire to transition  When I be consider transition  from 1998  when I transition at work  2002  and when I have the operation in 2004  in my milieu people be divide into transvestite  sexual pervert who be disgust or at least ridiculous  and transsexual who be woman  But nonop transsexual be dodgy  not really transsexual  probably something less  even if they say they could not have the operation because a heart complaint  Some of this be fear and internalise transphobia  We felt we could say  but I be transsexual  I have a medical condition  and the treatment be hormone and gender confirmation surgery  I be not like those pervert over there  That be how it be for me  It be much easy now to be trans and not have the op  and some people don \u2019 t  and people who do  do so because they have a need to feel comfortable in their own body  FM chest surgery be about how you be perceive by others as well a how you perceive yourself  but a penis may be tuck away out of sight  even in tight jean  I felt great shame  I be arouse by thinking of myself a female or femalebodied  and by clothes though not all the time  more and more they become just nice to wear  I be put off the thought of transition by the spectre of autogynephilia  I think I be a pervert  My wet dream be about crossdressing and I find that of all the shame the most shameful  I could not be arouse by another person  only my own fantasy  The Script increase the shame  Don \u2019 t tell the psychiatrist that  or you win \u2019 t get treatment  Tell him  yes  well  that you know there be something wrong age 2 and know that you be a girl age 5  Later  when I tell a psychiatrist I have no thought of crossdressing before age 14 and no thought of transition before my thirty  he say lot of people be like that  if they \u2019 re honest  Then I decide  transition be what I want more than anything else in the world  and why I want it do not matter  I have not have a satisfying emotional relationship  because I hide my real self behind my manly shell  I have not have a satisfy sexual relationship  I have some idea of what I be suppose to do in bed with another  but none of what I might like  and so I have the operation because of social pressure  That be what I understand I have to do  to be acceptable  I want to be accept in society  For that  the law say I must be propose to undergo  be undergo or have undergone a process  or part of a process  for the purpose of reassign the person \u2019 s sex by change physiological or other attribute of sex  Transition have enable me to be myself  It be the human condition to be stick between want to be onesself and want to fit in  and a we mature into middleage we work that out good  work out a reasonable compromise  or way round the most intrusive demand  And where I be  how I be  trap in that fake masculinity  complete rejection be the only way to go  It be not just  I be not a man like that  therefore I must be a woman  I fit cultural idea of femininity  Or  I don \u2019 t know  that \u2019 s whistle in the dark  possibly I just tell myself that because transition be good than try to man up by  say  join the territorial army  Whatever  At least  it be not completely that I be Unmanly  Untermensch  less than a Man  but different  and Good  worthwhile  and I have some similarity to cultural understanding of a woman  And  I be Clare  rather than generic either  At least transition have let me be more myself than I be before  There be the social pressure to fit this box mark Man  but the one mark Transsexual include gender confirmation surgery be more comfortable  It have be an essential part of my journey  It be what I want  more than anything else in the world  This blog explain what transsexuality be for me  This page be the gateway to it  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 22 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
