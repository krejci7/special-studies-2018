an academic  think he be a martyr because he insist on call trans woman \u201c he \u201d  Most people be in love with their particular life drama  Their story be their identity  The ego run their life  They have their whole sense of self invest in it  Eckhart Tolle It \u2019 s almost impossible to provide people with enough protection so that they feel safe to speak  OK  so we \u2019 ll address that directly  It be not safe to speak  It never will be  But the thing you \u2019 ve get to keep in mind be that it \u2019 s even less safe not to speak  It \u2019 s a balance of risk \u2014 do you want to pay the price for be who you be and state your mode of be in the world  or do you want to pay the price for be a bloody serf \u2014 one that \u2019 s enslave him or herself  Well that \u2019 s a major price  Man that thing unfolds over decade and you \u2019 ll just be a miserable worm at the end of about 20 year of that  No selfrespect  no power  no ability to voice your opinion  Nothing leave but resentment because everyone be against you because of course you \u2019 ve never stand up for yourself  Say what you think  Carefully pay attention to your word  It \u2019 s a price you want to pay if you be willing to believe that truth be the cornerstone of society  Jordan Peterson There be an \u201c I \u201d  It may not be nameable  so there be cataphatic and apophatic tradition in theology say what God be  or God be not  I be not just my story  my struggle  all the thing I have do and not do  always restrict by what I have not do before  I know I can speak Truth  when I say something I be completely certain of  I Know it  Saying such thing be different from simply give an opinion  Peterson say  say what you believe  however much you suffer for it  and one thing he \u201c suffer \u201d for be say I don \u2019 t recognize another person \u2019 s right to determine what pronouns I use to address them  I think they \u2019 re connect to an underground apparatus of radical leave political motivation  I think utter those word make me a tool of those motivation  And I \u2019 m go to try and be a tool of my own motivation as clearly a I can articulate them and not the mouthpiece of some murderous ideology  He get to say who I be  in his view  I don \u2019 t know whether he actually misgenders people  but he seem to think that if I say my name be Clare and my pronoun sheherhers  that be something he deign to grant out of his own generosity not something I claim a of right  In between u be reality  and the question whether I be a man or not  I say I be a woman  and if he call me a man he take from me my right to say who I be and be who I be  He say that whether he accept another \u2019 s view of reality be his choice  and I oppress him by demand my right to define even myself  Of course  he have a lot of fan who want to call me \u201c he \u201d and feel selfrighteous about it  They want to be nasty to me  even if he simply want to resist be force to be nice  He do not accept concept of privilege or oppression  The idea that woman be oppress throughout history be an appalling theory  Peterson and Brophy conclude that political correctness exists in two form  which they call PCEgalitarianism and PCAuthoritarianism  Simply put  PCEgalitarians be classic liberal who advocate for more democratic governance and equality  PCAuthoritarians be  accord to Brophy  \u201c the one now relabelled a social justice warriors \u201d Both share a high degree of compassion  Extreme compassion  they believe  can lead to difficulty assess right from wrong  It also can mean the forgiveness of all failure and transgression by people view a vulnerable  \u201c Any personality trait to an extreme be pathological  \u201d Brophy say  According to Peterson  in Scandinavia there be an intense attempt to flatten out cultural difference between the sex  and the biological personality difference be strong there  For example  woman be more agreeable  Gender be biological destiny  not social construct or performance  If gender be biological destiny  and I map onto those feminine personality trait  then I be a woman  rather than a man more comfortable presenting a a woman  Or  I be a diseased male  fail to live up to my destiny  The University of Toronto seem to try to wish it away  Sioban Nelson  the viceprovost of faculty and academic life  who seem weary of the subject\u2026 argue that the university have no problem balance it commitment to freedom of speech and it support for vulnerable group or minority view  It be not an eitheror situation  she say  Regarding Peterson specifically  she say  \u201c The university have make it very  very clear  and have be quote ad nauseam  that we do expect all member of our community  faculty or staff  to abide by the human right code and to be respectful and supportive of each other \u201d I feel that misgendering be not supportive  Either he get to define my gender  or I do  He make a virtue of be disagreeable  If you worry about hurt people \u2019 s feeling and disturb the social structure  you \u2019 re not go to put your idea forward  I disagree  There come a moment when I  though I always seek to be agreeable  stick my head above the parapet and say This be my truth  This be the thing I will not back down on  though all society deny it  This be the thing I will assert though the Heavens fall  That be a matter of integrity  not agreeableness  A disagreeable person might think himself Innovative  when he be merely contrarian  One thing about me that \u2019 s strange be that I will have impossibly difficult conversation with people  There be people who shy away from that  They let monster grow under their rug  Their marriage fall apart  They get detach from their child  They carry around resentment and unresolved conflict  I \u2019 m not do any of that  If there \u2019 s something to be discuss that \u2019 s difficult  we \u2019 re go to discuss that right down to the goddamned foundation  It be a good thing for me that when someone misgenders me I think he be a discourteous oaf  rather than that I be a pervert or whatever  I find Jordan Peterson \u2019 s insistence on Truth here  and the account of the result stooshie here  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 13 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
