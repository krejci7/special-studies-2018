go after death  but it be still a useful concept  Those who commit the sin against the Holy Spirit  though they live  be in Hell  The sin against the Holy Spirit be certainty  Mark 32830  Truly I tell you  people will be forgiven all their sin and all the blasphemy they utter  But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgive  but be guilty of an eternal sin  He say this because they  the Pharisees  be say  \u2018 He have an evil spirit \u2019  Jesus condemn the Pharisees in strong term  eg Matthew 2327  Woe to you  teacher of the law and Pharisees  you hypocrites  You be like whitewashed tomb  which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside be full of dead men \u2019 s bone and everything unclean  What be wrong with them  That they close their ear  eye  heart and mind to any challenge to their own beliefs Matthew 1315  quote Isaiah 610  they hardly hear with their ear  and they have close their eye  Otherwise they might see with their eye  hear with their ear  understand with their heart and turn  and I would heal them  Isaiah 6 be the call of the prophet  and his first message  Another possibility be that the person who do not hear with his ear be a person who refuse to empathise  even to try to see thing from another \u2019 s point of view  He have his own point of view  Noone else \u2019 s can have value for him  a if he can not hear it  John 8 3147 illustrate the problem in stark term  Jesus  The truth will set you free  33 They answer him  \u201c We be Abraham \u2019 s descendant and have never be slave of anyone  How can you say that we shall be set free  \u201d Because they believe they have the truth  because of their certainty  they can not listen to the truth Jesus speak  With God  all thing be possible  Matthew 1926   How  John 358  5 Jesus answer  \u201c Very truly I tell you  no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they be bear of water and the Spirit  6 Flesh give birth to flesh  but the Spirit give birth to spirit  7 You should not be surprise at my say  \u2018 You must be bear again \u2019 8 The wind blow wherever it please  You hear it sound  but you can not tell where it come from or where it be go  So it be with everyone bear of the Spirit \u201d But Jesus also say  Luke 1631  If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets  they will not be convince even if someone rise from the dead  An example may be useful  Young Earth creationism  Over the last century  a vast array of evidence have be amass for the theory of evolution by natural selection  and for the age of the Universe the current theory be that it be 137 billion year old  and have of the order of one hundred billion galaxy  This evidence be teach in university all around the world  continually debate  assess and theorise  If the Earth be really less than ten thousand year old  how may this be explain  Has God place false evidence to delude all those academic  Or be they all the slave of the Devil  conspire together to delude humanity  Christianity itself refute youngEarth creationism  Realising one be wrong be intensely painful  but it get easy  The cure for this sin be openness to truth

For those who have a desperate urge to learn what \u201c arsenokoitai \u201d might really mean  the post link to here be very useful  For most of u  just know that the Bible condemns homosexual act Christians would condemn if they be heterosexual use of enslaved prostitute  or gang rape in Sodom be enough  Unfortunately some Evangelical christian deny this  and say the Bible condemns all gay sex whatsoever  ignore the actual text  Behold  I stand at the door and knock  the knock the Evangelicals have to ignore get steadily louder  \u201c Sexual orientation be not a choice \u201c  say the Royal College of Psychiatrists  While look for evidence of Evangelical denial of truth  I come across this  We be willing to listen to evidence  we do not seek to stuff our conviction down people \u2019 s throat  but we do have certain conviction base on biblical principle  also bolster by pragmatic  sociological evidence  Not willing enough  some would say  a 5\u00b0 turn from the lie rather than the necessary 180\u00b0  but cautious ground for optimism  However   not recommend  if you really want an example of unreasoning hatred  of a man desperate to deny all truth  there be one here

The need to be open to truth  observation and evidence applies to me first  before I demand it of others  and in my websurfing I come across this report of a complete cure of gender dysphoria  A man have be prepare for transition  though he have not yet start the real life experience  and be in a therapy programme of which about 60  of the patient go on to have genital reconstruction surgery  After the removal of a female spirit  he pronounce himself cure  a happy heterosexual man  I think his powerful motivation to be \u201c cure \u201d be relevant  I love Mary and l \u2019 d have to give her up  Also  I find my career very rewarding and challenge  I would lose both if I have a sex change operation and become a woman  My wife refuse to live a marital life with another woman  and a it be  there be already great strain on our relationship because of my problem  My professional life would come to an end because there would be a paper trail  Anyway  who would take me seriously  despite my credential  All that I value would be lose in order to live my life a a female  Arguably  he have revert because of personal circumstance and the intense  destructive discrimination which he anticipate and which many of u do not  in fact  experience  The report do not state how he be now  many year later  How be I with evidence which do not fit my understanding  I be find the hole in it  of course  But I have email to ask if the Spirit Release Foundation have any followup of the case  I seek to be open to possibility  even those I find unattractive  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013
