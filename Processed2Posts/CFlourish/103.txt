righteous  I have right  I be rightly make  This be the world I evolve in  and I fit it  Now I can not understand the note I take  but it be something about be the cat which low status people choose to kick  I imagine that poor transphobe thinking  \u201c I may be go to prison but at least I \u2019 m not a pervert like that \u201d His attack come from his own need  because he can not see me a I be  only a he have be teach to see me  a a way of control any effeminacy in him  Because it be not about me  his attack need not affect me  I can let it go  All my emotion be Right  or Appropriate  They be not always comfortable  here I be move from appreciation to judgment comfortable only for the ego  not the real self   I trust what come up in myself  I trust what come up in the World  I do not have all the answer  but I have the ability to find them  It be whisky  newly distil  the first fire of it  Seeing my Godself be wonderful  and I need to learn to be comfortable in my new skin  I will reach a mature appreciation  different from this amazed delight  And it be True  I be Right  and I need merely appreciate that  That be two week ago  and I be build on it  It be at Yearly Meeting Gathering  the Experiment with Light  I saw myself a God make me  beautiful and Right  without the egoself which one create to try to survive  Now  since then  I be see that egoself more clearly  clutch it filthy rag about itself  and how poorly it serve me  Also at YMG be a Singalong showing of Frozen  \u201c How can she be see a some sort of Feminist icon  with those big eye and hair and princess dress  \u201d she ask  and I think  meet u half way  Those be not ideal  but see her characteristic which everyone else have see a a curse  accept it and reject their judgment  be strong and beautiful  It \u2019 s funny how some distance Makes everything seem small And the fear that once control me Can \u2019 t get to me at all It \u2019 s time to see what I can do To test the limit and break through No right  no wrong  no rule for me  I \u2019 m free  \u201c That perfect girl be go \u201d  how we be taught to idolise the egoself  which be never \u201c perfect \u201d  but enslave  She have some selfdoubt  want to do the right thing  willing to selfsacrifice rather than hurt  so inhibited from fight back  And  spoiler  the act of true love which save the young princess be not True Love \u2019 s Kiss by the Prince  who turn out to be a bad lot  but an act of bravely defend her sister  I love Top of the Lake China Girl  Episode 4 show how Puss  the egocentric  psychotic parasite  have enslave Mary  She love him  completely  He have first charm and flatter her  fool her into see him a an intellectual with an understanding of her parent \u2019 hypocrisy by mock them  he have convince her that the prostitute be somehow in the \u201c Real World \u201d which her parent avoid  so appeal to her teenage idealism  With mature adult he can only be a disgusting jester  his pretension see through  so he prey on a teenager  He reward her servility with kindness or kiss  a facsimile of Love  and a he have reel her in he give less and she  desperately  give more  I believe in his power to degrade her  She feel he be wise  teach her about life  and so tolerate be more and more humiliated  He say \u201c I be go to hit you in the face \u201d and do so  and such be his power that she almost accept even that  I hope with the fail blow job she have realise how poisonous he be  she need to reach rock bottom before realise that  because she now think herself a fool for be reel in by him  and few people could admit that to themselves easily  How happy I felt when you say my song be \u201c fantastic \u201d  And after  when you dismiss my verse  I only recite more  desperate to be affirm again  You be no psychopath  I love your bravery  intelligence  courage  fierceness  how you can feel such fear and do it anyway  Knowing you enrich me  I don \u2019 t think you reel me in  or have wrong me in any way  it be my own response to you  I felt it when I first saw you  so I would have to control how you walk into a room if I think you really have wrong me  and if I control you you would be nothing  rather than the glorious human be you be  You use me a a confidant  make me feel valued it be an exchange  I like to feel my listen reduces pain  And you will never meet me half way  Trans men  \u201c biological female  \u201d be victim  How awful that she felt she have to cut off her breast to escape the prison of femininity  Trans woman  biological male  be perverted exhibitionist  get a sexual thrill from fool others into thinking we be woman  So you say  I can not be a victim  only a perpetrator  for you  a a biological male  even though you claim toxic masculinity oppress all men  You loathe my performed femininity  that way I curve my hand  though none of this be conscious  To me  it seem it be just me  Still  I try to please you  I be continually surprise  How can you not appreciate me  Well  you don \u2019 t  The arrogance in me make me continually expect good  and my low selfesteem  the flip side of my arrogance  make me accept the taunt  Only see Mary weeping in her birthmother \u2019 s arm  surely have finally realise how damaging Puss be for her and what a fool she have be  or what a human she have be  so different from her conception of herself She weep and escape  I must follow her example  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 11 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
