should check our privilege  I have find arguable trans privilege  But first  a question  When do my country get so nasty  she ask  It \u2019 s be go that way for a long time since about 1979  That get a laugh of assent  How much we hate hear about \u201c Hard work family \u201d  it be corral the wagon  in defence against the Bad People outside  That UKIP poster be horrible  and the Tory one just a bad vote for u  and you can drug yourself into apathy tuppence cheaper  The woman at the bus stop be desperate to chat  As I sit on the perch  it creak and rock forward  and she say they should make those thing safe  you know  That be enough  a I be keen to chat too  She tell me of go to the convent in Lucknow  when her mother be a sergeantcook in the Army  just before India awoke to life and freedom   Her brother be at St Joseph \u2019 s  It be still go  but it be all Indian now  She know because it be a small world  she have be in Oxford have her brain tumour removed she turn her head  I gently felt the scar and she get chat to an Indian from Lucknow  He say he have be to St Joseph \u2019 s  She would not have believe him  a it be the sort of thing they would say  but he give sufficient detail  Then they come to Swanston  and where they live everyone be Indian  They \u2019 re all Polish now  she say  disappointedly  Though she be a foreigner  too  Her mother be Greek  \u201c She try to speak English as much a possible \u201d All this racial stereotyping \u201c These people \u201d be individual  who react in an idiosyncratic not a monolithic way get to me a bit  but I forebear from challenge  I be female now  I account it privilege that she want to start a conversation with me  On the bus a big bloke sit beside me  and tell me how cold the weather be  And it be so beautiful last week  What work do I do  Feeling no obligation to tell him the truth  I say I be an adviser  He use to drive a crane  but have not do that for year  He play in a six piece steel band  for wedding and all occasion  He give me a card  He would play for my wedding  Are you marry  Good look woman like you should have a fine choice of men  Do you often come into Swanston  Where do you live  He get off \u201c to go and see a friend \u201d  he explain  and kiss my hand  There you go  Trans privilege  I do not feel threatened more surprised than anything  though not particularly flatter  Perhaps  rather  it be size privilege  a any woman my height and weight would feel less bother than someone petite  Don \u2019 t tell the TERFs I say so  \u2665\u2665\u2665 A feminist \u2019 s perspective Then I make friend with a feminist academic  and have friendly  careful discussion about radical feminist theory  Do trans folk subvert patriarchal gender norm  or support them  In one case  she may be an ally  She believe there be trans privilege  and at first convince me  H be at a formal dinner  the guest of a trans woman  The trans woman be particularly glamorous  in pink silk dress  hair  makeup  nail all beautiful  perform Femininity square  H be vegetarian  and the staff repeatedly bring her meat  The trans woman perhaps should have take this up with the staff  a the hostess  but H felt she be behave in a somewhat masculine manner  in caretaking  As perhaps I be  when I insist on pay for the wine  Then the trans woman stand to address the assembled multitude  give a loud  extrovert  girlipink performance  like a drag queen  You may have do this yourself  It be risqu\u00e9  but only to an extent  It be a queer performance of gender which the culture have just about accept  Transwomen  on the whole  do not get slutshamed  H admit that I will have have shame and restriction a a child  but we do not have the experience age 12 or 13 of burgeon sexual feeling along with strong social message that they must not be act upon  Oh you can \u2019 t lie back You must stay cold at heart You must never let your feeling show For the moment you feel it might start Why then the only answer \u2019 s No  Girls must be modest  The man who sleep around be Jack the Lad  Do not disclose Lord Palmerston \u2019 s philandering  or everyone will vote for him  The woman who sleep around be a slut  H be with Green Party activist  who refer to a Conservative candidate a \u201c the town bike \u201d  That shock me  too  I would expect Greens to be sensitive to such thing  We be careful and courteous  I say I do not object to the word \u201c transsexual \u201d use a a noun  though some of u do  H be surprise that I be so revolt by the expression \u201c biological woman \u201d to mean ciswoman  It say I be not a woman  Well  maybe I be not  but the implication still hurt  In an ideal world  would people have The Operations  I explain how delighted I be to have my op  how horrified I be at the thought of lose my toe  and how I don \u2019 t think social pressure alone  strong a they be  would convince me to be castrate against the most basic survival instinct  I be not sure she accept this  Well  I grow this breast  and the thought of lose it horrify me as much a you but top surgery be right for trans men  She be an ally on the matter of autogynephilia  I explain James Cantor \u2018 s concept of euphilia  and the thought that MF transsexualism in gynephiles be perversion  and she say that she find that meaningless  The thought that there could be a \u201c perversion \u201d would mean that there be a \u201c normal \u201d to be pervert from  It have no relation to reality  I love the conversation  all four hour of it  I find her fascinating  A week later  I have very different view  First  she complain of that trans woman make a performance like a drag queen  It be an OTT performance of gender which be accept from trans woman but not real woman  To show how objectionable this be  noone would think of say \u201c She do that thing you black people do \u201d so why would anyone imagine that refer to clich\u00e9 trans behaviour be OK  And it be an Uncle Tom act  We behave in a way the ci straight expect  understand  and laugh at  I want to keep my option open  to do that  a more choice mean more freedom  but be unclear how to do it in power  And  yes  we don \u2019 t get slutshamed  but I be sham out of my sexuality  see it a disgusting  and not have word for it  so I have four girlfriend between 18 and 30  none at school  none last more than two month because I could not be myself with them  Worse  not within the protection of Feminine Virtue and Honour  we be see a available  Steve  who have some charm and intelligence but have go to seed  old and fat  drive me home from J \u2019 s U3A game morning  He say he find me attractive and ask if I would go to bed with him  At Oldham CAB  a dirty old man  poor  a miserable specimen  proposition our workexperience Asian girl  They have rebel against Asian modest dress  headscarves and all that  but have no idea how to dress a Westerners so come to work dress to party  He say their father in shame should throw them out  but he would take them in  and when he saw me about his income support  he touch up my bottom  Low status a he be  he imagine me a immediately sexually available to a path\u2026 Do you see me at all  Here be I  without a house  partner  child  saving  job  pension fund  anything  completely vulnerable  and you call me Privileged    J \u2019 s joky tale of Steve \u2019 s misadventure on the date scene  which he tell her to relieve his feeling and she tell me and her husband Pete for a laugh  rub it in  He take woman for coffee  because why take them for dinner when there will be only one fuck and who want to be stick with someone the whole evening  One say to him she would like him a a friend  and he expostulate that he have enough friend  He want a fuckbuddy  Why not advertise for that  Some people do  One woman basically say \u201c Here I am Take me \u201d Steve have a particularly unsuitable woman  Andrea  she \u2019 s alcoholic\u2026 \u2665\u2665\u2665 Privilege I clearly have With a shock  I realise  She \u2019 s working class  I have not notice until sit with J and another friend of hers in her kitchen  I find their conversation of little interest  Then J complain that some people resent her large house  think she have \u201c get above herself \u201d  She often comment that she and her husband have do so much of the work on the house themselves  that she have get furniture secondhand  that her  beautiful  clothes be from charity shop  Clearly some friend do not object  but the stifling pressure of fear be judge a \u201c get above yourself \u201d might prevent a person reach her potential  or traumatise her a she leave behind her social group  I have one particular privilege  it be expect that I would go to University  and my sister do not  initially  a our teacher my father saw that our IQ score be similar  though I have the edge  she want to be a nurse  not then a degree profession  and get her nursing degree in her 40 while hold down a job and care for a family  Though she be in rebellion against our parent in her teen  and peer pressure rather than parental expectation would have be more important  I remember write \u201c It be time to rebel against my parent \u201d in my diary  I be in my thirty  or at least late twenty  And work class boy be not expect to go to university  generally  by parent or peer  though an inspire teacher might drive them on  and one trans friend be  from her grammar school  It be not as simple a \u201c male privilege \u201d that boys have more education than girl  and in any case I have squander any advantage from my degree  and always earn less than my sister  whether because of a miasma of cissexism  or other psychological difficulty  Indeed I win \u2019 t get slutshamed  but my sexuality still frighten and confuse me  and be arguably immature a I have have little experience of adult sexual relationship  Here be a male privilege checklist  Despite the last  I have the privilege of be unaware of my male privilege  I don \u2019 t think the one relate to one current position apply  I get read  If I be not see a a weirdo  my fear of that be as restricting a the reality  I doubt be trans be ever an advantage in a job interview  \u201c If I complain to the person in charge  the person I see will be of my sex \u201d No  I be consider visit my new Tory MP  to confront him about some of his attitude  I will have power a my authentic feminine self and not otherwise  The problem here be the woman feel powerless  She have power if she only realise it  To me  the great trans privilege be my weirdness  Other people may muddle along  more or less  in conventional or fashionable way of be  because they fit well enough  I have have the great blessing of completely not fitting  so be force to find my True Self   Every cloud have a silver lining   My emotion overwhelm me the analogy I use  with bitter irony  be be premenstrual  It may be down to the hormone  I start them to feminize my appearance  not think they would so intensify my anger  fear and misery  But at the time  I be begin to get in touch with my feeling  and perhaps suppress then find be the cause  So \u201c We get medical treatment with unknown sideeffects \u201d  Not a privilege  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 40 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
