meaningful work  street I can walk down without fear  place I can go for help  way of participate in social life  As I be trans I may face hostility  prejudice and discrimination limit me  If I be out I will need lavatory  I do not assert a right to be in any of these space  It feel a if I be there on sufferance  on the toleration of other people which be never guarantee and may be withdraw at any time  I do not find another way of be  I try to make a man of myself  to fit cultural masculinity because it seem that otherwise I would be shun  Then I find the delight of be my true self in the gay village in Manchester  and it seem possible to be who I be a a trans woman  a a transsexual a I call it at the time  \u201c I be not a man  \u201d I weep  mean that cultural masculinity do not fit me  It never seem possible to live openly a a pansy  or soft male  I think soft men be gay  My father  who might have be my pansy role model  use the word a an insult  He be my role model in hide my softness away  I fit into the world a a \u201c trans woman \u201d  mostly suffer or tolerate with some mockery  misunderstanding  hostility  Even with the hostility it be well than present male  Society tolerate me in woman \u2019 s space  I use woman \u2019 s loo and change room  If gender neutral space clothes shop  toilet  shelters be to be carve out  a lot more people will have to identify a gender neutral than currently identify a trans  I be gender critical  Gender be cultural  and not somehow relate to evolve sex characteristic  After the Sex Disqualification  Removal  Act we see that woman can work a barrister and solicitor as well a men  and increasingly we see woman in STEM  Women can vote without go insane  contradict concern express before 1918  Gendered response be strongly condition in our society  enforce by most people from small child up  A man in a pink shirt be tell he would have to give up his \u201c man card \u201d  Gender be orthogonal to sex  ideally  Jung say men must discover their anima  or inner feminine  and woman their animus  and be right  but it be such a struggle achieve so late in life because of that conditioning  Mumsnet TERFs start pay attention to my blog  and I have have 186 click from there  hundred more page view  More people read such thread than comment on them  but the commentary on me be hostile  They judge me  I write on autogynephilia to show it can not exist  but my word be use a proof of it  I hope I might have persuade some who read without comment  but they be interested in trans issue and read TERF thread so it \u2019 s not certain  They say  It be an issue of men \u2019 s right not to be inconvenience  AGP actively impede the ability to empathize with woman  The issue be that I need space  I be exclude  and they seek to exclude me far  If I see distress or hostility  my instinct be to back away  to seek a workaround rather than to provoke  I be empathise  I be there  due to force I can not control  They doubt I be gender critical  be gender critical mean conceptualise gender a an external imposition  not a spiritual identity  I don \u2019 t understand how a MiT can call themselves a gender critical feminist\u2026 Without gender surely we remain with biology \u2013 a man be male and a woman be female  I observe that people have gender  just that it do not correlate with sex  It be part of human variation  I object to procrustean attempt to constrain gender expression  not gender expression itself  I observe that there be a great deal of unthinking enforcement of gender  and way to subvert it  trans and nonbinary  \u201c gendercritical feminist \u201d a an identity  build resistance  and attempt such a Natasha Devon \u2019 s challenge of stereotype  She be the former \u201c mental health tsar \u201d and speak to the Girls Schools Association conference she have platform  The comment on this thread show thoughtful support and mindless hostility  There be movement  How can gender stereotype be subvert from where we be now  Partly through visible trans folk  live out our radical rejection of the gender norm fit our birth sex  When I see gender neutral space  I will go there  One say  Not every male have a sexual motive for transition  ie  gay male want to sleep with straight men aka HSTS  third gender etc  straight male get off on feminine presentation aka AGP   There be some people with catastrophic body dysmorphia and some people who be genuinely in retreat from masculinity  But these people have nothing whatsoever to do with transactivism or transactivists and the reason we don \u2019 t hear from them be not that they \u2019 re the silent majority \u2013 it \u2019 s that the population be tiny than tiny  She understand that body dysmorphia and be unManly be motivation  but divide the motivation into discrete category  so that anyone who have ever be arouse can \u2019 t be in that \u201c tiny than tiny \u201d group  But noone will transition MF unless they feel themselves unManly   Tell me a good word \u201c effeminate \u201d really isn \u2019 t it   I be so sad that this have make me feel less compassion for trans people  I be sorry for them but I \u2019 m angry that their cause have be hijack by cross dress men\u2026 But I think I want to develop a \u2018 we don \u2019 t negotiate with terrorist \u2019 stance  The trouble be that we have make a zerosum game together  If she see the problem a men in woman \u2019 s space  I be in unwilling confrontation because I have nowhere else to go  The problem be  The Patriarchy  The problem be  gender conformity and gender enforcement  These problem we could attack together  but for the zerosum game  I manage to peak trans them  centreleft 30 something bloke  instantly with the sport issue  That be  Hannah Mouncey use masculine size compete against other woman  They be \u201c live and let live \u201d people  like anyone they don \u2019 t show hatred for minority easily  but she manage to make them hostile  and exults in this  Competitive female cyclist be far fast than I be  It isn \u2019 t relevant for most trans woman  Some people go to Mumsnet to radicalise themselves  then go out to radicalise others  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
