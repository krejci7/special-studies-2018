they matter too  and my friend be fair pleased to learn she be Klinefelter \u2019 s she have two X chromosome  But I be write for people who fit \u201c normal \u201d sexual development but not gender stereotype  and find this uncomfortable  The gender stereotype affect AFAB and AMAB differently  Women do most of the caring for child and dependent  most of the housework  get promote less  get interrupt more  The stereotype be rigid in childhood  enforce by toyshop and peer  Many people don \u2019 t conform to those  perhaps most  \u201c Patriarchy \u201d be the concept that society be configure in the interest of the dominant male  Depending on personality  some people be happy in their own skin and happy not to conform the boy who do ballet  the girl who play rugby  Some try to conform  until that become unbearable  There be a spectrum  so some only differ a little from the stereotype  some differ a lot  Some people be homosexual  some heterosexual  some bisexual  I don \u2019 t say \u201c gay \u201d and \u201c straight \u201d because  while there be men attract to men  \u201c gay \u201d be a particular way of conceptualise that  When you don \u2019 t conform  there be different idea on how you can conceptualise yourself and your relation to the wider society  include \u201c trans \u201d  \u201c nonbinary \u201d and \u201c gendernonconforming \u201d  Nonconforming AFABs be not merely soft  nonconforming AMABs be soft  so there be difference in how they respond  Radical feminist can be very angry  Each person be an individual  so noone precisely fit those box  the box be fuzzy enough to include different people  There be social pressure on the person who do not fit  to be trans  The wider society understand that  so if you be genderdiverse they may think you be trans and get confuse if you be not  A GP once tell me that one of the GP \u2019 s main task be to protect patient from specialist  who want to do stuff and surgeon have the brilliant idea of implant a womb in Lili Elbe  kill her by organ rejection  Surgeons busily remove womb and gonad  and alter the appearance of body  Many AMAB find dress a woman arouse  There be taboo against be visibly or discernably arouse in public and these extend to be crossdressed  Some people may have a physical sex dysphoria  and would want their organ alter even if there be no gender stereotype  We can \u2019 t know  However  transition provide a relatively comfortable place for some people  I be happier transition than I be before  and I realise  before  that even if in five year \u2019 time I be try to make a go of life present male again  transition be the route I have to take to get there  Because transition be a relatively comfortable place  I want transition  include physical alteration  to remain possible for people  I would also like people to feel accept in their assigned sex  a gender nonconforming a they wish  I feel both group be similar people with similar problem  and a similar interest in social acceptance of the wide possible gendered behaviour  for both gender  If I feel I want to do something which be particularly masculine I say \u201c Today I be nonbinary \u201d and do it  This be liberate  However  where there be social pressure to conform  the interest of each appear to be in opposition  Nontransitioners may feel pressure to transition  the \u201c acceptable \u201d way of be nonconforming  Transitioners may feel pressure not to  a transition be see a harmful by social conservative and radical feminist alike  I want both choice to be accept  but I take a side in the debate  Those who transition may see themselves a a class apart  really transsexual  AMABs who be really woman  AFABs who be really men  It be not a choice of a particular course of action  it be the choice to recognise and affirm rather than suppress who they really be  I say it be a choice  Yes  they really be naturally very far from the stereotype  but that do not mean they really be the other gender  I don \u2019 t accept theory of brain sex to justify transition  and idea of a feminine soul or twospirit be myth  story to say why transition feel comfortable  appropriate  or the most desirable thing in the world  rather than a rigorous scientific this therefore that hypothesis  If it be generally think that transition be a choice  it will be less acceptable  Scientific study be fraught  How many child detransition  Can you tell which trans kid will definitely want to transition a adult  and prevent their wrong puberty  People with a particular interest fight over the methodology and conclusion  Particularly  what should be the default when we don \u2019 t know  Why should it be that a trans child must undergo an assigned sex puberty  make transition later more difficult  Some people detransition because of social pressure  Society force them back in the closet  Some find a way to selfacceptance that do not involve present a the opposite sex  Yes  it be a choice  but a choice make by oppressed people between unattractive option  give that you don \u2019 t fit the stereotype  you can pretend to fit it  live openly not fit it  or transition  It be easy not to conform if you be comfortable in your own skin  but not everyone be  and people who face this choice often aren \u2019 t  Social Justice Warriors who want everyone to selfactualise  be value  and reach their full potential should be very careful what they say  Social conservative who value order and conformity should back the fuck off  ", "feedtitle":
