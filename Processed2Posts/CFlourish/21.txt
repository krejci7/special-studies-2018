slightly chubby leg  and say she have to wear extrawide boot to get round her calf  Mmm  I think  too late  of riposte  \u201c I love your bewbies  Mine take age to grow this big  Do you think I should have implant  \u201d Or  more selfdeprecatingly  \u201c Well  I have a man \u2019 s skeleton  It do not please me  particularly \u201d Then again  she might simply have be compliment me  She do not actually say \u201c I love your tranny legs \u201d  I be a little nervous at the start of the Labour Party regional woman \u2019 s conference  I be entitle to be there a my GRC say I be legally a woman  and some cis woman object to me in woman \u2019 s space  Just before get up  I have read on facebook of antitrans activist  campaign to have trans woman exclude from all woman shortlist with a crowdfunder raise \u00a320000  be suspend from the Labour Party  I drive there with D  whom I be get to know reasonably well  and like  and M  who recently join have leave the Tory Party and be eager to tell of the work she have do for Marsby a a district councillor  She want to do good for the town  and the Labour party be far more in tune with that  but she might be nervous have be Tory until last year  D and I be friendly and accept  Then Beth  the recently appoint candidate  tell me that she have hear from someone \u201c on the other side of your issue \u201d  She do not want to name it  We have be correspond through facebook  with most of the word from me  explain trans to her  and mostly positive comment from her  embarrass about ask basic question like what do the C in GRC stand for  I be in this hall fill with activist woman  worry that some might be TERF  Then I sit near a woman who have a shirt say \u201c A woman \u2019 s place be in the House of Commons \u201c  I felt more nervous  It be a common phrase  and need not be relate to the \u201c A Woman \u2019 s Place \u201d campaign against gender recognition  but that be what I think of  Yet the place we be in be a good place  The conference room be at the back of a building own by a church  with a coffee shop and food bank  On the wall  there be this  I love it  and others comment on it  I can \u2019 t find an exact source  but it be close to Isaiah 58  At the back of the stage there be a beautiful quilt  I go to have a close look  then see what it be and recoil in shock  it have 598 panel  one for each woman murder by a partner or former partner in the UK between 2009 and 2015  Oh  It be still very beautiful  and it bring to mind a horror  Later  the woman who conceive it  a Labour councillor  speaks of it  It be the Women \u2019 s Quilt  A man taught himself to sew so he could make panel for it  and call it \u201c the most beautiful project that should not exist \u201d  A woman say she have never felt sisterhood until she get involved  We need a memorial for these woman  I be glad to see it  I be happier speak to Neelam from Unite the Union \u2019 s LGBT section  This be more than small talk  I remain nervous  however when the actual talk start I be reassure  Karen Lee  MP  a former nurse  talk of woman \u2019 s representation  She be proud that she be build on the work do by Harriet Harman to make the House of Commons a more womanfriendly place  A bar have be convert into a cr\u00e8che  She be proud that 46 target seat have allwomen shortlist  and that include trans woman  Neelam  in the hustings for woman \u2019 s representative on the regional committee  one of whom must be from the BAME  Black  Asian and Minority Ethnic  community  talk of woman \u201c include trans woman who be face an incredibly difficult time \u201d  So I vote for her  obvs  Lilian Greenwood MP give the closing remark  She be delight by \u201c Cheryl  Nadia and Heather \u201d  three wonderful woman for a local allwomen shortlist  That be Dr Heather Peto  a trans woman  Lilian say \u201c Trans woman be woman \u201d and she be delighted that the NEC have just affirm that be Labour policy  \u201c Abuse do not belong in our party \u201d That bring forth cheer and applause  and I felt accept in that moment  and also felt the weight of my nervousness and experience of rejection  When I realise I be not only reject I become aware how painful the rejection  and the fear of it  be  Women need promote within the Labour Party  There be still rampant sexism  Someone quote \u201c What you say be inappropriate and I will not tolerate it \u201d because woman be socialise to not make a fuss and take care of others \u2019 feeling and you might need a set phrase prepare in order to mount a challenge  A black woman spoke of the abuse she have suffer when canvass for support a a local council candidate  \u201c Get that filthy N\u2014\u2014 off my doorstep \u201d  That be my problem  As a white person I must stand with those suffer pervasive racism  86  of welfare cut have fall on woman  and the charity Refuge have suffer 80  cut  155 woman a day be turn away from refuge  In a session on Increasing Women \u2019 s Representation a speaker  with The Times place on the table in front of her  say that she have campaign in the 1970s not for equality but woman \u2019 s liberation  from patriarchy and capitalism  Rich white men make the world to suit themselves  A feminised politics would have a wider perspective and be more inclusive  She ask contribution from the floor on why increase woman \u2019 s representation be a good thing mine be that there be talent not be use  but an old woman say we must be careful not to discriminate against the men  a if that be even close to become a problem  The chair of a local branch have resign from the party  and join the Tories  because they be require to nominate a man and a woman  rather than two men  for a shortlist for Parliamentary candidate selection  There be a working class narrative about men  with woman a an afterthought  Here be feminist  conscious of the oppression of woman  and angry about it  In the heat of the battle they face  I be justified be nervous about what they may think of trans woman  The fight can get nasty  And  I be accept  At the end  I be part of a photo of smile happy activist in front of that quilt   Someone texted it to me  and I can \u2019 t download it from my phone   That crowdfunder  seek to challenge trans woman on Labour woman only shortlist  they shoot themselves in the foot  They be suspend from the party  and what do they expect  Their transphobia be tolerate  but not their action against the party  Perhaps a a result  there be this interview of the leader  Andrew Marr  Is a trans woman a woman  Jeremy Corbyn  Yes Marr  So she can selfidentify  Corbyn  Yes  Women might complain in private  but not in my hearing  I be welcome in Labour  ", "feedtitle":
