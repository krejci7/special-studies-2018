fifteen year ago  and I don \u2019 t know why beyond it be what I want  more than anything else in the world  Noone know why  not really  in the ninety I hear about the bed nucleus of the Stria Terminalis central section  a bit of the brain which be twice the size in trans and nontrans men that it be in trans and nontrans woman  but there be no definitive research  I be a complex organism in a complex social structure be about as precise a I can get  I transition because I be human  I be I  So we tell story to each other about it  I don \u2019 t think the autogynephilia hypothesis be useful to explain or predict  but you might like it  I don \u2019 t know what be \u201c really \u201d a woman would mean  I know people have be do this for thousand of year  Deuteronomy would not prohibit something noone ever do  They be not \u201c trans people \u201d a understood now  but they be people see a men by the authority  wear woman \u2019 s clothes  There be people bear with testicle who believe they be woman  or third gender  all over the world  People transition in far less accept culture than ours  Socially and legally I be a woman  accept a a woman by such a Diva magazine and Women \u2019 s Aid Scotland  The former editor of Diva say  Thirty and forty year ago to be a lesbian be to be question  Today thing be much good for u  for the ci lesbian  that be  but there be still place where to be a lesbian be impossible  So it be for transmen and woman  many of whom have be or be lesbian or biidentified  We know something of these struggle  And just a others have support u  so we must support those among u who be trans or we risk end up on the wrong side of history  Unfortunately  that quote be no longer on their website  Scottish Women \u2019 s Aid and Rape Crisis Scotland say  We do not regard trans equality and woman \u2019 s equality to be in competition or contradiction with each other  We support the Equal Recognition campaign and welcome the reform of the Gender Recognition Act  Rape Crisis and Women \u2019 s Aid in Scotland provide trans inclusive service on the basis of self identification  We will continue to work collaboratively with Scottish Trans Alliance and other equality organisation with the aim of ensure that new process be appropriately design and without unintended consequence  So the trans lobby that afflict you be not a few dowdy  frighten trans woman but a huge number of campaign feminist  who be \u201c woman bear woman \u201d or whatever phrase you would like to use  When you campaign against the trans lobby  you be campaign against feminist organisation  Even if a few men in miniskirts with their penis show could terrify Women \u2019 s Aid by the threat of an Equality Act court action  they could not force them to make such a statement  Women \u2019 s Aid be use to assess the risk pose by client  and whether they should be in a group hostel or alone or send away because of lack of fund  And you be work with the establishment and the hard Right  the Telegraph  the Spectator  Standpoint magazine  the Daily Mail  The Times be virulently antitrans at the moment  I don \u2019 t know what Mr Murdoch have against u  but he have never be progressive  Before I transition  I be friendly with a colleague  We be commit to the work we do and the people we serve  Then I start test out whether transition would be possible  and on one of our work meal out together dressed female  Ann be revolt  She apologise to me about her revulsion  She be aware of the organisation \u2019 s diversity policy  and equality legislation  but after we work together on a strictly professional basis  I have great sympathy for her  Again  there be story we can tell about this  Ann might accept the word \u201c transphobia \u201d  We work around it  just a people tolerate an arachnophobe  protect them from spider  The arachnophobe may be ashamed but other people be accept  Or  you can be selfrighteous  call u dudeschapstransidentified malesmaletotranstrans right activist  I be not go to say that your reaction be irrational  it be for you to consider how proportionate it be  I do not want to disparage your fear of male violence against woman  but feminist whose life work be help woman who suffer male violence accept trans woman in their space  And it be not for me to tell you where to devote your campaign energy  but you can fight those feminist organisation  or you can fight conservatism  the establishment and the patriarchy  It be a tragedy when feminist fight amongst ourselves  Applause thunderous applause standing ovation  All congratulate me  and rush to tell of their Damascene conversion at my word  Or not  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 5 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
