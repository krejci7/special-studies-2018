alike we all be  It be not a new thought  the line in my mind be the Colonel \u2019 s Lady an \u2019 Judy O \u2019 Grady Are sister under their skin  and I stick by that on look at that whole poem  The auld sodger in whose voice it be slip away when Kipling say that  I be sure there be something Biblical on the thought  even if St Paul often articulate our different gift  A quick search for \u201c We be all one \u201d yield this  \u201c We be all brother and sister \u201d yield Glenn Beck  For a British person  whose glimpse of Fox News be in satire show how weird these Americans can be  with Beck the principal exhibit  that be a surprise  However  while it be a sentiment anyone may mouth  it be a truth each person have to see for themself  experientially  and ideally in the muck and mire of living  not just in meditation on retreat  Like j \u2019 s deepen conversation  What get in the way of the realisation be the mask each of u wear  pretend to be normal  The mask create a feeling of inadequacy  and impair our vision of other people  we think they be closer to \u201c normal \u201d than we be  I be take mine off  All the time  The mask of be male be impossible for me  but when I transition to female I still keep a great deal of my reserve and silence  which be also too painful for me  Quentin Crisp  gay when that be dangerous  say What I want be to be accept by other people without bevel down my individuality to please them because if I do that  all the attention  all the friendship  all the hospitality that I receive be really for somebody else of the same name  I want love on my own term  One friend say of my sharing  \u201c it be so wonderfully surprising how open and vulnerable you be  I truly admire you \u201d I discount that less than I would have at one time  A reserve and private man  quite eminent in his field  who once tell me of be very badly hurt by the dysfunctional Cardiff Quaker meeting  call my early effusion \u201c cry for help \u201d and counsel me against them  It be important for me to state precisely why I be so open and vulnerable  I be not show off my insecure spot to be rescue and validate by others  to have someone say \u201c there there \u201d and kiss me good  to be accept so that I can accept myself for that be what I want  and when I could not accept or value myself  no amount of validation express by others be enough for me  I be take off my mask because my aim be to accept and value all the bit which the mask hide  all the bit which I be selfconscious about  So that I can achieve the state in my tag line  \u201c Open heart  independent mind \u201d which I take from a strongminded friend who I think be close to that state than I be  Or Neil Peart \u2019 s Cinderella Man eye wide open heart undefended innocence untarnished This be the best way I can see right now towards my own flourishing and growth  and ability to survive in the world  I be take off the mask  or the Shell  because I can not live that way any more

I be a primate  and primate be social animal  So other people have great power over me  But the nature of that power and it exercise have change  All my friend do be touch me lightly on the arm two finger by the elbow and kiss me on the cheek  but such be the state of my heighten sensibility at the moment that I was the best word I can come up with for it be \u201c Unmanned \u201d  Moved to the core of my be  It be completely lovely  When I be try to pretend to be a man  repress all my feeling  that would have have no effect on me at all  I remain lonely  and starve for such connection and now it be possible  and I will find it  In the coffee shop  the woman behind the counter say \u201c That be \u00a3310  \u2018 s \u201d  I be not sure I have hear aright  What do you say  \u201c That \u2019 s \u00a3310 \u201d Did you say anything after that  She deny it  Then she say  \u201c There \u2019 s your change  sir \u201d  and this time admit it  So  calmly  I take time to explain to her  \u201c That be not the right word  What do you think the right word be  \u201d With the sound of disbelieve questioning  she say  \u201c Madam  \u201d So I explain to her that I be a woman  and I feel insult by the implication that I be a man  She apologise  Now  I be irritated  I do not have time for such petty game  and buy a coffee should be a pleasant experience  a I be sure Darcy WillsonRymer would agree  But I be no longer subject to this woman \u2019 s power  I be not  now  lie curl up in a ball on the floor weeping  a I might have be ten year ago  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 53
