only produce tediously obvious detail  On 19 April  he post his dreadful poetry  Battles lose and battle win yet nothing change but the name of martyred son and widow newly make  But what be this  A dream  Try to ignore the Mcgonagall scansion and excess of commas I learn her name  her age  her place And  so knowing  become ever more bewitched And  now  can not let go of any chance That dream and
