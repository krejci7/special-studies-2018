and felt great shame  So I would buy woman \u2019 s clothes compulsively and wear them  and I think  well  I have a stressful job  if this be how I manage to relax  why not  It do noone any harm  Then  after a week or so  I would throw them out  think  I be a man  this be unmanly and I do not want to be unmanly  so I will stop  Either of these position seem entirely sensible and acceptable to me  What I could not bear be oscillate madly between them  I lose count of the time I buy clothes and then throw them away  So I saw my GP  who refer me to a psychiatrist  privately  The psychiatrist think that I have transsexual tendency  but nevertheless refer me to a psychologist who offer me the choice  we could work together to try and make me feel more comfortable with crossdressing  or he could give aversion therapy  And I choose aversion therapy  I stand in front of a huge mirror  in underwear then in a dress  while they sit behind me  One tell me how ridiculous I look  one tell me how disgusted everyone family  friend  colleague  strangers would be if they saw me  and how noone could ever be attract to me  look like that  Then I dress male again  leave the clothes with them to dispose of  and do not dress again for six month  After six month I saw the psychologist again  and he be impress with how I have not lapse in six months and I take this  ridiculously  a permission to lapse  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 In 1996  I decide I do not want to be a sad  lonely pervert  I want to be a happy  gregarious pervert  So I buy myself a wig  and join the local TVTS club  There  I meet Fiona  a TV who go out and about  who take me off for several weekend on her boat on the Norfolk Broads  and Barbara  who introduce me to the Sibyls  I have some wonderful weekend with the Sibyls  where on Saturday night we would put on our evening dress and drink lot of wine and have earnest conversation about intention to transition and how frighten it be and be it really the right thing to do  And at the Northern Concord I felt a lot of the people be bloke down the pub  who happen to be dress rather strangely  and I felt different from them  Through them I find the Metropolitan Community Church  which help me to learn that I be acceptable to God with my idiosyncrasy  and there I meet Carol  my first girlfriend with whom I have dress female  and  not coincidentally  the first relationship I have which last more than two month  I do not like my body hair  so I shave it  and be unpractised at this  make two long scratch down the tendon on the back of my hand  My colleague ask how I have do that  and so I go to her office and tell her  It be so wonderful just to tell someone  She sympathise  rather than judge  It start to show me that the harsh judgment be in myself  not in others  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 When I be consider transition  in 2000  I read that there be a distinction between primary and secondary transsexual  Primary TSs be core TSs  who know that something be wrong aged three  know what it be age five  might be small and more lightly build  look female  and be attract to men  They transition young  Secondary transsexual transition in middle age or later  pass less well  and  bad  might be attract to woman  Some still use the repellent phrase \u201c homosexual transsexual \u201d for the male to female transsexual who be attract to men  the phrase deny that the person be female  This categorisation do not really fit FM TSs  I think this be an attempt at categorisation on insufficient data  and also that it confuse the core phenomenon of transsexuality with individual human response to it and the interaction of other characteristic  It be an attempt to understand and control the people seek transition  which be of course much good than imagine that we be all delude  and all should be refuse  But when I read that a a \u201c True transsexual \u201d or \u201c Primary transsexual \u201d I have to be attract to men  it influence me so that I deny that I be attract to woman  If I be not a true transsexual  it be obviously wrong for me to transition  I want to transition  and therefore I could not be attract to woman  Ridiculous a that be  I allow it subconsciously to influence me for ten year after until this  which end like this  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 In May 2000  I decide that I would do all I could to transition  I would seek a referral to a gender clinic  and see psychiatrist  And then I go to the Northern Concord and sit with the small group of transsexual people there  and hat them  Most do not have job  They seem frightened and withdrawn  So  three day after decide to transition  I decide I could not  Later in May  I find my Inner Toddler  my \u201c I Want \u201d  This part of me have be suppress in shadow  and in shadow it become something to fear  When I let her out she be Beautiful  though I still felt frighten of that energy  I hold a discussion between my male self  my female self  and my inner toddler  chair by my inner rationalist  My inner toddler \u2019 s contribution be  \u201c I want to wear skirt  and I want to walk down the street buy stuff \u201d  Even though I think when I decide to transition that my employer would find some unrelated excuse to sack me  wear skirt be eventually more important  And that employer in fact support me through my transition  and I work for them for another four year before get a good job in another organisation  I have a great deal of counselling  mostly person centre  and the most valuable thing a counsellor ever say to me be \u201c Of course you be transsexual  \u201d And he frighten me off  and I do not see him again for another six month  Eventually I realise that even if in five year \u2019 time I would be try to present male  transition be what I want Now  and try it be the only way to work out whether it be right for me  I think about autogynephilia  and secondary transsexualism  and decide that of the two question \u201c Am I transsexual  \u201d and \u201c Should I transition  \u201d the second be the most important  and Yes be the answer I want  And so at the end of November 2000  I go to my GP  and ask for a referral to a psychiatrist  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 I have thing I have to do before I could transition  I want to make a good start on electrolysis  a shave closely enough to go out dress make my skin sensitive  and I need in any event to let my facial hair grow for two day before it could be electrolysed  I have four hour of electrolysis a week  I want speech therapy  because my voice be one of the thing most likely to get me read a TS  I find the speech therapy very difficult  The therapist tell me that rather than do half an hour at a time  I should take a minute  say  on the stair in the office  or go to work  with an exercise  This do my head in  It be already bad enough spend the weekend female  and then on Monday morning have to go into work present male  I be not easy to be with on Monday morning  Then I would do a voice exercise  and connect to my female self at random time each day  then have to impose the male mask again  It be intolerable  I wake at four be  which be never a good time to make a decision  thinking of my colleague Vicky  Vicky have notice herself be \u201c clumsy \u201d  this have become serious enough for a referral to a neurologist  and three year after her diagnosis with MS she be in a wheelchair  And I felt such envy of her  because she be accept a female  that I would have swap place with her  So I think  that be it  I have to transition as soon a I can  That be six week before I transition at work  Now  I feel occasional pang of envy of a welldressed woman with a particularly gorgeous figure  but be happy in myself  on the whole  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 54 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
