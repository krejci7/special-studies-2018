Your lover have find you like a brazier which smoulder in the cold  a backdoor which keep out neither squall of wind nor storm  In a rage  she call on her father god Anu to give her Gugulanna the Bull of Heaven to take revenge on Gilgamesh  He refuse  but when she threaten to break open the door of the Underworld so that the dead shall eat food like the living  he relent  The bull snort and the Earth open  and the warrior of Uruk be kill  but Gilgamesh and Enkidu kill the bull  Inanna curse Enkidu  who throw the bull \u2019 s right thigh at her  For this  the Gods kill Enkidu  Inanna array herself a the Goddess  in royal robe and crown  and the breastplate call \u201c Come  man  come \u201d  then descend into the underworld to attend the funeral of Gugulanna  whose husband be her sister Ereshkigal  Queen of the Dead  She leave behind Ninshubur  her servant  with instruction if she do not return  She push aggressively at the door of the Underworld  and Ereshkigal command the doorman to open the seven door a crack  let her through but remove her royal garment  \u201c Let the holy priestess of heaven enter bow low \u201d When her garment be remove  Inanna protest  \u201c What be this  \u201d \u201c Be satisfy  Inana  a divine power of the underworld have be fulfil  Inana  you must not open your mouth against the rite of the underworld \u201d Or  \u201c Quiet  Inanna  the way of the underworld be perfect  They may not be questioned \u201d  The first come from this prose translation  the second from this verse translation   Inanna make Ereshkigal stand  and take her throne  but the seven judge shout her guilt  and she be turn to a corpse  hung on a hook  When she do not return  a instructed Ninshubur petition Inanna \u2019 s fatherGods Enlil  Nanna and Enki to rescue her  Enlil and Nanna refuse  say \u201c Inana crave the great heaven and she crave the great below as well  The divine power of the underworld be divine power which should not be crave  for whoever get them must remain in the underworld  Who  have get to that place  could then expect to come up again  \u201d Enki create two demon to rescue Inanna  He give them the lifegiving water  They go to the underworld and find Ereshkigal sick and in mourning  her unwashed hair \u201c bunch up a if it be leeks \u201d  They sympathise  and she offer them a river of water  They demand the corpse  sprinkle the lifegiving water on it  and bring Inanna to life  When Inanna return  she be escort by demon who will accept no sacrifice  but afflict humanity \u201c tear the wife from a man \u2019 s embrace \u201d  without pity  She must bring back a substitute  for noone have ascend unscathed from the Underworld  She find Ninshubur in mourning  and will not send her  but her husband Dumuzid be dress magnificently and seat on a throne  so she choose him  The demon seize him  He escape briefly  and his sister ask to share his fate  each will spend six month each year in the Underworld  \u2665\u2665\u2665 What do the story of Inanna mean  It be incantatory and repetitive  You would hear it a a story  and the repetition would please you like the return theme of a symphony  The Jungian interpretation be clear  Jesus say  When you strip naked without be ashamed  you will become child of God and have no more fear  Inanna \u2019 s finery be mere pretence  mask so she might look good though Isaiah 646 see them differently  we be all a an unclean thing  and all our righteousness be a filthy rag  Our pretence be strip away  and we be free  The individual garment may have individual interpretation  With the me in her possession  she have prepare herself  On her head she wear the shugurra  the crown of the steppe  Across her forehead her dark lock of hair be carefully arrange  Around her neck she wear the small lapis bead  At her breast she wear the double strand of bead  Her body be wrap with the royal robe   or  She cover her body with a pala dress  the garment of ladyship   Her eye be dab with the ointment call  \u201c let him come  let him come \u201d Around her chest she wear the breastplate call \u201c come  man  come \u201d On her wrist she wear the gold ring  In her hand she carry the lapis measure rod and line  What could each mean  Comment  Knock yourself out  Joshua J Mark  in the Ancient History Encyclopaedia  eschew the Jungian interpretation  the tale show how selfcentred and unfair a Goddess may be  and humanity suffers  Also the change of Dumuzid and his sister explain the season  Though myth may pass through many hand  and have meaning add  He think Ereshkigal be praise at the end of the poem Holy Ereshkigal  Great be your renown  Holy Ereshkigal  I sing your praise  because she seek justice against Inanna  but the Goddess of the Dead should be propitiate  especially after portray her a outsmart by her sister  For me  a myth speak to the unconscious  I can explain the meaning that we lose our pretence  our identity  when we find our unconscious  because I have become conscious of that  There may be other meaning in the story  I have be at thirdwaytrans again  He find the identity \u201c a trans woman \u201d a prison  because it mean we can no longer present male  A commenter bring up Inanna  First I try to please the World with my hypermanly persona  from Greek for mask  then  more truly me  with \u201c Clare \u201d  After descend into Hell  or reach rock bottom  I learn how valueless the mask be  Before I transition  I think that in five year \u2019 time I might be try to present male  but transition be the only way to get to that place  My identity a trans liberated aspect of myself I could not express otherwise  Unilantern  comment  claim masculine and feminine be patriarchal oppression  She produce a great long screed argue masculinity be see a instrumental  femininity a expressive  If a man be expressive he be see a feminine  But composer  painter  poet  philosopher  even writer  be until recently overwhelmingly male  Healingstars Goddessastrology compare the removal of the seven garment to the purification of the seven chakras  though chakras be understanding from a different culture  Hooray for eclecticism  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 30 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
