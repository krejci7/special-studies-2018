do not fit my understanding of myself  and he would say that the idea of be a pervert be unpleasant for most people  and I be in denial  have rewrite my history to make it seem more palatable  How to take away the shame  It be shameful to imagine that I have steadily reinforce a perversion until I have disappear into it  even if in the process it have burn itself out and  do what I fantasise about  I be not in a state of continuous arousal  Being attract to woman  I would have reduce substantially the pool of woman who might be attract to me  and destroy my ability to have child  Perhaps with selfcontrol I could have avoid this  So how do I take away the shame  apart from deny the validity of the theory   I believe that even if it be true  there be something beautiful about where I be now  something magical  and I seek to bring that magic out with other people  However I get here  here be a good place to be  And if that be whistle in the dark  what good would it do to think this so important aspect of my life disgust  Crossdreaming may be close to the truth  but I do not feel the need to know  Added  James Cantor  a supporter of the AGP theory  have write a letter to the Archives of Sexual Behavior cite study which appear to show that while MF TS folk may have feminine brain structure  these be limit to \u201c homosexual \u201d  that be  androphile  trans woman  However \u201c heterosexual \u201d  \u201c autogynephiliac \u201d  that be  gynephile  trans woman also have brain distinguishable from those of cissexuals  He write  although these data disconfirm that the heterosexual type have a feminize brain pattern\u2014the data nonetheless confirm that heterosexual transsexual have a brain structure distinct from that of typical  nontranssexual  person  Their gender identity be not a transient or ephemeral characteristic  but a likely innate and immutable characteristic  emerge from their particular brain structure  That be the absolution I still need  It be not my fault  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Monday 19th  Hang it  \u201c I be Autogynephiliac \u201d  I be autogynephiliac  I just be  I have be so ashamed of that  and the shame make me fight it for year  and try to make a man of myself  and I could not  Yesterday  ten year after transition  I be curl up in a ball on the floor cry over the shame of it  And  I do not think I could be other than I be  Had I exercise more selfcontrol  could I be happily marry with child and living a a man  Looking at that struggle  I have vast resource of selfcontrol  and I show courage and Tenacious Strength  I have carry the shame  and now I have bring it to full consciousness and wept over it I hope I may continue let it go  This make me transsexual  Indeed there may be \u201c Two distinct phenomenon  with separate etiology \u201c  but no less moral value of one than the other  no less value a a human be  The blog in the link have two purpose  One be to show that there be two kind of transsexuality  what be sometimes call \u201c primary transsexualism \u201d  and autogynephilia  which be link to erotic arousal  and the other be to show that the person write anonymously be unequivocally and certainly of the first kind  It stink  It be one long drone repetition of the refrain  \u201c I may be a weirdo but at least I be not a weird and horrible a those weirdos \u201d  In the post link to  there be a sad insistence that there be gay people in her family  Yes  you who call yourself \u201c silly \u201d  there be some instance of TS sibling  but it be not the case that all sibling of TS people be TS  She have turn off comment on her blog  because  she say  people attack her for tell the truth about the evidence  However  the truth do not hurt  It never do  What hurt be the bigoted and prejudiced reaction of others  There be nothing shameful in who I be  I feel shame because it have be inculcate into me in a toxic way  The silly one be reinforce that prejudice  As Razan Ghazzawi say  we need to be a one  not divide into different group  28 December  I click on my own link  knock on her door  so to speak  and see that in her first post since she have change her name to \u201c cloudy \u201d  Don \u2019 t worry  cloudy  you will always be silly to me  This post be about how some study fail to differentiate clearly between AGP and  in the word of the researcher  \u201c homosexual \u201d TS  but that be because the study be defective not because there be no genuine difference  The new name be well choose  because the thinking be cloudy  The post still insist on her identity  and her difference from me  I find this suspect  I think the introduction have be change  though  In the sidebar  she write that she be work to reduce the internalized shame and intolerance between the two type of TranWomen by explain the difference in a nonjudgemental  scientific exploration  \u201c Different than \u201d never mean \u201c good than \u201d  To reduce the internalised shame  she could emphasise evidence that both manifestation of the phenomenon of transsexualism be innate  Repetitively point out difference do not reduce shame  I also prefer trans woman to \u201c TranWomen \u201d  sic  because a trans woman be a woman who happen to be trans  and a transwoman be something different  Here be a Swedish outcome study  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 26 January 2012  I think if there be any causal link between autogynephilia and transsexuality in lesbian trans woman  it be the other way around  We be innately female  and attract to woman  and because of that be arouse by the idea of ourselves a woman  I do not think that the female identity could be so permanent if it arise simply from a sexual perversion  Jack Molay argue it be not a mental disorder  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 March  the silly one have break her three month \u2019 silence  with a long rant about how autogynephilia be exclusively a paraphilia  \u201c You \u2019 re all pervert  \u201d she screech  \u201c All of you  \u201d This at least give the lie to her claim  redolent of apartheid  that \u201c different than never mean good than \u201d  Whereas  if she really be \u201c work to reduce internalised shame \u201d she would be consider the nature of a paraphilia  My old model of a blank slate  naturally heterosexual  me  by accident crossdressing one day and slowly through obsessive thought and masturbation turn myself into a pervert  while if I have only have a little self control I could be a normal husband and father  really can not be it  The silly one rant that AGP cause lesbian transsexuality  None of the data can be say to prove that at all  Full post come up on this  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 54 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
