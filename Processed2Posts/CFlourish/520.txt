it have such a perfect clarity about what it want  what make it happy  that it seem like a child  a child often have that clarity  This be what Matthew 183 mean  unless you change and become like little child  you will never enter the kingdom of heaven  Ha  and again Ha  Not \u201c Mild  obedient  good a He \u201d but in touch with their desire  and bent on carry them out  Knowing that those desire be constructive and creative for learn and exploration  and that there be no failure  until you stop work towards something  One may be that child and be fully mature  with all the wisdom of your year  Possibly one can not be fully mature without be that child  Perhaps  also  we talk of the \u201c inner child \u201d because we fear it  and want to disrespect it  and call it less than the mature intellectual adult  People fear the emotional be so much  and repress it  and because our parent in their thankless task of civilise u a they themselves be civilise  fear and repress it  Repressed  it gain the energy of the repression  and become the Id monster  because it claim freedom  That hurt  Possibly  when I suppress my emotional be I stop it mature properly  so it really need to undergo stage of development which ideally it would pass through before physical maturity  And I think the work I be do in my ritual space  love and care for the baby Clare  be necessary work  gentle and reassure my emotional be like a frightened horse or dog  so that she may take her rightful place beside my intellect  work together  each do the work appropriate to herself and not intrude on the other \u2019 s realm  I have a room in my heart for Baby Clare  which be quite unspecific at the moment red  soft  warm because it be she who get to decide how it will be  I cuddle the baby there I be my own guardian angel  my own high self  and my own most vulnerable self and if at any time she decide she would like to get about  crawl  walking  she will learn to do that there  surround at all time with my own unconditional Love  Does this make any sense to you at all  I be write it here  rather than in my journal  to prove to myself that I be sufficiently unashamed of it  and sufficiently convince of it rational value to show it off  Yes  I do want external validation  I imagine that would make me feel more comfortable  And yet I know myself sufficiently well to know that I will go my own way  whatever anyone else think

Jesus a a child  from the infancy gospel of Thomas  And when Jesus be five year old  there fell a great rain upon the earth  and the boy Jesus walk up and down through it  And there be a terrible rain  and He collect it into a fishpond  and order it by His word to become clear  And immediately it become so  Again He take of the clay which be of that fishpond  and make of it to the number of twelve sparrow  And it be the Sabbath when Jesus do this among the boy of the Jews  And the boy of the Jews go away  and say to Joseph His father  Behold  thy son be play along with u  and he take clay and make sparrow  which it be not lawful to do on the Sabbath  and he have break it  And Joseph go away to the boy Jesus  and say to Him  Why hast thou do this  which it be not lawful to do on the Sabbath  And Jesus open His hand  and order the sparrow  say  Go up into the air  and fly  nobody shall kill you  And they fly  and begin to cry out  and praise God Almighty  No  I don \u2019 t believe it  but if Jesus be God  and a human child  would he not play game like that  That he would not be the doctrine of Kenosis

I look at the Tag surfer quite a lot  all post with a particular tag show in one place  Recently Lexie Cannes  a trans activist  write about Mischa Popoff  a campaigner against trans right  whom she call \u201c hardly worth mention \u201d  At least she answer the rubbish he write  Dr Eowyn mostly quote  to spread anger and resentment among her conservative reader about the Transsexual Menace to our Children  I prefer post where people write on what please them  I do not want to be depress  There be positive story about  Popoff oppose the introduction of education on trans issue in Canada  Hooray  That mean it be a live issue  and other people be work for that education  I recommend Dr Eowyn \u2019 s post  because it contain a great deal of useful information on how to bring up healthy  welladjusted child with a wide spectrum of behaviour traditionally more associated with one gender than the other  I be grateful to her for introduce me to Gender Spectrum  She will not be please at give such aid and comfort to her adversary  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 52 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
