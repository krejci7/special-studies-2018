younger  through that game  Just after M \u2019 s sixteenth birthday  they meet in person  Sexual activity take place  Was it a sexual assault  We don \u2019 t know if JustineScott be trans  From the Court of Appeal judgment  The presentence report speak of a history of self harm and confusion surround her gender identity and sexuality  which be resolve  From a statement to the police  age 13 they use a male avatar \u201c because it make her more comfortable \u201d  The psychologist say that there be evidence of rationalisation  distort thinking process and victimblaming  The judge do not find the appellant entirely credible  but  confusion over gender identity and sexuality would make honesty very difficult  There be nothing shameful about homosexuality or transsexuality  but teenager receive the message that there be  Internalising that  unable perhaps to admit truth to ourselves  we start to make statement which we hope might be acceptable  even if they be inconsistent to ourselves as well a others  You have to come out to yourself before you can come out to anyone else  \u201c It make me more comfortable \u201d be a thing I might feel able to say before I would definitely have say  \u201c I be trans \u201d  When they meet  JustineScott wear a strapon  This be teenage exploration  what be it like  How do it feel  What do I want for it be not what the culture tell me I should want  Even straight find this difficult  Unless M have consent  or Justine have reasonably believe she have  the sexual activity be unlawful  In the Sexual Offences Act 2003  a person consent if  s  he agree by choice and have the freedom and capacity to make that choice  Certain deception  accord to the judge  vitiate that capacity  The evidence relate to \u201c choice \u201d and the \u201c freedom \u201d to make any particular choice must be approach in a broad commonsense way  they hold  When be consent vitiate  In Sweden  Julian Assange promise to use a condom  but do not  In an English case  a woman consent on the basis that the man would practise coitus interruptus  but he allegedly intend to ejaculate inside her  Both would be rape in English law  However  In reality  some deception  such a  for example  in relation to wealth  will obviously not be sufficient to vitiate consent  Failure to disclose HIV status do not vitiate consent  but a deliberate false statement that the accuse be HIV negative might  The accused \u2019 s false claiming to be unmarried  or to be rich  do not vitiate consent beyond the judge \u2019 \u201c common sense \u201d  or prejudice  it be not clear why  While  in a physical sense  the act of assault by penetration of the vagina be the same whether perpetrate by a male or a female  the sexual nature of the act be  on any common sense view  different where the complainant be deliberately deceive by a defendant into believe that the latter be a male  Assuming the fact to be prove a alleged  M choose to have sexual encounter with a boy and her preference  her freedom to choose whether or not to have a sexual encounter with a girl  be remove by the appellant \u2019 s deception  A lesbian pretending to be a boy have no defence  I find this an injustice  at least in the case of hurting  confuse  selfharming Justine McNally  She be the victim of society  not the guilty party  Trans people have the difficulty that while I assert that I be female  the law state that I be male  until I get my gender recognition certificate  When I express myself female before transition  there be no deliberate deception  The law can not have it both way  The law say I be male  however in that case there be two group of people who express female woman  and people like me  So if a prospective partner saw me present female  the possibility should be in her mind that I be that sort of person  I do not dress female to deceive anyone I dress female because I be who I be  After my GRC  there be certainly no deception  I be female  accord to law  The problem be that the law consider the choice of the complainant  What would make the complainant change herhis mind  Wanting sex with a woman  but not a trans woman  might  That might make people imagine that \u201c the sexual nature of the act\u2026 be different \u201d  The Crown Prosecution Service provide guidance on whether a charge could be prove  Whether there have be deception a to gender will require very careful consideration of all the surround circumstance include  How the suspect perceive hisher gender  What step  if any  heshe have take to live a hisher chosen identity  and What step  if any  heshe have take to acquire a new gender status  Now  my gender be Clare  Some would see me a a man  and I win \u2019 t worry about that too much cos life \u2019 s too short  Some see me a a woman  and that make me happy  Some see me a a trans woman  and that be not much good than see me a a man  frankly  If I explain that to a policeman  that might make my position bad than someone who say \u201c I \u2019 m a woman \u201d  All step to live a the chosen identity should matter  Before I decide that I would transition  I dress female to see if I could bear it  if the abuse have be too great  I might have have to just present male  In my own mind  that be tie up with the question \u201c Am I transsexual  \u201d The CPS also must decide whether prosecution be in the public interest  They should consider Whether the offending occur a a result of the suspect uncertainty or ambivalence about hisher gender identity  but that do no good to Justine McNally  What about \u201c reasonable belief \u201d in consent  If you be a trans woman and you assert to everyone  \u201c I be a woman \u201d  and you don \u2019 t make any attempt to hide your body from the sight of your partner  you be probably OK  The people who be actually prosecute be confuse and hurt  in shame and fear of their identity and sexuality  That be  the most vulnerable of u be the one most likely to be criminalise  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 26 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
