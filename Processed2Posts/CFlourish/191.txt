advance our own wellbeing  If that mean tell story and truths other people find uncomfortable  so be it  She spend four year on T  present male  and have revert  Yet she want transitioned and detransitioned people to be ally  and be not help by people use her story a a weapon against transition  So  how could we be ally  I don \u2019 t know of any detransitioned woman who doesn \u2019 t believe that adult can decide what to do with their life and their body  include to transition if they decide that \u2019 s what \u2019 s best for them  No  that would be a detransitioned man  Charles Kane  fill with resentment for what he do to himself  That might be something about female socialisation  grow up to make the best of it and see others \u2019 point of view  However she want to speak out for detransitioned and dysphoric women\u2026 because no one else be look out for u  She bear the scar of transition chest masculinisation  T use and have a deep voice and facial hair  She be forge a new path  transition be welltravelled  with many book and support group on what it mean  but on detransition she find only a few blog  First  I find her blog post about the backlash from the article about detransition in a new online magazine The Outlook  then go to the article itself  I would like u to be ally  Anyone who transition have have difficulty live with themselves in a gendered society  even if they detransition  We have a lot in common  Why be she call transphobic  This quote from The Outlook may give a clue  The blogger write about how they \u2019 ve come to understand their own transition a a response to trauma  or an expression of selfhatred stem from living in a patriarchal world  or a capitulation to social pressure  I might see their detransition in the same way the only word I might change be \u201c patriarchal \u201d to \u201c transphobic \u201d  and even that be not absolutely necessary  I have think about detransition a lot  and always call it \u201c Reverting \u201d  That \u2019 s a different way of frame it  a a failure  This be how we be opponent in a zerosum game  if detransitioners be people who should never have be diagnose with gender dysphoria in the first place  but treat otherwise than by transition people who have be wrong by the system then it should be much more difficult to get hormone or surgery  I should be accept a a woman because I really be a woman  This be the basis for our argument that we should enter womenonly space  be treat a woman  be recognise in law a woman  Psychiatrists who specialise in u have the expertise to diagnose gender dysphoria  for which the treatment be medical  surgical and social transition  But it \u2019 s a zerosum game  Crash could not have be prevent from transition without it be make more difficult for the rest of u  The Outline cite study that regret be 22  or less make transition more difficult stymy forty people for the sake of one  Arbitrated by fairness or Utilitarianism  my side should win the zerosum game  And  possibly  many who revert might not have take no for an answer when they transition  I really be a woman  Or  the only treatment for gender identity disorder be transition  Crash say she suffer from internalised misogyny  trauma and dissociation  I learn The Script  what I be tell I should say to ensure I get the right diagnosis  The Script be not true for me  I tell the truth  and get the diagnosis and treatment anyway  If Crash could have be protect from transition  a real trans man might have be wrongfully refused it and give that hormone and surgery be so invasive  psychiatrist might err on the side of caution  But when we transition  we really really want that treatment  I do not trust the psychiatrist  I don \u2019 t think there be clear discrete group  one of which suffer from gender dysphoria who should transition  and another whose symptom mimic those of the first but who suffer from some different diagnosable condition  dissociative disorder or something else  My psychiatrist tell me I be \u201c not psychotic \u201d but I don \u2019 t know he be right about that  I don \u2019 t think I be dissociative  I hat my body before transition  Now  I love it  What would I know  On what basis be Crash diagnose a dissociative be it just because she have decide to revert  I wish diagnosis could be certain  but it be more messy than that  I want Crash a an ally  because we have a great deal in common  We be both people who do not easily fit the stereotype attach to our birth gender  the social construct of \u201c man \u201d in my case  \u201c woman \u201d in hers  We try to make our way a best we can  We live in gendered society  with expectation about what a man or a woman ought to be like  even if those expectation be broad and more inclusive than I  desperate because I saw myself a less than a real man  imagine them to be  There be those who would argue that Trans be a great lie  that the removal of breast penis and gonad be a vile mutilation  and we should accept our body  Some of them be religious nutter with rigid idea of what \u201c Biblical Manhood and Womanhood \u201d be  and some be radical feminist who think gender role be a misogynist social construct impose by patriarchy  Yet we desperately want social andor physical transition  When I transition  I think it be quite possible that I would revert within five year  but transition be the only way I could find that out  I want it so much  I have to try it  I have not revert yet  This might escape the zerosum game  that detransition be right for a person do not mean that transition be necessarily wrong  Or  alternatively I be not a woman  or even a person who particularly well fit the social construct of \u201c woman \u201d in my society  only someone who have choose to identify a Clare  and I have a right to identify like that  or a Stephen  or Hillary  That detransition be right for someone do not mean it be right for everyone  or that anyone should be stop from transition because they might revert later  It be not clear cut  but confuse  and people make mistake  Whatever  I want to extend a hand of friendship to Crash  We be both people who have be uncomfortable with gender role  and have do what we think best in response to that  Let u honour our choice and mourn our mistake together  I doubt I could have be save from myself  None of these choice be easy  that we have all face them be a bond   That \u2019 s just me I like to see thing in term of common interest and common experience   Crash link to this video  \u201c We \u2019 re not recruit  okay  \u201d say the detransitioned woman  \u201c This be about people \u2019 s wellbeing \u201d  I want their wellbeing  as well a my own  Continued here  Detransition II  on
