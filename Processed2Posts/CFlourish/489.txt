with D Last night be her birthday party  and next week she will move in with him  At Hogmanay  I wear a mini skirt and a rather demure top  Yesterday I go shop with my hostess S down Kilburn High St and get a lace front human hair wig for \u00a335   amaze  and a black thing of lace  bead and sequin loosely tie between the breast  show off flesh around the navel  and a lace pair of short  Worn without a bra  it be not something to wear on the Tube if travel alone  Alas  no photograph  I want to be out there  I want to celebrate myself a a sexual be  I want to show off my bare leg  and my midriff  because woman tell me my leg be a good feature  and woman be the people I want to attract  I do not want to hide myself away  I also want to experiment with this  it be just not the way I have dress  before  even at tranny do  N think I look a if I be try too hard  she really dislike my usual wig  too   U  whose long skirt beautifully show shift impression of her leg  appreciate me  and lean me a chunky silver necklace  more suited than my Moonstone to the ensemble  \u201c The bedroom be the place to be  \u201d she say  \u201c No  the place to be be the room I be in  \u201d I reply  It be a summer party  start about five pm  and most people be dress fairly casually  There be about 25 of u in the flat  about half of whom I know  Bloke in shirt and slack come up to me and say  \u201c Hello  I \u2019 m Tim \u201d I \u2019 m Clare  \u201c So  you \u2019 re trans then \u201d I be astound  and not in a good way  Later  I be chat to Paul  a DJ with Jazz FM  \u201c I \u2019 m Paul  by the way \u201d I \u2019 m Clare  \u201c So  why do you choose that name  then  \u201d I be irk at that  Second mention  and I wonder if it have something to do with my way of selfpresenting  He refuse to admit that he have realise I have change my name because I be trans  He start tell me that a lot of black people of his generation have change their name from slave owner \u2019 name to African name  I be so irked that I do not point out I be white he can see that  after all  He say he interview people  Monica  his sevenyear girlfriend  join u  Third conversation  S tell me how she have a girlfriend 16 year old  twenty year ago  After they have be together for a year  she be look through one of her partner \u2019 s book and a photo fell out of it  They fight over the photo but she run with it to the bathroom  and there realise that it be her partner  present male before transition  S have not realise until then that she be TS  S find this a dealbreaker  think her partner have be dishonest  but the partner explain she have be advise by her therapist to put \u201c her male life \u201d completely behind her and live in the present moment  S leave her  This show that pass to an amazing extent for a year in a lesbian relationship be possible  make me feel bad  Paul say I should have say to Tim  \u201c No \u201d  or  \u201c What do you mean by that  \u201d Well  I be a bit surprised when he say it  \u201c What do you say  \u201d I could not remember  Why should it matter  anyway  Because it be load  It mean most to me  it be my life  but it mean thing to others a well  And he put me in a box  Do nt define me before you have even talk to me  The day before  someone have choose to unburden himself to me about his crossdressing experience  I try to encourage him  say it be alright  no big deal  if that be how you want to relax you go ahead jumping to conclusion  really  Responding too quickly out of my stuff  His tone of voice have give some indication that be appropriate  but he might have want to celebrate it  Around eleven  there be a mellow late evening feel  Eva come with her friend Michael  a musician with a keyboard  and we jam  two guitar  a flute  and some of the rest of u sing voicelessly  Oh look  my glass be empty  Let me go and fill it up  Energy return  I dance close with U  and then with Jack  I feel wide open  and weep  The weeping help me get into the present moment  Jack see this  I feel he be give me something beautiful  the space to seek to dance spontaneously in his arm  follow not lead  rather than playacting  assess and judge how I be dance and think through  intellectually  what I should do  This be an animal  feelingbased activity  I be almost there I weep again  in frustration  Not quite a whore a whore would wear a skirt rather than short  As N point out  If not all of it give me pleasure  the party certainly give me a worthwhile challenge   What do I want from such a conversation  \u201c So  you \u2019 re trans  then  \u201d It be not safe to assume that this be a man to whom I can unload my own angst and be comfort  or even explain so that he will understand and affirm me  It would be easy if I have really internalise that be transsexual be a blessing  I do not want a sterile verbal joust  try to get the other to state a position and then challenge it  but I would like to make it an exploration of his Stuff  \u201c What do you mean by that  What do you think of that  \u201d And be prepare to withdraw if necessary  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 49 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
