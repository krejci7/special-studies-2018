"text": "I be a \u201c woman trap in a man \u2019 s body \u201d  Except I be not  Brian Cox refute concept of ghost  soul  mind separate from the brain with CERN  the particle accelerator  CERN show how baryonic matter electron  neutron  protons interact  It exclude any spiritual stuff exert an influence on those proton  If they do  CERN would have observe it  Do I have a \u201c woman \u2019 s brain \u201d  It be unclear  and strongly dispute  Last century  neurologist observe how people with impairment have particular damage to the brain  and deduce that the damage part have the function impair  but now we learn of brain plasticity  where experience alter the brain itself  It be hard to distinguish the effect of nature and nurture  Women give birth  and be generally though not universally small and weak than men  I can not name a single characteristic of woman but not of men which I share with woman  otherwise than by medical or surgical intervention  Some cis men be more \u201c feminine \u201d than some woman  I would rather think of it a a matter of desire  I desire to express myself in this way  I only know my true nature from how I behave  though I might have potentiality which I have not develop because of circumstance  Given my circumstance  I choose to behave in this way  We know it be an ancient and widespread behaviour  Deuteronomy 225 forbids it  People do it spontaneously  and culture form around it  in Norse mythology it be simply a disguise  to achieve a manly end by deception  not selfexpression a an end in itself  It be more important to me than anything else in the world  And before that  resist the desire felt like a matter of life and death to me  I remain at war with myself  It seem to me I have a kernel or colonel  give order  which will not be denied with particular feeling and response  and overlay on that responses to the underlying feeling  Desire  and terror or revulsion  which lead me in the 1990s to buy clothes then throw them out a score of time  and now Now  I freeze and go into avoidance behaviour  Deep Space Nine on TV  again  and a I have forget it and do not watch much of the late season  and have a lot of time  I watch it  In Profit and Lace  Grand Negus Zek decree that female can leave their house and seek profit like male  and Quark have surgery to appear female in order to achieve something plotbased  but mostly produce laughter and embarrassment as well a a few genderpolitical point  I find it embarrass  There be Nog  run  desperately try to whatever  and I reach for the NYT to take my mind off it  Then I pause it  and considered I can watch it  stop it  or pay it a little attention while I glance at opinion article  I do not want to watch it a it embarrass me  I do not want to stop it  because I do not want to  appear to myself to be  run from it  That would be cowardly  or something  I pick up the computer  saw this be avoidance activity  take my mind off the original issue  and could not decide to put it down or read it  I freeze  I know read the plot summary that it would be embarrass  Now  I be consciously confront a choice which I make unconsciously so often watch  switch off  avoidance behaviour read while it be on  and all option revolt me so I freeze between them unable to do any  Well  either watch or switch off  but do not read while it be on  that be the freeze itself  not pay attention  wait for the problem to go away  Then  do not switch off I will confront my embarrassment  because I need to be able to confront  I take an age to decide  hat myself that this which should be nothing would be a problem for me  then watch  It take courage to see entertainer make joke about the thing most important to me  I will not run from it  even though noone see me run  Courage or ridiculousness  worry about nothing  freeze rather than act  I frame or express this in moral term  which may increase my confusion I want to turn it off  but I want to imagine that I be brave  and might imagine that it be cowardly to turn it off  In that context  the theory give me permission  I be a woman  I want to behave in such a way  present in such a way  because I be a woman  and because I be a woman I be allow to behave like that  Then the theory be attack  Of Course I be not a woman  say the radical feminist  the conservative evangelicals  and even the psychiatrist who call a trans woman attract to men \u201c homosexual \u201d  And I be bereft  pull between desire and revulsion  without a compass to guide my action  It seem to me that the revulsion will only prevent me from do thing  or will make me conform to behaviour which seem to me to be acceptable to others in a joyless  dead way  the only motivation bare survival  And the desire  to behave like a trans woman  at least give me a positive motivation  Yet a man who have give up heroin tell me that the world merely seem grey and joyless without it  When I be buy clothes and throw them away  it seem like addiction  Nothing make sense to me  Yet I will seek out that kernel  to use it a my guide  and seek to pass through the fear and revulsion  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page
