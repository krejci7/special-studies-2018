"sensitivity", "transition"], "text": "Not only be I a real woman  I would go even far to say that a transgender woman have more claim to womanhood than a \u201c biological \u201d woman  A transgender woman have reach womanhood by the arduous path of achievement rather than by accident of nature  Those who climb Mount Everest have a great claim to win that peak than someone accidentally drop there by helicopter  Sam Kane have be interview in the Daily Mail again  I wish she would stop digging  \u201c I have have it hard than cis woman have \u201d be not a winning argument  Some cis woman feel they be drop in a jungle to fend for themselves without proper training or defensive equipment  when these trans woman appear to be on safari  a a holiday  You don \u2019 t know how hard other people have have it  Consider my friend  enrage at men press her for sex from the age of 13  and not feel able to say \u201c I just don \u2019 t fancy you \u201d because she be socialise into be accommodate  though her evasion be take a a personal insult  \u201c Only \u2018 I have a boyfriend \u2019 be an acceptable excuse  because then you be someone else \u2019 s property \u201d  \u201c Now  I intimidate men  \u201d she say without a smile  Sam  I meet people at transsexual club who keep say how fantastic it be to be a woman and how happy they be  and I think it would be the solution to all my problem  We go to different club  obviously  I meet people who say how hard it be  but with determination and a lot of work they might just manage  When I transition  I think my employer would find some pretext to sack me and I go ahead anyway  Sam Kane  who have transition MFM  with vaginoplasty  then some sort of operation to create an \u201c approximation \u201d of male genitalia  have now transition back  but do not feel she need further surgery  Does it really matter what \u2019 s \u201c down there  \u201d What \u2019 s in your head  heart and soul only matter  Well  that be the fashion  We all have The Operation back then  now increase number don \u2019 t  And we object to journalist pry and disclose what be between our leg  in prurient  sly  giggly article for Daily Mail reader to get shocked or turn on over  Their very headline say she have her male organ remove in an operation  The fast car  the yacht  the competition to have the prettiest or the young girlfriend \u2014 it be all a theatre  a charade to fit into this male club I never really want to join  From childhood I felt female  but I be ambitious and the two be always in conflict  so I become almost a caricature of what a \u201c real \u201d man be expect to be  Mmm  The job below my ability  because just living be difficult  the isolation because I be always pretend  the shame and discomfort and not fit in my own skin I too feel she be on safari  Noone have it easy a trans  and it be not always easier after transition  and I really want to sympathise with her struggle  pain and difficulty but she alienate me  During her marriage breakdown  Sam first think himself bisexual then start to question gender identity  Some would query late onset  and say aha  they be not true trans  Not me  For me  be trans be make so difficult by society that if you claim you be trans  you be  But this line encourage the hater  like Jenni Murray quote here  \u201c simply choose to become a woman \u201d  a if it be a whim  This be the bit I hate her for  Like many transgender woman  I try to turn myself into an ultrafeminine  perfect woman  I be try to live up to the feminine ideal  so I wear sexy clothes and makeup  I learn how to walk and talk a certain way  I just want to be accept  Like many trans woman  I schlep around in jean much of the time  even without makeup  I express myself feminine because I be feminine  Often  I have to defend myself against the allegation that my femininity be an act  I do not express myself so feminine because I feel that be how woman should be  but because I be this feminine  We all \u201c just want to be accept \u201d but be publicly trans  write a book about her struggle  may not be the best way  Some will see her a courageous  some a ridiculous  Find the people who accept you  and ignore the rest  She detransitioned because she want accepted by her family  but find she be not accept a a feminine male by client and peer  Noone be accept by everyone  If people can wind you up by refer derisively to your masculinity or femininity  they will  The only way to survive be not to get wind up  As Charles  he go to his son \u2019 s wedding  It be very civilised  Everyone be very welcoming and no one say anything unpleasant  but I felt like an embarrassment and it hurt  That begin to make me sympathise again  She be so sensitive  I want to walk barefoot on the grass in the sunshine  but there be gravel between the front door and the lawn  I walk gingerly over the gravel  and it make me think of the Little Mermaid  whose every step on dry land be like walk on knife  Yes  it be painful but the pain be not the only thing  there be so much beauty  Our sensitivity be a burden and a delight  we be easily hurt but easily delight  and we can sympathise with others  enter their woe and joy  You need to learn to be sensitive to your own sensitivity  Even now  I don \u2019 t think she get it  She have it hard  Someone point to her and ask  \u201c Is that a real woman  \u201d The next thing I know  a fist be fly through the air and I end up with a broken nose  The provocation be merely exist  We all have our story like that  Yet she be follow her own desire again  Do you think I would have go through all this suffering and sacrifice if there wasn \u2019 t something inside so strong tell me I be woman  The whole notion that a transgender woman be not a real woman be false  We be not talk about castrate male  or gay men in drag  we be not fake  That would not convince my friend  She would accept the conviction  but say \u201c woman \u201d be physical  not emotional  so Sam be not a woman  As for me  I want to be treat a a woman  I want allowance make for my inability to present male  a allowance be make for disability  But insist \u201c I be a real woman \u201d just encourage the hater  Many mock  and she lay herself open to that  The quote be take from a Daily Mail article  Don \u2019 t give them click  it only encourage them  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 15 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
