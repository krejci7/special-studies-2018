\u201d and \u201c femininity \u201d  which do not fit men and woman a we really be  At it bad  toxic masculinity reject the expression of emotion apart from anger and derision  Boys and men be expect to put on a manly mask which suffocate them  Women be objectify  value for their look  treat a weaker and needing look after by men while make responsible for most housework and care of child  the disabled and elderly  Feminists call this \u201c patriarchy \u201d and differ in their emphasis on how it affect men  but it hurt everyone apart from a very few highstatus men  Patriarchy fits noone  Everyone need to deny part of themselves to fit in  Those who particularly do not fit be trans  or translike people  To call myself a \u201c feminine \u201d man be ridiculous  a \u201c feminine \u201d relate to woman  but the word have come to denote quality prescribe by patriarchy for woman  such a be sensitive  empathetic  compassionate  communal  unselfish  supportive  motherly  nurture  gentle  forgiving  and care  These be my natural quality  though my attempt to be a \u201c Real Man \u201d have twist me  Femininity can also refer to certain mannerism  body language  or physical appearance  I be mostly interested in trans woman  Some of what I say could also apply to trans men  and I could use inclusive language  but will discuss trans woman only  Trans woman may be Gynephile  attract to woman  or Androphile  attract to men  Androphiles be call \u201c Homosexual \u201d by the researcher  deny that they be woman  and Gynephiles be call \u201c Nonhomosexual \u201d  which I find demean  even though some of u present a bisexual or asexual  If I be not a woman then I be heterosexual  attract to woman  Trans in androphile and gynephiles may be different phenomenon with different causation  There be research on trans  and on the wide question of whether femininity and masculinity have any reality separate from culture  There be a wide range of masculinity and femininity in men and woman  but by and large woman be more feminine  Whether nature cause this  or nurture  culture and society  be strongly dispute  I would not accuse researcher of fit the evidence to their preconception  but the question be so political that they might choose research project to confirm their claim  and interpreter can be wholly political  I read one conservative Christian sniffing that trans woman \u2019 s brain be different because we obsess about trans  promote dendrite growth in particular area  And even if parent of both sex expect a toddler boy to slide down a steep slide than girl the same age  what could that mean  I do not have the time or education to assess individual research paper  leave alone the wider question  Studies show some brain differences in the 1990s I be aware that brain dissection have find the BSTc  the central subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis  be twice the size in men a in woman  slightly large in gay men  and female size in trans woman  but what could cause that or what it could mean be a mystery to me  We could use it for large claim  that trans woman be apart from men  really woman  and some do  and there be a huge backlash  Brain research do not justify the large claim of some trans folk  There be no clear cutoff between trans and cisgendered  There be a spectrum of masculinity to femininity in men  So other circumstance will decide whether you transition  such a whether you have a partner and what they feel about it  what your job prospect be  or how well you pass  I read of a person who have be the subject of a documentary on transition  but stop when he find a male partner  Some men be arouse by crossdressing  or by thought of themselves a woman  This be more likely a byproduct of be feminine than the cause of transition  Some be satisfied with recreational crossdressing  at the Northern Concord  it seem to me that some be just blokes down the pub  who happen to be dress rather strangely  and some be feminine  My particular interest be the gynephile trans woman  especially me  and her counterpart the masculine woman  virago and harridan  sissy and pansy  This be the sexual orientation that have only hurtful names the woman \u201c wear the trouser \u201d  the man be \u201c pussywhipped \u201d  \u201c Beta male \u201d may be a more positive term  or \u201c Alpha female \u201d  but both these term be claim by other group  My parent be like this  terrify of people find out  and inculcate in me terrible shame  My mother would not let me play with Action Man because \u201c boy should not play with doll \u201d  My father object to woman on Radio 4  claim to loathe the sound of their voice  In the Underground last week I saw a woman  her leg cross  her foot against the shin of her man  hold his hand and squeezing or pinch it  I felt they might have such a relationship  and felt envy  It be not the same a BDSM  I don \u2019 t know how the desire to present female and actual femininity be relate  I tend to feel that some men feel that their characteristic be more acceptable in woman  and it be in part a desire to fit in with social norm  I lay on the floor weep \u201c I be not a man \u201d  if only I could have realise I be not that kind of man  Though I have the operation  I oppose it  I have it because I think that it would make me part of an acceptable class  that it be well to be transsexual than transvestite  rather than because I want it for itself  Before  I have be ashamed of my slim wrist and arm  but after I find them beautiful  so it enable me to love my body but I wish I have find some other way  For a time  it all seem to fit  I be a \u201c woman \u201d  so I felt this way  and be please to appear this way  Possibly we have the operation because doctor want to be see to be do something  or even want a subject to experiment on  I feel some people want the operation simply for itself  and should be allow to have it  In a world without patriarchy  we could know  I have fellowfeeling with radical feminist  even TERFs  They be revolt by bodymodification  and some lack any sense of proportion about trans woman  a if we be the only feminist issue they care about  but they be often masculine woman  and not fitting Patriarchy in a complementary way to me how could I not sympathise  I would put them in a group with trans folk  those who be gender nonconforming  who do not fit patriarchal view of gender  We have so much in common  it be hard that we do not work together  We be oppress by Patriarchy in such similar way  The basic phenomenon be feminine men and masculine woman  but how we respond to that be shape by the culture and our experience  I suppress it  and try to be Real Manly for year  There be transphobia  and internalise transphobia  which prevent u from flourish  We learn to be ourselves good  but still in way twist by oppression  We must build coalition and learn to resist oppression more effectively  The word you use to describe the phenomenon affect how you understand it  But we don \u2019 t understand it  not really  so we need to keep playing with the word  I would ask potential transitioners  Who be you  What would really fulfil you be it really this offthepeg solution  I would refer to \u201c gender diversity \u201d rather than trans  for \u201c genderdiverse \u201d be how people be  and \u201c trans \u201d or even \u201c gendernonconformity \u201d be choice  way to deal with the pressure of Patriarchy on gender diverse folk  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 17 \u2013 Clare
