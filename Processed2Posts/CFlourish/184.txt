"homophobia", "Quaker", "transphobia"], "text": "Transphobia be like antisemitism  people deny it exist  Just a there be clear antisemitism  like the blood libel  and justify opinion which be not  such a oppose house demolition in the Occupied Territories  there be clear transphobia and questionable opinion which be dispute  Some would say even the opinion that trans woman should not use woman \u2019 s public toilet be not transphobic  and work hard to produce the appearance of rationality and concern for the vulnerable  argue that  Perhaps trans folk would extend the definition too far  Some people have a Yuck reaction to u  As with antisemitism  many of them get selfrighteous about it  like the woman who object to the feminine presentation of trans woman  claim any feminist would find that presentation disempowers woman  a if we have the power to be fashion leader  How calm be that person  really  How far do they want to exclude u from ordinary life  What proportion of their writing concern trans woman  rather than other feminist concern  It seem to me that some people can not imagine that yuck reaction  and I wonder how I can convince them  A man in the shopping mall who have never see me before hiss \u201c f\u2013king nonce \u201d a he pass me  and I wonder what I have do that he so hat me  A group of drunk young men on the train  and one shout  \u201c Oh look  it \u2019 s a tranny \u201d  and they continue shout until they get off  Fortunately my friend be in First Class  safely apart from them  Just possibly  that might be societal transphobia rather than individual  deliberate hatred  not all of them be repel  but none stop the others from shout and perhaps they would say  \u201c But  it \u2019 s a tranny  Wouldn \u2019 t everyone shout at a tranny  \u201d if ask why they be shout  Just boisterous young men with normal animal spirit  A shopper take a second look at you  and exclaims  \u201c It \u2019 s a man  \u201d But she be just shock and surprise  and vocalise a passing thought  a anyone might stare at someone a little out of the ordinary  \u201c F\u2013king nonce  \u201d though  Calling me a sex offender  No idea who I be beyond read me a male  dress female  That \u2019 s not a normal reaction to people like me  surely  Might you believe that it be phobic  If someone I think of a a friend could imagine herself exclaim \u201c It \u2019 s a man  \u201d the first time she have see a trans woman in the street  could imagine herself feel \u201c Bless my soul \u201d level of shock  because  well  trans woman really be out of the ordinary even though perfectly acceptable could someone be my friend  chat happily with me  then say  \u201c Well  you be a bit weird  really  You aren \u2019 t normal  I don \u2019 t hold it against you  I like you  really\u2026 \u201d but me be trans be if not the elephant then the sweaty runner \u2019 s shirt in the room  which we don \u2019 t see but which insinuate itself into everyone \u2019 s nostrils\u2026 How widespread be the \u201c I be perfectly accept  but face it you be a bit weird \u201d sort of attitude  Would they say  \u201c Surely everyone \u2019 s like that  I would not shout abuse but I would notice  surely you can \u2019 t object to that  \u201d Am I too sensitive  Transphobia exist  \u201c F\u2013king nonce \u201d be an example of that  Yet friends don \u2019 t seem to realise  A man  I hear he be now in prison  he do not attend the first sentencing hearing  threaten suicide  but do attend the second a day or two after I have the misfortune to meet him  He come to the Quaker meeting once and leave after ten minute  not like the silence  Then he come a few week later just before we be about to finish  and we give him a cup of coffee  He sit in the corner  We do not start a conversation with him  nor he with u  but I take him over the cup of coffee and offer him a biscuit which he decline  People be leave  and he make no sign of want to  so I tell him we need him to leave  He object  I explain and he say  \u201c I don \u2019 t know if you \u2019 re a man or a woman \u201d and continue object  stand close to me  and wave his hand near my face  At this point people notice and come over to see what be go on  They see me in a confrontation with a man  So after he have actually leave  I explain what happen  and someone say  \u201c Well  that \u2019 s your account of it \u201d Honestly  what  It \u2019 s transphobia  Have you no memory  no gay friends  you never saw someone abuse simply because he be gay  That man could only object to me if I have do something objectionable  The EEUghH reaction  the hatred  for Jews  black people  gay  Manchester United supporters some people be prejudice and react violently you be aware it exist  right  Can you not imagine that someone might be prejudice against people like me  without any other reason  Do you sympathise with their shock or revulsion  So  you look at me  disbelievingly  without sympathy when I explain how horrible the situation have be  and how can I possibly get through to you  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 19 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
