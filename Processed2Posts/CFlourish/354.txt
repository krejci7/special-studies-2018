have do good feminist work on violence against woman  even if she be contract to speak about other issue  she could not resist a sly kick against trans woman  In The New Statesman  Sarah Ditum claim No Platform be use to silence debate  She quote Bindel  All I have ever say be question the essentialist meaning of transgenderism  because  by posit gender a fix it fly in the face of feminism  I will show this to be a lie  They see themselves a victim  The no platforming have take the form of direct intimidation \u2013 \u201c I have death threat  \u2026  I be shout at  physically attack on stage  \u201d Bindel tell me  They feel what they say and do be justified  Ditum ask trans activist Roz Kaveney for example of Bindel \u2019 s hate speech  then quote Kaveney \u2019 s tweet  \u201c I love the assumption that I have time and energy to list offensive remark by Julie Bindel  then explain why each one of them be hatespeech \u201d  \u201c Remember my past remark that one aspect of WLF  white liberal feminist  transphobia be the demand for endless unpaid access to trans people \u2019 s time  That \u201d Ditum \u2019 s sense of entitlement be so great that she still do not get it  Bindel could have tell her what have be find objectionable  and why  if she have any empathy  I find Bindel \u2019 s transphobia with ten minute on Google and Wikipedia  so Ditum could too  Ditum demand that a trans woman quote it arrogate to herself the right to judge whether Bindel \u2019 s remark be truly transphobic  I doubt Ditum would accept they be  because Ditum be also transphobic  I will quote a few  to show why they be objectionable  and give the trigger warn when I start  Bindel be unrepentant  After she be ask to comment on Caitlyn Jenner  she post on facebook  \u201c Thank you for ask  However  I do not fancy another 11 year of McCarthyite bullying  threat  no platforming  vilification  misrepresentation  false accusation  and my work on sexual violence towards woman and girl be under threat  \u201c Sorry  \u201c Feel free to use this explanation in print a to why I have choose to turn down your request \u201d I don \u2019 t want her work on sexual violence be under threat  either  Her transphobia be far less important than that work  but noplatforming mean that student body and publication be not associate with transphobia  or trans folk expose to it where we should be safe from it  Don \u2019 t bother read Ditum \u2019 s article  It do not address the argument or consider the nature of hate speech  merely vilifies and play the victim  Here be a useful article in the Guardian  \u2013 about Bindel \u2019 s transphobia  And now  the trigger warning  transphobic hate speech in the next section  trigger warning As well a Bindel \u2019 s hate speech on the radio  consider her article in Standpoint magazine  and in the Guardian  When do a leftwing feminist pander to a right wing rag like Standpoint or The Spectator  except when indulge in transphobia  Bindel play the victim in 2008  in the Guardian  There be many example of victimhood in Bindelworld  she be a dare radical treat with stagger vitriol in vicious witchhunt  In Standpoint  she say a powerful lobby affiliate with the lesbian and gay community have be hound me for five year  I don \u2019 t feel that powerful  actually  read this  and she could easily silence the demonstrator  by cease her hate speech  Here  I do not call her a monster  and I value her good work  but rather than address the reasonable argument  she complain of bully and vilification  It be wrong for a blogger to wish she would die of cancer  That be wicked  however much that blogger be hurt by transphobia  however much damage Bindel have do to trans woman  We should take the moral high ground  and not descend to her level  Bindel deliberately misrepresent  In Standpoint  she write of Russel Reid recommend surgery for someone with bodily integrity identity disorder  but do not mention that he decide against such recommendation later  Then she quote a Gender Basics definition of transgender  A definition of transsexualism use by a number of transsexual right organisation read  Students who be gender nonconforming be those whose gender expression  or outward appearance  do not follow traditional gender role  \u201c feminine boy  \u201d \u201c masculine girl \u201d and student who be androgynous  for example  It can also include student who look the way boy and girl be expect to look but participate in activity that be gender nonconforming  like a boy who do ballet  The term \u201c transgender youth \u201d can be use a an umbrella term for all student whose gender identity be different from the sex they be assign at birth andor whose gender expression be nonstereotypical  According to this definition  a girl who play football be transsexual  The definition  and the document  clearly differentiate ci  gender nonconforming children the girl who play football  the boy who do ballet from transgender youth  The document be not only support the right of transgender youth in school  but also gender nonconformists  like Bindel herself  a Bindel would surely support  However  Bindel deny the distinction  to make something sensible sound ridiculous  She then use her conflation to criticise the correct medical treatment of trans child  a if child be be refer to clinic by their parent for gender nonconformity the girl play football rather than gender identity disorder  Bindel mock that definition  for the scorn and ridicule of Standpoint fan  More mockery later  The misrepresentation continue  Feminists tend to be critical of traditional gender role because they benefit men and oppress woman  Transsexualism  by it nature  promote the idea that it be \u201c natural \u201d for boy to play with gun and girl to play with Barbie doll  The idea that gender role be biologically determine rather than socially construct be the antithesis of feminism  No  Standpoint object to u and give her a platform because we subvert traditional gender role by transition  and feeling and response associate with gender  rather than gender role  be part biological  It be misrepresentation to refer to Iran  Possibly  cis gay men there choose gender reassignment surgery rather than be stone to death  That have nothing to do with my free choice to pay for the operation in Thailand  I could easily have express myself female at work  retain my bit  have I wish to  I do  for nearly two year  It be misrepresentation to quote someone who regret the operation  and blame the doctor  Noone force u  outside Iran   She say a review find no robust scientific evidence that gender reassignment surgery be clinically effective  The weasel word there be \u201c robust \u201d  the review do not prove the matter to her satisfaction  And yet we continue live good life  grateful for our alteration  The misrepresentation matter because the whole article portray u a victim  and gay men a potential victim  of rigid cultural gender role  and the operation a a \u201c brutal \u201d \u201c mutilation \u201d forcibly conform u to those role  Rather  we be free people make free choice  respond to our own heartfelt need  The result of the misrepresentation be that Standpoint reader feel entitle to exclude u and mock u  But it would matter less without the mockery  \u2665\u2665\u2665 Bindel herself think the noplatforming start because of a 2004 Guardian article  entitle \u201c Gender Benders Beware \u201d  The very title be a slur  Trans folk be not entitle to demand The Guardian be a \u201c safe space \u201d  but they should avoid slur like that  The mockery be of the operation  MF  \u201c dispose of their meat and two veg \u201d  FM  \u201c have their breast slice off and a penis make out of their beerbellies \u201d  Both  \u201c Kwikfit sex change on offer to all and sundry \u201d  Then the notorious  those who \u201c transition \u201d seem to become stereotypical in their appearance \u2013 fuckme shoe and bird \u2019 nest hair for the boy  beard  muscle and tattoo for the girl  Think about a world inhabit just by transsexual  It would look like the set of Grease  Bindel imago there be pressure on ci gay men and lesbian to transition rather than make the gender expression they choose  She be merely paranoid  She have apologise  she tell Diva magazine I apologise unreservedly for both the tone and content of my 2004 article  Though Diva have a small circulation than the Guardian  and the Standpoint article be bad than the one for which she apologise  Here be Diva on transphobia  Thirty and forty year ago to be a lesbian be to be question  Today thing be much good for u  for the ci lesbian  that be  but there be still place where to be a lesbian be impossible  So it be for transmen and woman  many of whom have be or be lesbian or biidentified  We know something of these struggle  And just a others have support u  so we must support those among u who be trans or we risk end up on the wrong side of history  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 36 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
