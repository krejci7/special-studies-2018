but I do not have the word for it then  only the struggle and the anger  A week on a campus with Quakers be the perfect place to poke my illusion  and show me what matter to me  We be an odd lot  We like to imagine ourselves calm and wise  so avoid the appearance of conflict  and \u201c Plainspeaking \u201d  so dive into it  I like get to know people  Here be a man who have lead a committee of twenty and 125 volunteer for two year fundraise for a statue of Walton in Oldham  where Walton be bear  they have raise \u00a33000  and would have be well spend their time in menial job for the money  I join a couple walk across the campus  and when the wife go off to get coffee the husband say  \u201c Do you mind if I speak bluntly  Are you have a sex change  \u201d I could wish these people less perceptive  sometimes  They notice so quickly  One say it be obvious I wear a wig  because it be flat  not move like real hair  We be assign small group  to spend an hour together each day  but our two facilitator have not have time to discuss how they would run the group beforehand  A woman tell me she have be play croquet when \u201c this idiot \u201d come over and demand her friend go to discuss the group  Of course she refuse  I get irritated that we spend the first of our five hour together discuss how we might spend the time I want more structure but when Philip produce a conch for people to hold  so that one person would speak at a time  Peter pick it up and say he do not want to proceed in that way  Next day some be miss  We hurt  and we open  Jeff be alcoholic until he decide he have to Be Himself or die  When I say I have avoid suicide by decide that I must not hurt my father  a woman say how serendipitous the conversation be  a she seek to console her friend whose daughter have kill herself  So I share about how angry I felt about the oppression of my kind and the lack of selfworth we feel  and how liberating transition is like move from monochrome to technicolor  During the week  I go to Leicester to consult with Dr Khoosal  a psychiatrist  I need a second opinion so I could have my penectomy and vaginoplasty  He tell me I be not ready  I need laser treatment to remove my pubic hair and speech therapy  He think I should not have testosterone suppression  Until I sort all this out I could not have the Op  When I finally bring myself to open his letter week later  I find he recommend surgery  he have see my distress  and change his mind  However I leave Leicester unable to express my misery or anger  I curl in a ball on the floor  and my friend cover me with a blanket  I meet a woman who have transition ten year before  She tell me that she have put transition behind her and be simply a normal woman an enviable state  I think  Then she moan about her wife and about transition experience  she still felt the same anger  I ask a solicitor in the Blue Group what be the effect of a decree nisi without a decree absolute after ten year  and she reveal she be the trans woman \u2019 s daughter  Despite all my sharing  she have not think to tell me before  Before transition  I have love country dance  I could get high on movement  music  touch and eyecontact  I travel to Germany in a demonstration team  Now  try it in an afternoon session  I get angry with the others bodging  and laugh at their mistake and ungainliness this can be so much more  Worse  I be embarrass and uncomfortable dancing on the man \u2019 s side  and confuse on the woman \u2019 s  I leave early  On the Friday evening I dance in the closing Ceilidh  Yes  I see other people be enjoy themselves  and still feel angry  So I go to find Anthea  the healer  We go into the deserted Hazlerigg ballroom  This Healing stuff really be ridiculous mumbojumbo but have nowhere else to go  I go along with it  She place me in a golden circle of light  so that only the high and fine energy may come through it  then ask me to focus on my chakras  what colour can I see  None  I do not have a mind \u2019 s eye  We both insist  and eventually I give up  pick red  Can I imagine my coccyx extend downwards to root in Mother Gaia  No  I try to extend it  and it pull back  The base chakra be tribe and family  or root  Sit on the ground to root but I can not trust  I express my anger  not at Dr Khoosal  I be plead with him  how do you diagnose  Can you not see I be female  Have you any idea how I feel  Then I be back at my mother \u2019 s death bed  I look down on you with the foam on your lip and scream at you  What do you mean you still have work to do  Did I ever smile  Did you ever smile at me or touch me  I hear the Carpers at the back of my head  There be three of them  The first be like a baby  I can pick him up and cuddle him  The second have chalk and a blackboard  to teach me  Anthea say I should help him write out his feeling  then burn the paper  The third be a mass of energy  a black hole destroy light  She say nothing  I try to touch her hand  to make friend a with a cat in the garden  I need to integrate  love  and calm these aspect of myself  Anthea suggest I have a shower and go to bed  and in the shower I find myself channel heal energy through my hand  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 43 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
