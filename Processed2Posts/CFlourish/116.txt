that refers to Patriarchal repression  She  who fight for academic achievement almost entirely reserve for men  saw the repression at it most powerful  Judith Butler interpret that quote  If be a woman be one cultural interpretation of be female  and if that interpretation be in no way necessitate by be female  then it appear that the female body be the arbitrary locus of the gender \u2018 woman \u2019  and there be no reason to preclude the possibility of that body become the locus of other construction of gender  At it limit  then  the sexgender distinction imply a radical heteronomy of natural body and construct gender with the consequence that \u2018 be \u2019 female and \u2018 be \u2019 a woman be two very different sort of be  This be a way to freedom  to imagine that have a particular appearance should not constrain either the gift you be expect to have  or the way you develop and embody them  If the word \u201c woman \u201d oppress those it do not fit  cast it off  You might later reclaim it  define it not by \u201c feminine \u201d quality but by a common experience of oppression  I share that oppression  I have be sexually assault a if my body belong to the man  to use a he please  As Poppy Noor say  when talk of sexual assault men ask  cautiously and very sympathetically  whether this have happen to me\u2026 woman swap story and countertactics  Woman  then  be a social group suffer particular oppression  share an interest in fight it  Butler find freedom by escape the woman gender  If \u2018 exist \u2019 one \u2019 s gender mean that one be tacitly accept or rework cultural norm govern the interpretation of one \u2019 s body  then gender can also be a place in which the binary system restrict gender be itself subvert  Through new formulation of gender  new way of amalgamate and subvert the opposition of \u2018 masculine \u2019 and \u2018 feminine \u2019  the establish way of polarize gender becomes increasingly confuse  and binary opposition come to oppose itself  Her solution be not to become a woman  She use genetics to far this aim  And what be \u201c sex \u201d anyway  Is it natural  anatomical  chromosomal  or hormonal  and how be a feminist critic to assess the scientific discourse which purport to establish such \u201c fact \u201d for u  \u2026 If the immutable character of sex be contest  perhaps this construct call \u201c sex \u201d be a culturally construct a gender  indeed  perhaps it be always already gender  with the consequence that the distinction between sex and gender turn out to be no distinction at all  For her  the concept of the gender binary affect how scientist without the insight afford by feminist philosophy classify intersex people  and how they hypothesise about sex difference  There be no specifically female or feminine virtue  We make Rudyard Kipling inclusive What be more  you \u2019 ll be a person  my child  We extend his promise to those designate \u201c woman \u201d  Yours be the World  and everything that \u2019 s in it  Carl Rogers write \u201c On Becoming a Person \u201d  everyone be affect by nature  nurture and environment  throughout life  Extracts from Judith Butler  Arguably  a a trans woman  my Judith Butler quote do me no good  By transition I be assert that my feminine virtue fit a female body and female presentation  that there be a gender binary  However  I be reject the role of oppressor  and beg to be grant a space with the oppressed I be an asylum seeker  not a colonist and reject the idea that be \u201c born a man \u201d specify quality I have  or ought to have  Mine be the way to radical freedom if I may \u201c become a woman \u201d anyone who do not wish to need not  Butler herself seek to listen to trans and intersex community and include u  If \u2018 queer \u2019 mean that we be generally people whose gender and sexuality be \u2018 unfixed \u2019 then what room be there in a queer movement for those who understand themselves a require \u2013 and want \u2013 a clear gender category within a binary frame  \u2026It be a fundamental issue of how to establish and insist upon those form of address that make life liveable  At issue as well be a question of autonomy  conceptualize not through individualism  but a an emergent social phenomenon  how do I name myself  how can I establish my status within the law or within medical institution  and to what extent will my desire to live a a particular gender or within an establish gender category be honour by those who claim to ally with me  For me  that my gender do not fit my birth sex be sufficient to make me \u201c queer \u201d  oppress  and resist oppression  that should be enough to make me an ally of all others resist it  Anyone who attack me a an oppressor or seek to defend other oppressed people from me be do the oppressor \u2019 s work  Don \u2019 t fight me  I be not the problem  To put it another way  here be JFK  lightly make inclusive  Freedom be indivisible  and when
