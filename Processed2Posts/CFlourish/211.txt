\u2019 s care  where he develop normal boyish interest  These demonstrate the harmfulness of the mother and the rightness of the rescue  That be the story you get from Mr Justice Hayden  who order the new care arrangement  It justify greatly restrict the contact the mother have with the child they must be supervise  How would the mother  refer to a \u201c M \u201d to preserve anonymity  get her child J to wear a pink headband and nail varnish  leave alone present entirely female  unless J be a trans girl  Why would she  CAFCASS  the child and family court advisory support service  investigate  and recommend that F  ather  not have contact with the child  a it would cause M and J \u201c potential emotional harm \u201d  Social service have anonymous referral say M be mentally ill and that J might access the skunk M smoke in front of him  The social service child and family assessment  complete in January 2015  conclude that there be no evident concern suggest that  J  be at immediate risk of harm   M  be very clear that she be support  J  with whatever choice  J  make and she present with a good understanding of  J  \u2019 s need  There be no concern from the social worker regard  M  \u2019 s approach to  J  \u2019 s gender presentation  and have appropriately take on board support from the charity Mermaids  Upon completion of the assessment  no further action be take by Children \u2019 s Services  The judge find this irrational and unsustainable  and draw attention to the school \u2019 concern  that  J  behave no differently than the other child but they felt that  M  be unwilling to accept this and on occasion she reduce a teacher to tear due to her \u2018 forceful and confrontational \u2019 manner\u2026in class   J  doesn \u2019 t display any difference to the other boy  What constitute \u201c difference \u201d  Who judge  and what be their expectation  If J try to conform in any situation  rather than follow his own unconstrained wish  what will he do  One referral to social service say M be unwilling to accept help from local child mental health service  The judge condemn social service strongly  say the cry for investigation go unheeded  Social service combine both naivety and professional arrogance  However  social service report those concern be in relation to  J  presenting a a girl rather than concern in relation  J  \u2019 s welfare and the care that be provide to  J  \u2026the manner in which  J  \u2019 s gender identity be respond to by professional could also cause emotional difficulty  a have be evidence in research around gender non conform child cite earlier  It appear that  M  be genuinely attempt to protect  J  from the impact of this  M have access support from the Tavistock Centre  the child gender identity service  The judgment show no evidence from them  only from psychologist  The first  Jean Sambrooks  refers to J a \u201c she \u201d  but the judge dismiss this  though he say that It be entirely counterintuitive to suspect that a boy who be consistently present a a girl may not truly wish to do so and may have be force or induce into perform such a role by his mother  He draw attention to her concern about the way M communicate  though Ms Sambrooks consider that the impact of these concern be most likely to have alienate professional to the mother \u2019 s genuine concern  The judge find M highly manipulative and control with strong opinion  prone to exaggerate and distort  even \u201c oppositional \u201d  A mother defend a trans child from disbelief might need such quality  He say As I have hear this case I have note that these illogicality often characterise M \u2019 s evidence  Nobody have doubt that M be both articulate and intelligent and so the reasonable inference be that she must recognise some of the illogicality of her own statement  I consider that she have learn that by create \u2018 confusion \u2019  to use Ms Sambrooks \u2019 word  amongst the professional  she generate a situation in which her own distorted belief gain great traction and be able to prevail with less effective challenge  There be delay  which the judge report be cause by M \u2019 s unjustified challenge of lawyer involve  and refusal to communicate  The family court transfer the case to the high court because lack of information of the child \u2019 s whereabouts raise concern for his welfare  In November 2015 Mr Justice Hayden make a variety of highly prescriptive order  reinforce by a Penal Notice  J  then five  be live in stealth  all the time present a a girl and register at the GP a a girl  M say the Tavistock centre have advise this  but the judge say Though I be by no mean certain  I very much doubt that the Tavistock would have give this advice in respect of such a very young child  I be amazed noone ask them  Instead  the judge seek their file  There be a hearing before Mr Justice Hayden where he order that J be deliver to F He portray M a control  What be perfectly clear however and require emphasis be that M be determine that J should live entirely a a girl  At only five year of age that do not strike me a offer J choice or even the opportunity to express any ambivalence or confusion  I be also entirely satisfy that whatever choice J make and however he present  he would be love and care for and his choice respect in F \u2019 s care  The February hearing be very stressful for M However what strike me forcibly  both then and indeed at this final hearing  be that M speak of J only in the somewhat opaque and convoluted argot of social work and psychology  She offer an impressive  intense and highly articulate evaluation of the problem face by child with gender dysphoria but she convey no sense of J \u2019 s personality  temperament or enthusiasm  notwithstanding frequently be encourage to do so  Repeatedly she strike me a a professional witness give evidence about somebody else \u2019 s child  I be also leave in no doubt that M be absolutely convinced that J perceive himself a a girl  M \u2019 s case on this point have not always be either consistent or coherent  but my overwhelming impression be that she believe herself to be fight for J \u2019 s right to express himself a a girl  She have tell me how J \u2018 express disdain for his penis \u2019  I think it accurately summarise her position to say that she perceive it to be her responsibility in the face of widespread public  professional and indeed judicial ignorance to promote J \u2019 s choice of gender  Why on Earth would M want to manipulate a child who be not trans into present a a trans girl  The judge do not say  How could she do that  There be societal pressure on boy to present culturally male  but the judge do not consider that  however he be sure the child be not trans  I be entirely satisfy  both on the basis of the report and F \u2019 s evidence at this hearing  that he have bring no pressure on J to pursue masculine interest  J \u2019 s interest and energy be entirely self motivate  Ms Sambrooks note it would seem that  J  be very used to touch  M  \u2019 s breast and that she have afford him considerable knowledge or discussion of genital anatomy  Whilst this may reflect  M  \u2019 s view of  J  \u2019 s gender issue it be not in my view appropriate knowledge nor would a child of  J  \u2019 s age  transgendered or not  generally have such discussion  At most they be likely to have a rudimentary awareness of malefemale difference especially if bring up with a different sex sibling  There be more in the judgment indicate J be a boy  freely choose to express a a boy  and not pressure by his father  Ms Sambrooks find that M  powerful and manipulative  influenced J \u2019 s gender presentation  Now J be with his father  M and her solicitor produce a response indicate she might have be wrong  She deny word have be put into her mouth  but she would not have say this without external pressure just the removal of her child be pressure  She accept the wisdom of the court in reintroduce  J  to his father and the paternal family  She accept and understand why the Judge have form a negative view of her refusal to allow contact firstly and secondly her dogmatic stance in respect of gender identity  Her dilemma be that whilst she hop she have be do the right thing she accept that her approach may have be wrong\u2026her initial reaction be disbelief  anger and a sense of injustice and unfairness  but above all a deep fear and anxiety of the impact upon  J  of move in such circumstance  The decision have however make her reexamine her own action and the position she have take in recent year  The judge find this disingenuous  Dr Kate Hellin  consultant clinical psychologist  find an \u201c enmeshed relationship \u201d between M and J  \u201c Enmeshment refers to an extreme form of proximity and intensity in family interactions\u2026In a highly enmesh  overinvolved family  change within one family member or in the relationship between two family member reverberate throughout the system\u2026On an individual level  interpersonal differentiation in an enmeshed system be poor\u2026In enmeshed family the individual get lose in the system  The boundary that define individual autonomy be so weak that function in individually differentiate way be radically handicap \u201d  Minuchin  1978  16 describe how enmeshment varies in degree  with correspond degree of negative impact on child development  The enmeshed or fused nature of the relationship between  M  and  J  be show in the way that she do not clearly perceive  J  a a separate person with hisher own identity  wish and volition  She sometimes confuse her own feeling with  J  \u2019 s  For example  she believe  J  to have be bully at school  though the school do not agree   M  herself be bully at school and she be also in a conflictual relationship with the school  one in which she may have be both bully and felt bully  Similarly  she say that  J  be afraid of go to the GP practice and would scream there but surgery staff have never see this  Again  this be at a time that  M  be in conflict with the surgery  She believe  J  prefer \u201c just mummy and me \u201d and she apparently end a relationship in order to focus on  J  though it be not clear to me why the relationship be in conflict with her role a mother  If I be correct about the fused nature of the relationship  the danger be that  J  will not be easily able to establish an identity which be at odds with  M  \u2019 s own value  belief and preference  It will be hard for himher to separate and individuate with age and especially in his or her teen  This will apply to  J  \u2019 s gender identity  The fused nature of the relationship and  M  \u2019 s belief that  J  want to be a girl be likely to push  J  in the direction of a female gender identity   M  can not see that  J  may be consciously or unconsciously try to please her by assume a female gender identity now that  M  have form the view that this be  J  \u2019 s preference  Her wish for emotional exclusivity mean that  M  have remove  J  from a range of ordinary socialising experience though she refute this and believe that she have act to protect  J  from bully  When stressed and distressed   M  become control  forceful and antagonistic  This reflect her underlying anxiety  She be actually very frightened and upset  She try to sooth herself by take control of situation but her interpersonal style be counterproductive  She do not negotiate well  She find it difficult to compromise and situations become inflamed rather than deescalated  In situation of interpersonal conflict  she protect herself from loss of confidence or face by unambiguously perceive herself a correct which mean that from her perspective  the other party be wrong  To acknowledge her flaw  even to herself  feel crush and devastate her selfesteem so she avoid this possibility by locate responsibility and blame elsewhere  When she be unable to achieve the outcome that she want  she resort to formal process andor high authority  complaint procedure  The Protection of Human Rights in Public Law  the European Court of Human Rights  Stonewall and so on  The judge summarises  Dr Hellin clarify that M do not suffer from any disorder of personality or psychiatric condition  M be  Dr Hellin say  lock into a rigid and unshakeable belief structure  It be not likely to change nor be it receptive to therapy  In a way that I have notice before  M only take the positive from this opinion in order to harness them for her own argument  Of course Dr Hellin \u2019 s prognosis be extremely bleak  I be convince that on an intellectual level M understand this but emotionally she appear to reject it  He say  M have traduce F and belittle him throughout the course of this litigation  at time  quite literally  snort with derision  The judge considers that contact with M distress J  and that she lead him to say he be a girl though he would not unprompted  After see her  he wet the bed  Clutching at straw here  I imagine it possible that the child think present female  which she want more than anything else  be impossible  so she could only maintain equanimity by blot out the possibility  but the mother force her to consider it  yet I don \u2019 t think that be the case  I be convince by the judgment that the mother have manipulate the child  I have meet such control mother  I have one  Mermaids  the charity for trans child  would not necessarily see this side of her  if they support and accept her view and her child \u2019 s apparent desire  I have some trust in the system  Some professional consider J be a girl  with gender dysphoria  others consider he be not  The professional  and even the judge  seem not merely to discount the possibility but to consider the evidence and their own assessment  My only doubt come from doubt the judge \u2019 s fitness to practice  But  he say  My experience in the Family Division leave me with little doubt that some child  as young a 4  5  6 year of age may identify strongly with their opposite gender  Such child can experience rejection and abuse arise from ignorance both on a personal and institutional level  Though none of the party refer me to it  I have read the House of Commons Select Committee report \u2018 Transgender Equality \u2019  date 14th January 2016  which investigate the challenge in secure sensitive NHS care and access affirm educational environment for transgender adult and child  It be important that such child be listen to and their view afford respect but  to my mind  they be ill serve by premature labelling  The judge anticipate a happy end  I form the impression that he have not reach an absolute conclusion that J will continue to identify a a boy  though he think this the more likely outcome  This strike me a neatly illustrate Dr Hellin \u2019 s view that F be a \u2018 moderate \u2019 person able to \u2018 countenance\u2026uncertainty \u2019  F \u2019 s simple and instinctive position be that he love his son unconditionally and will continue to do so however he turn out  F have  in his quiet  selfeffacing manner show remarkable resilience in extremely try circumstance  He work with increase confidence with the agency who have let him and his son down so badly and he do so without bitterness or rancour  Throughout the entirety of the private law proceeding F \u2019 s character be traduce  he be excise from his child \u2019 s life  his concern be not listen to by the professional involve in the case  Many father in such circumstance would have walk away  He do not  he stand by his son throughout the seemingly endless proceeding and be ultimately able to rescue him  He have now earn the respect of all the professional involve in this case to whose voice I add my own  Social Services consider F be a good father and they need not take parental responsibility  but the judge require their involvement  He decide that J would be hurt if he could not see his mother  but M may harm him by her incorrigible insistence that he be a girl  He propose monthly supervise contact  J have two very intelligent parent  F \u2019 s empathy and sensitivity enable him to offer his son a great deal  M \u2019 s lively and creative mind  her sense of fun and her powerful capacity to express herself be also gift from which her son may derive very great benefit  Whilst Dr Hellin maybe right in her bleak prognosis about M \u2019 s capacity to change  human nature can be remarkably resourceful and resilient  The Family Courts sometimes see change in human behaviour which confound expert expectation  I hope for J \u2019 s sake that this be such a case  Transphobes will take comfort from this case  Seeing a case where a mother have manipulate her child into transition  they will claim that all parent of trans child be like that  That be ridiculous  Parents often resist the child \u2019 s desire to present crossgender  eventually the child \u2019 s insistence force the parent to listen  However the position be not as simple a trans advocate might wish  Some parent really be that manipulative  Bertrand Russell  When you be study any matter  or consider any philosophy  ask yourself only what be the fact and what be the truth that the fact bear out  Never let yourself be divert either by what you wish to believe  or by what you think would have beneficent social effect if it be believe  But look only  and solely  at what be the fact  The judgment  This be what the newspaper have to say  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 22 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
