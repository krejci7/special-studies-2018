construct of patriarchy  a trap set by the culture which do not fit the speaker so she can not imagine that it fit any woman  woman who pretend to it need their consciousness raise  and trans \u201c woman \u201d be tool of patriarchy  I be not \u201c feminine \u201d  what I think of as feminine in me be weak  sick  pervert  disgust  ridiculous  illusory  misogynist  When I be just me  in a carefree manner  my reaction be just So Wrong  I try to be something else  some stereotype masculinity  but be simply inadequate  My feeling be anger  resentment  frustration and fear  I have retreat to my living room  and I despise myself for it  It be Ridiculous  Weak  This journey take so long  I accept my femininity  It be real  me  how I react when I do not police myself  Yet I be still stick here  in my flat  fritter my life  exist  because I do not want to do anything else  I do not have access to my desire  beyond a desire to hide away  Again I despise myself for that  It be a complete waste of all my life  so many experience I have not have  always  hiding I accept my femininity  Oh God  I think of her a a man  I hate that  I judge her  her tight red dress be not appropriate for her age or the place  her wig be poor  her face be so masculine  I feel  and these be bad thing  Judgements of others be projection of thing about which I feel uncomfortable in myself the measure you give will be the measure you get\u2013 so I learn of my shame from this encounter  It be deep  She be kind to me  a feminine characteristic  I talk of my job interview  and she tell me of interview  how she be look for a person whose character fit  rather than the attribute the person might think matter  She be be reassure in that deep  husky  soft voice  Kind  Sweet  We hug  I can accept others if I can accept myself  Well  here be I in a dress where woman would be in trouser  It be what I want to wear  We be all in skirt and dress  well  we be hyperfeminine  or we would sortof be able to make a go of present male  I be at the Positively Trans workshop  tunnel towards something positive through all the shit  look at shame and stigma  and I realise I have not just be ashamed of be feminine  but also of be submissive sexually  and of my Performance side  I be sing on Sunday at the Quaker garden party  I be belt it out  know my voice be strain and I be not hit all the notes for I have not practise my performance skill  the inclination be there  possibly even the talent  but my shame have eat it  and I have be reserve  suppress myself  This may be why after perform I often get a very low mood  it be back to ordinary life  All that shame  then in my daily Spiritual Practice email I get  Your past be not your potential  In any hour you can choose to liberate the future  And I think fuck you  Not more Work  \u2665\u2665\u2665 It be wonderful to be in this loving  supportive environment  I express myself strongly  and others relate to what I say  I be a recluse  I have withdraw from the world others relate to that  My shame bound me in iron  unable to express myself naturally  and even now those bond feel like protection\u2013 when I take them off I feel vulnerable  yet then I be real  free  truthful  enable to feel  The bond whisper to me  you be pretend  you be not like that really  we be your True Self but I know they be Wrong  I be bully  control  erasedTheir concept of me be superimpose on me  the real me ignore and devalue  The psychologist start to riff  talk enthusiastically  It be beautiful  I write it down hungrily  experience be rich and complex  full of emotion and pain That be what I first notice  and write  so I ask him to repeat himself full of desire  want  need  yearnings\u2026 JOY\u2026 Yes  It be hard to be outside the binary  It take courage  I would stare at someone as feminine a you say my friend in Linlithgow  I don \u2019 t see you a male or female  I see you a you say more than one person  attempt reassurance  But it be how I see myself that matter  whether I restrict myself in my bond  my false protection  or step outside them a I realise  delightedly  I have do walk through Winchester to my job interview  I do not tourist the cathedral  but near it I saw a bust of a man who \u201c save it with his bare hand \u201d  So I ask a woman what that mean  and she say it have be subside  so in the late 19th century he excavate underneath it  support it with masonry  and it have not move since  We share our admiration of him  This be what I do  I make connection with people  I dig into my shame  and saw it be not just around be feminine  but be submissive  and dramatic  too  see my father who could not admit these thing  It make me feel inadequate and disgust  It make me very careful  never spontaneous  born middleaged  I cop by try to follow the Ideal I be force into  and suppress my feeling  I be make to feel bad by my parent because of their fear of Society and of me  they be try to protect me  I say to the group  I be submissive  I felt no shame  It felt wonderfully liberate  Are these experience still affect you  I be reclusive  I have no experience of be submissive in relationship  little experience of performance  and though I take my opportunity on Sunday I be wary I overdo it  I have not make my opportunity  I be still careful and reserve  It be a long journey out of shame  First I hide and repress myself  Now I focus on this be who I be  I seek support from friend and Charing Cross  Suppressing the shame will not work  but pride be a useful antidote  I feel shame at deception  I be reveal my Self  but others feel I be hide my maleness unless I be project again  Laugh at shame  Contact with trans people increase pride in trans identity  Love  acceptance and compassion be the best antidote to shame  along with community  visibility  recognition by others  Consider how I would respond to another  I be always harder on myself  Practise metta  If I can acknowledge my pain and difficulty I can celebrate my struggle  To get where I be I have be brave  truthful and determine  When aware of my feeling I be well able to cope with how they affect me  I can choose my own identity  The answer be Love  \u2665\u2665\u2665 Through the negativity to something positive and beautiful\u2026 Four year ago  I awake at war  There be my negative  meanspirited self  and there be a positive  good way of see thing  love drive out fear  The point of the seminar at Charing Cross be move through the negative to something positive  I realise at the seminar that my bond of shame do not only discount and reject my femininity  but also my submissive sexuality and my dramatic way of present myself  I hide myself away and pretend to be other  and eventually this grow so painful that I have hide away in my flat  Negative  I have waste my life  pretend to be something else  and my hiding be weak Positive  I have be on a spiritual journey of selfdiscovery and selfacceptance  and now  on the cusp of selfacceptance  I be liberate  I have all the time I need to be myself  The hiding be the best I could do  I have always do my best  I can develop that beautifully dramatic persona  I can be free  a me  Or the job interview  Negative  I don \u2019 t know that I want it or could do it but be terrify of have my benefit cut  My answer to that one question be completely dreadful\u2026 Positive  With these people  I be truly myself  We spend ninety minute together  show their valuing me  plus a tour of the meeting house  Winchester be beautiful and the meeting house peaceful  though I saw two people sit in sleep bag by the side of the street  I could do that job  They think my account of my Quakerism  in particular of be clerk  spot on  Yes it be disappoint not to get the job  There will be others  So  the seminar  lead by a psychologist  a gay man use his own research  He be lovely  1  of the population be gendervariant  Through our value and the dominant culture  we tend to think of binary rather than spectrum  The exercise bring out decided answer in me  What identities do you have in your life parent  sibling  gaystraight etc  I be Abigail  I be Me Anything else be too painful  I be Abigail  or I be deadgrey  not want anything but to hide  Which of these identity be gendered  Me be definitely gendered  feminine  Who choose these identity  Do you like them  I choose Nothing  I be myself  or I be force into the deadgrey  initially by my mother and now by my shame and fear  I be myself  or I resist myself  I like Myself  How do you identify in term of gender
