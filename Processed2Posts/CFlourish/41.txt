and I know I have to transition  But what be this \u201c Man \u201d I be reject  It be the idea of masculinity I have take in from my family  the wider culture and individual interaction with people  Underneath it be a Real Me  rebel and subvert it  so that I be at war with myself  I imagine myself manly  and take action to develop that  I join the territorial army  Why do they not send me to the District Assessment Board  Because I be \u201c insufficiently military \u201d  This do not mean that woman could not be army officer  I tell a female officer I would be attend  and then later that I would not  hold back tear  Tears would certainly not have be military  and she acknowledge that effort while distance herself I have be a possible friend  and be now a private  What else  The army be the myth I pick on  Walking the Lairig Ghru  perhaps  and back by the Lairig anLaoigh  I be at risk  and should not have do it alone  at the end  I be exhaust  I have to ford a stream where the plank bridge have be wash away  wad thigh deep in fast flowing  cold water  I do not know what the Ordnance Survey map symbol for \u201c cliff \u201d meant  so clamber down rock  twist the frame of Trefor \u2019 s rucksack  I be OK  I manage  I feel that selfreliance be a good thing which need not be gendered  and I cop with the challenge I have not anticipate  I don \u2019 t know where I be with that  proud of do it  not sure about the instinct which drive me to it  which could be an idea of manhood and my own failure to live up to it  bully myself or develop myself  Developing myself be good  I want to keep fit  and settle for swim about a mile three time a week  I could enjoy the effort  Everyone should exercise  Interactions with others it be so instinctive  How could I know  now  or read from memory what be go on  What I think at the time and what I would think now support my idea and desire  When I start in Perthshire  I write in my diary  \u201c I can not endure this job  I must enjoy it \u201d I do not understand the world  any more than anyone else in his early twenty  I know more three decade on  It seem that the \u201c manhood \u201d be one part of my be  who I think I have to be to fit in with society  and my femininity be unconscious  manifest itself in my behaviour despite attempt to control it but not acknowledge or value  see a weakness and failure  I have two model to understand this  Picking on two part of the self oversimplifies  but the model do and I feel they map on to each other fairly well  and to my Masculine Ideal v Feminine Reality  Richard Rohr  mystic contemplative  favour the unconscious self which come into consciousness a we age  the Reality which I have to transition to unearth  Life and God ask u to let go of our false self\u2014the passing  egoic identity we \u2019 ve manufacture in order to cope and survive  To be free from selfpreoccupation  we must be center in the Real  our inherent and unbreakable identity a God \u2019 s beloved  Once we \u2019 re connect to our Source  we know that our isolated  seemingly inferior or superior individual self be not that big a deal  The more we cling to selfimportance and ego  the more we be undoubtedly live outside of union  Steve Peters favour the ideal self which you consciously imagine yourself to be  Unusually  he give his academic title on his book cover \u201c Prof \u201d  to give himself credibility  Do you sabotage your own happiness and success  Are you struggle to make sense of yourself  Do your emotion sometimes dictate your life  Yes  yes and yes  but I have to let them  a try to impose that ideal which I come to consciously be torture me  He want to give the ideal the power to control the emotional  unconscious part underneath  which he call the \u201c Inner Chimp \u201d  The book cover quote \u201c Sir \u201d Chris Hoy  The mind programme that help me win my Olympic Golds  The Inner Chimp  laziness and the inability to defer gratification  give way to an ideal of devotion to training and mastery  Possibly make a crude identification Feminine Reality equal God \u2019 s Beloved equal Inner Chimp get in the way  Rohr have see the beauty and wonder of the Human part  which he find underlying  and Peters the beauty and wonder of the conscious understanding  which he want to develop  Peters want the Chimp on board  and the person find goal which the whole person support  Certainly some people find the negotiation between the two easy than others  I find it particularly difficult  I feel see the wonder  good and beauty in both part would help  I need to understand  value and reconcile both  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 5 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
