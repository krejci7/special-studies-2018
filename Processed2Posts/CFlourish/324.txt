homophobia and racism in trans activism \u201d and publicise a vast number of reblogs from TERFs six on 22 December alone  Normally they publish just the start of a post  but publish the whole of a study of outcome of transition from 2011  \u201c Genderwipesthefingerprints \u201d give a very short introduction say  sex reassignment be positively correlate with a far high risk of death and a great number of suicide attempt  Tragic stuff  Correlated in part because of the hate spread by her site  and the study can not say how we would fare without GRS  The study find 804 diagnose with Gender Identity Disorder  of whom 380 have GRS and change the gender indicator on their National Registration Number  NRN   between 1973 and 2003  Death and morbidity be not significantly great in the first ten year  but be  after  As the \u201c Discussion \u201d in the study note  the overall mortality rate be only significantly increase for the group operate before 1989  However  the latter might also be explain by improved health care for transsexual person during 1990s  along with altered societal attitude towards person with different gender expression  Bad news for the TERFs  then  there be less hate  and for u  hate kill  After 2004  the NRN cease to record gender  So  a bit of gloat and a misleading introduction from Stop Trans Chauvinism  The study also indicate the tiny number with gender dysphoria  why be the TERFs so obsess with u  A good introduction to the study be here  Headline  Do trans activist realise they enable this kind of misogyny and self hatred  The \u201c selfhatred \u201d consist of refer to breast a \u201c gross chest tumor \u201d and to the vagina a the \u201c rape gash \u201d  But 4thwavenow be quote a comment by a trans man  That \u2019 s not misogyny and selfhatred  but gender dysphoria  We hate our physical sex characteristic  That \u2019 s what the diagnosis mean  The person quote be forty  well able to make up his own mind  4thwavenow be the mother of a teenager who formerly identify a FtM  but have decide against transition  She ask  Why wouldn \u2019 t someone who actually care about \u201c trans \u201d people celebrate a teenager who win \u2019 t have to endure year of injection and surgery  It would be like a cancer patient become enrage when another patient go into remission  No  it would be like a cancer patient enrage when another patient refuse treatment  I can \u2019 t know whether 4thwavenow \u2019 s child will transition later in life whether the gender dysphoria be a passing teenage phase  or a matter of identity which the mother have reject  to the child \u2019 s last harm  But neither can she  \u201c Stop Trans Chauvinism \u201d  or the laughing TERFs reading that bullshit  I always seek common ground with the most extreme hater  and here I find a link to Antiporn feminist  I too be opposed to pornography  because of the risk of STD and physical damage to woman whose penetration be depict  as well a the objectification of woman  but the post link be a quote  a slab of text from The Colour of Pomegranates  a \u201c radical feminism marxism \u201d blog  In postmodernity  pornography be just another \u201c text \u201d represent another narrative that no compete narrative can claim superiority over \u2026If reality  truth and meaning be socially construct  van Zon  2013  then it make sense that the reality that pornography be detrimental can be obscure  So what  Postmodernity and Postmodernism be therefore a bad thing  Opposition to pornography can not continue  I use postmodern thoughtprocesses  I oppose pornography  I be inconsistent again  so what  And  feminine and masculine expression be socially construct too  Postmodernism be an essential feminist tool  On antiporn feminist  I find this comment  the automatic response from most people be to dismiss you a an antisex prude  Is it  I hear the feeling of be a beleaguered minority  be that how it really be  and do that contribute to the TERFs \u2019 vehemence and hatred against u  Most people accept me a an honorary woman  Maria Miller MP  chair of the Women and Equalities committee inquiry into trans people  say  \u201c What have be most shocking be to hear the personal experience of trans people who have have almost have to accept the unacceptable  which be daytoday abuse on the street by member of the public shouting at them  and almost have to accept that be part of their life  \u201d she say  \u201c That be not acceptable \u201d Take heart  Powerful voice support u  Changing  today  from El Greco to Raphael  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 33 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
