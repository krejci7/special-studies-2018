do the BBC have to say about genderqueer or genderfluid folk  Here be Analysis  I be neither a man or a woman  Whoah  we can hear you thinking what \u2019 s go on  Not me  of course  I be think  Testify  People who identify a nonbinary feel they fall outside those malefemale category  They also might identify a transgender\u2026  this be a movement with traction  especially in the West  among the young  The concept of nonbinary challenge pretty much everyone \u2019 s thinking  Prepare to throw some of your assumption about gender out of the window  I paraphrase throughout  Tamsin  AMAB  consider transition to female  but it do not seem quite right  until they saw the term \u201c nonbinary \u201d on line  which immediately make sense  It mean freedom from expectation  You \u2019 ll have to get use to pronouns  Often people with a nonbinary identity prefer something genderneutral  Grammarians might disapprove of use \u201c they \u201d a singular  but please take a deep breath and go with u on this journey  Linda Pressly  presenter  understands and sympathises  but imagine none of the audience will  which irk me  Tamsin be take female hormone  so their feature have soften and they have the beginning of a bust line  It be a choice  Intensely personal detail be pass on  The advantage be that some in the audience might sympathise more with a person than the abstract \u201c some people take hormone \u201d  but others might hear a freak show  Is that my own transphobia speaking \u201c They will see u a freak  \u201d  I be still uncomfortable  People still read Tamsin a male  female  or a trans woman  not a nonbinary  Kate Bornstein write \u201c Gender Outlaw \u201d in the early 1990s  I always think of KB a a trans woman  indeed that most nonbinary people be AFAB  Linda correct me  then reveal their surgical status  Kate  I be spend time with transsexual  and be accept a neither  Linda  A legitimacy of sort have come for those who transition from one gender to another  There be still violent prejudice but gender affirmation surgery  well on the word than I be   have become more common  and trans woman and trans men be far more visible  Kate  Miley Cyrus say she be not man  not woman  Many find the identity on line  Tumblr be an influential site  JenJack  a researcher  use the pronoun he and she  Everyone under 30 have be on Tumblr  affect by surgery picture  People try out level of masculinity and femininity  I be a tomboy  I have a male persona call Tom when I be two or three  I don \u2019 t want to be what \u2019 s know a a girl  Finn be 16  Their mum fear how the world would react  but now celebrate that Finn can be themself  The Tavistock Clinic for under18s  Linda  They may be prescribe hormoneblockers give them a space to explore their gender  They may take crossgender hormone  Some may want surgery  I object  Linda do not state how rare this be  The number of referral have increase tenfold  1400 be see last year  Girls outnumber boy two to one  She mean \u201c AFAB outnumber AMAB \u201d  Polly Carmichael  the director  say  The nonbinary group be challenge assumption  Transition be a welldeveloped pathway in the UK health system  but nonbinary challenge preconceived idea  Some want hormone but not surgery  There be a develop language we be all learn along the way  It be not a matter of need to prove anything  Many seek no medical intervention  but bind their breast  Linda  If Finn be your child  how would you feel about them take testosterone or have chest surgery  Finn \u2019 s mother when she hear \u201c cry and cry and cry \u201d but six month on find herself in a different place  Finn  No parent want surgery for their child  but a with any surgery there be an issue that need to be fix  I can feel comfortable in my body  first binding and then know that within five year I win \u2019 t have breast  Alok  We experience discrimination at work  physical and verbal harassment  housing insecurity and poverty  and misgendering  Linda  Alok  an activist  want gender to cease to be a criterion for the way we organise society  Alok gamble with their personal security every time they get dress  Brave or foolish  You decide  Every time they go out in a skirt or a dress or makeup they be harassed because they be not seek to pass  perhaps  They wear \u201c men \u2019 s clothing \u201d not see it a men \u2019 s  but a safety  Women challenge them in the woman \u2019 s loo  Alok  These conservative be only concerned with woman \u2019 s safety when it have to do with trans people  YES   Let \u2019

a an employee  Linda  When you \u2019 re Pippa be you still your kid \u2019 Dad  Yes  say Pippa  I don \u2019 t like that question  it could be seek information  but it sound like a challenge to me  Speaking to the audience  Linda challenge prejudice I would prefer the programme to explain who people be  rather than bully listener into deny what we be not  Why assume discomfort  I suppose Linda be speak for that nonaccepting audience member  so that Pippa can answer  It \u2019 s much more accepted than when I be at school  Children see it all the time  We felt the wrath of nonbinary activist during our research  Well  yes  Do you need to make an issue of it  Can you not just accept u  People who transition feel their own journey and identity may be invalidate by these genderqueer upstart  I like what she say here  how we be prickly because of societal transphobia  I can accept others if I can accept myself  2117  Then  there be feminist  No  TERFs  a subset of feminist  We put the objection to our young and old contributor  This enable Linda to say thing like lot of woman and girl be gender nonconforming  Finn  I didn \u2019 t identify with women\u2026 When I wear dress I want to look like a boy in a dress  that \u2019 s the kind of nonbinaryness that I want to see myself have  Linda  To be nonbinary  you have to believe in the binary  Kate  I want future without gender to

could not deal with the vilification  That \u2019 s the point  While there be vilification  let u be gentle with anyone \u2019 s way of express nonconformity  Linda end  \u201c The future be look a lot less binary \u201d  That mean freedom for everyone  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 27 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
