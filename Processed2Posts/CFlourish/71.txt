usually involve a teen who be anxious  depressed  socially isolated  or suffer from PTSD come to identify a trans after internet binge on social medium site  These parent report that mental health professional be validate the selfdiagnosis of transgender after a handful of therapy session  without any exploration of prior mental health issue  trauma  sexual orientation  or history of gender nonconforming behavior  This clearly violate APA recommendation  which urge special caution in treat adolescent who present with sudden onset dysphoria  This be the basis of a great deal of hatred of \u201c trans activist \u201d and opposition to transition  So  be it true  There be story of young woman who go through a phase in their teen of desire topsurgery  but their parent help them avoid that and these young woman feel they have have a lucky escape  Of course they be young woman  not trans men  And here be a story of \u201c wreckage \u201d  where the child be distance from their parent  who feel the diagnosis be wrong  After a 30minute consultation with a physician \u2019 s assistant  Molly be give an appointment for the following week to begin testosterone injection  There be no exploration of her other physical and mental health issue  and whether these may have influence her belief that she be trans  Testosterone can have a serious effect on a female body  even at the first injection  These be the story feminist tell each other  I find it after an illadvised attempt to find common ground on Mumsnet  the comment thread refer u to it  call it \u201c a heartbreaking tale of social contagion \u201d  It contravene the World Professional Association for Transgender Health  WPATH  guideline  pdf  which state  The criterion for hormone therapy be a follow  1  Persistent  welldocumented gender dysphoria  2  Capacity to make a fully inform decision and to consent for treatment  3  Age of majority in a give country  if young  follow the Standards of Care outline in section VI   4  If significant medical or mental health concern be present  they must be reasonably wellcontrolled  Dysphoria here be clearly not \u201c welldocumented \u201d  arguably not \u201c persistent \u201d  and the mental health concern should be assess  The PA  physician assistant  also suggest that Molly schedule top surgery \u2013 a double mastectomy \u2013 within a few month  No wonder people be shock  read this sort of story  The WPATH guideline say many people find comfort with altered gender expression without surgery  and qualify mental health professional must make an assessment before surgery  and Assess  diagnose  and discuss treatment option for coexisting mental health concern  Chest surgery may be carry out after one year of T and ample time of living in the desired gender role  The parent say they want time to think and research  and at first the child agree  but at college without tell the parent start T The child or young adult kept repeat that she didn \u2019 t want to see u  that we be the reason she have be hospitalize because we didn \u2019 t support her transition  Max \u201c do not blossom into his true self \u201d  He be more anxious and isolate than ever and rarely leave the house  spend most of his time online  I tell people you don \u2019 t get hormone easily or quickly  especially a a child  This story  contradict the WPATH guideline  say differently  I don \u2019 t believe it  T after half an hour with a physician assistant  A PA \u2019 s qualification take less time than a medical degree  and they practise medicine supervise by a physician  They may diagnose and treat  I saw a consultant psychiatrist on the NHS  The post allege that teenage girl identify a trans because of social contagion  from visit website which valorize be trans  Other condition allegedly spread in the same way  Bulimia be virtually unknown until the 1970s  but once describe there be a common language for it  and it spread into culturally remote enclave follow the introduction of Western medium source  NYMag confirm that  and Lisa Marchiano quote the researcher NYMag interview  Fiji first get television in 1995  and shortly after the first teenage girl there show symptom of eat disorder  What do you think  Partly it depend on whether be trans be acceptable  It could be unacceptable for conservative reason  that God make u male and female  or for radical feminist reason  that there be no necessary connection between sex and gender  and both sex exhibit a wide range of gendered behaviour  It seem possible to me that I transition because of social pressure  The story be out there  People be angry  If girl imagine that transition be the answer to their problem  though they could have live a normal woman within the freedom of gender expression which other woman carve out for themselves  perhaps they be right to be angry  You only learn that medical transition be not the answer to your problem when you have complete it  without robust gatekeeping  In the comment  someone suggest autistic girl might find boys easy to grok than female teen  and it \u2019 s easy to see how a young woman who have no interest or patience for make up and complicate hairdo  who hat frilly clothes  too uncomfortable for those who be \u201c sensory \u201d   and who have a blunt communication style can come to wonder if she be \u201c really \u201d female or \u201c actually \u201d male instead  especially a adolescence brings on an increase in gender difference  Speculation become feverish  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page
