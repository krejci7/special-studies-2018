 so we be men  It \u2019 s scientific  innit  The word \u201c man \u201d have always have a different meaning from adult human with testicle  Rudyard Kipling  if you can show unswerving integrity  moral courage  and gentle acceptance of others \u2019 inadequacy  if you never complain or show weakness  and If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they be go  And so hold on when there be nothing in you Except the Will which say to them  \u2018 Hold on  \u2019 You \u2019 ll be a Man  which may or may not be different from a \u201c man \u201d  Well I try my damnedest  and I couldn \u2019 t  Force anything that hard and it break  Someone quote George Orwell  Don \u2019 t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak be to narrow the range of thought  In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible  because there will be no word in which to express it  Every concept that can ever be need will be express by exactly one word  with it mean rigidly define and all it subsidiary meaning rub out and forget  Ah  they be a martyr for Truth  rather than a tedious  pedantic  unmannerly oaf  call me a \u201c man \u201d  Actually  that quote support me rather than them  They seek to simplify  we multiply word to seek to express nuance gender queer  gender fluid  nonbinary  trans woman  They want to appear so Clear  Definite and Right  and be angry and desperate  Trying to answer with science \u201c I have a woman \u2019 s brain  look at this study of white matter \u201d \u2013 be a good start  That argument sometimes work  sometimes doesn \u2019 t  Scientific analysis show many variation on the genitals  in intersex condition  and in the gene of those who appear to be ci  However  you be on the \u201c man \u201d side if you have or have work testicle and penis  and I share the feminist objection to assert that innate gendered difference in brain cause men a a group to behave differently from all woman  There be too great a range of behaviour in both gender for it to be so rigid  I feel the word \u201c man \u201d and \u201c woman \u201d have a use  \u201c Manliness \u201d  \u201c manhood \u201d and \u201c man \u201d define an ideal  which be enforce in the culture  We don \u2019 t fit it  The answer be  change the culture  but that can \u2019 t be do quickly  Meanwhile  some people transition  We have be do it for thousand of year  and the threat of death have not stop u  I could not have accept my feminine self without transition  As thing stand  present male be just too difficult for me  Then  this powerless group become a political football  EU human right law have lead to the Gender Recognition Act in Britain  The law say I be female  It make my life easier  It be generally a working compromise  I dress female  use a female name  make some effort to lighten my voice  and mostly get by  Vulnerable people  for whom this be the most important thing in our life mostly get tolerate  It take all sort to make a world  Me identify a female be weird for some people  but then some people identify a Scottish first  or British  or Glaswegian  or European  and the relative importance differs for each person and some of u get very steam up about that  Anything human be rarely cut and dry  It be continually change  Some of the objection be transphobic  Ew  Men in woman \u2019 s clothes  I want to be myself  I might look a bit odd  Greater acceptance of diversity benefit everyone  free u to benefit from each others \u2019 gift unrestricted by the strain of try to appear normal  Everyone become aware of more possibility  some of which they might try out  Everyone feel less need to conform  so a none of u fit stereotype completely we be all more free  It be possible that acceptance of a trans woman a a woman in some exceptional situation may harm other vulnerable people  That be certainly not true in every case  and the risk of someone be upset at see a trans woman in some random public loo be not a good reason for prohibit all trans woman from woman \u2019 s loos  There might be particular circumstance where a trans woman should not use woman \u2019 s space  I be open to persuasion  We should behave considerately in woman \u2019 s space  but then  everyone should behave considerately in every public space  That particular individual be incorrigible  Consider more of their drivellings  if we erase the notion of biological sex from the language  it would be impossible to walk into a wrong bathroom or discriminate against the opposite sex  But then we will live in the 1984 dystopia  What a martyr they be  I don \u2019 t want to erase the notion of biological sex  just permit the odd discrepancy  because human culture be complex  and change it difficult  require bodges  Casting the issue in such apocalypic term  they be surely justify in cause me such small discomfort a to instruct me what toilet to use  It be not an argument  There will be no meeting of mind  It be a power struggle  Continued  Is a cis woman really a woman  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 12 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
