"tags": ["being human", "trans", "acceptance", "passing"], "text": "A onetime friend  who be not obviously wicked  look at a trans man  He write  I don \u2019 t have any issue with this person cross dressing  or go further if they want  Nor that they want to call themselves a man  use a man \u2019 s name\u2026  want to identify themselves a a man   ie  if they look in a mirror and say\u2026 \u201c that \u2019 s a man \u201d  \u2026 and want to play be a man  I don \u2019 t see any issue  Unfortuntely this person also want me to experience them and identify them a a man  I would dearly love to  a it mean much to them  and it  i can see  would make them happy  Sadly\u2026 I just don \u2019 t  It \u2019 s not that I can \u2019 t experience them a a man  it \u2019 s not about ability   nor that I win \u2019 t experience them a a man  it \u2019 s not about will  It \u2019 s just that I\u2026 don \u2019 t  M show minimal level of tolerance  \u201c I don \u2019 t have any issue \u201d  you \u2019 d good not  Objecting to the trans man use a man \u2019 s name  etc  be like object to a woman wear a mini skirt  or flat  impose his own standard of morality on how the trans man express himself  Some trans people like neutral pronoun  but if the man want to be call \u201c he \u201d  use \u201c them \u201d be below the standard of courtesy I would expect  However M use \u201c they \u201d  Why  Both to honour their preference to no longer identify a their birth gender  but also and at the same time honour and validate my own experience  when I don \u2019 t experience someone a a gender other than their birth gender   Oh  God  He claim the right to define the other  I be not sure I understand M \u2019 s line about ability or will  If I look at a black man and see him as different to ordinary people and then feel intensely uncomfortable around my own racism  and seek to treat him reasonably and suppress my see him a different the conscious effort to accept  while good than intolerance  be still racism  I can control how I respond  to an extent  I can avoid voice objection  M would accept a black man  I assume  I don \u2019 t accuse him of racism  even the small internal vestige of it but he be force to say this be different  The trans man be not a man  so we should treat him differently from men  Or M suffers some loss  \u201c This have change the safety of the  men \u2019 s  space for \u201d him  Aha  So now we have a conflict of right  rather than a failure to accept another human be a he be  See the winsome way he express that  I \u2019 m not threaten by the person  I do feel that the person \u2019 s presence in that space have break the nature of what I have previously go to that space to find  You don \u2019 t have to like everyone but disapprove of their way of dressing  or not recognise their change of name  be claim a right to define them in a way they reject  If you want to define another person you have good have good argument why that be appropriate  I include refuse to accept their choice of pronoun in that right they have to selfdefine  Do you want other people to see them in the same way  On Friday night I discuss a man over the phone  I have not meet him  but my friend warn he behave in a disconcerting way around old woman  and I take her suspicion seriously and feel she have a right to tell me  If I meet him I will make my own judgment  But again  if you warn others against a person or want them to feel the same way about that person  you should have a good reason for that  There be time when I DO experience someone a other than their birth gender  usually through error but sometimes because they be more successfully present a their transgender \u2019 d self than some do and haven \u2019 t yet out their own previous \u201c status \u201d   ie  I \u2019 m convince and have buy into their presentation  This be pass privilege  We can be accept a we be as long a we give no clue of our history so we can never talk of it  never use a male voice for emphasis or provocation  we be constrain into the clich\u00e9 way of be a woman  Once outed  we trans woman be know a men  Then you judge u on the way we look  and feel deceive if you find u out  M say he want to see the trans man a a man  but just do not  This trans man want to go to a men \u2019 s group  What do a men \u2019 s group have in common  exactly  If M be happy to have me there  it have to be something which I share  perhaps a Y chromosome  or some experience  or lack of it  Women \u2019 s experience of patriarchy might bring them together  what bring men that include me  And why do men attend a man \u2019 s group  For practice recognise man \u2019 s emotion  or express in a man \u2019 s way for stretch that expression  Learning how to be a man now  or unlearn old lesson  Maybe I should try a men \u2019 s group  I don \u2019 t see  though  how the trans man can alter the group \u2019 s nature in a way that I can \u2019 t in the thing people say or do  in the argument or feelings except that his go change the definition of \u201c man \u201d from one not recognise the reality or value of trans  to one that do  It change M \u2019 s definition of \u201c man \u201d to a broad one M have not consent to  I say I would blog about this  We have be message back and forth  This surprise him  Well  like everyone else I be try to navigate the impossibility of \u201c be myself \u201d and \u201c fitting in \u201d  I can \u2019 t be certain it be more difficult for me than for anyone else  but I know from experience my own desperation to fit a particular kind of Manliness it certainly felt taboo to permit myself  a a man  the feeling I felt then the feeling that my way of be be grudgingly accept when I call myself by a woman \u2019 s name  I get a passport say \u201c F \u201d when a doctor certify I would probably present female for the rest of my life  if I fit the Statedefined idea of \u201c trans woman \u201d I would be acceptable  But M do not accept that  I feel erased  It feel like we be discuss his right to erase me  It do not make it any good  from my perspective  that he want to make the trans man happy  I be try to be reasonable and respectful  but I feel intensely uncomfortable  It \u2019 s all about him his perception  his feeling  his loss  I find it hard to see that he have a loss beyond a slight discomfort at the man \u2019 s presence in his man \u2019 s group  He have make much of it  but really could just say  \u201c Oh  OK then \u201d and think of something else  Any man in the men \u2019 s group may change it dynamic in way he dislike  We be never in control  and that might make him more eager to exclude the trans man just in this moment  when he can make some sort of rationalsounding argument  he can exclude the trans man  exercise some sort of control  and feel good  however bad he make others feel  To an extent  I don \u2019 t care for myself  I be a man a woman both neither whatever Clare  I don \u2019 t need you to see me in a particular way to feel good about myself  But others of u do  It can really hurt  And he could behave courteously to trans people  That he do not feel the need enough to actually do it be unpleasant  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 22 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
