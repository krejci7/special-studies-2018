nowhere  \u201c You \u2019 re be very condensating  \u201d say the man I be refer to  and after half an hour my brain be so cabbaged that I know he mean something else  but do not know the word for it  Thank you  you don \u2019 t need to say it now  I work it out for myself later  In the ninety I know a man  still the most boring man I have ever meet  I can \u2019 t remember his name  but it end in an \u00ed sound  a contemptuous diminutive  Nicky or Ricky or Donny or something anyway  he get very drunk on whisky  and ever thereafter could not drink it  He find a sip nauseating  Dismissively contemptuous  Neil say he probably have have no head for it anyway  he get drunk on a couple of glass  I associate those story  \u201c Condensating \u201d be the moment I get nowhere with the benefit authority  that I could not take any more  I can not bear it  I could not bear another such conversation  it nauseate me  Another myth  Margaret saw me a Clare for the first time  and say  \u201c It \u2019 s a if you be act when you \u2019 re Stephen  just you when you \u2019 re Clare \u201d  Aha  I be a woman really  I be right to transition  The story become my conclusive evidence that I be right  the judgment of another person which I cling to  and take out for reassurance from time to time  It be my selfimage  I know who I be  and \u201c you \u2019 re just you when you \u2019 re Clare \u201d be part of it  Then about a year ago  I take off my wig and put on my cycle helmet  appear androgynous  but continue talk  and H say \u201c You have this lovely male energy \u201d  Her belief  her politics  or her individual judgment of me need have no bearing on me  but have have  I could if I want call that comment on Wednesday 2 March 2016 the decisive moment where my lie come apart where my truth be undermined Several time I have pick on particular date where all change  change utterly for me  H have change my view of the world  I be not sure if I have ever be entirely sure that I be a woman I joke \u201c I don \u2019 t know  and neither do my psychiatrist \u201d  and say \u201c I \u2019 m both and neither and in between \u201d  Her word \u201c lovely \u201d just make the blade sharper  Either it be liberating yes  I be a man  I need no longer assert a falsehood that I be a woman or terrifying and destructuring  and I try to piece together the shard of my framework  world map  understand which let me navigate the world  \u201c I be a man  but transition be the best I could do  \u201d I say  \u201c Bad thing happen to good people \u201d Or I create a new narrative  \u201c I be a trans woman \u201d  I have the right to be this way  Brexit and Trump  and possibly this year Fillon and AfD  change my comforting narrative  one which be probably yours too  It be a debased Whig version of history  just a the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 be a decisive moment of progress  which change the way of do politics in England from battle to individual murder  a clear improvement  so Obergefell v Hodges be a step into the light  which could not be reverse  A Tory version of history  that there be random event with no broad significance  be reassert  so that Trump \u2019 s Muslim ban be not a pathetic attempt by the failing force of reaction  but a random event of quite a much significance a Obergefell  We need to change our story  Since 2016  our story have not be the Truth  but a comfort lie to help u get through the day without collapse on the floor  scream  The word \u201c male energy \u201d be a stake through their heart  a be the Muslim ban  \u201c Do your duty  Republicans  \u201d say the New York Times  \u201c Prosecute him  \u201d Trump meanwhile promise a new Muslim ban which will be less vulnerable to judicial scrutiny  I have be reading of story  Here \u2019 s Rachel Cusk in the NYT  In psychoanalysis  event be reconstruct in the knowledge of their outcome  The therapeutic property of narrative lie in it capacity to ascribe meaning to suffer that at the time seem to have no purpose  The liberal elite be in shock  they fall upon the notion of the victor \u2019 regret a a palliative for their mental distress  but because the referendum result be irreversible  this narrative must adopt the form of tragedy  And  write of her mother She didn \u2019 t care what she say  or rather  she exact from word the licentious pleasure of misuse  in so do  she take my weapon and break it before my eye  She make fun of me for the word I use  and I couldn \u2019 t respond by threaten her with death  I couldn \u2019 t say \u201c I could kill you \u201d because it wasn \u2019 t true  and in language I have stake everything on tell the truth  I have have that experience debate Creationists  I try to persuade  use truth  they simply assert their Beliefs  \u201c It can not be so  because of Genesis \u201d It be bad enough debate a blogger on the other side of the world how much more terrifying  to face your own mother \u2019 s assertion  Thus saith the LORD  There be no answer to that  Tim build an impenetrable wall of language to shield him from the truth  Or just  my understanding of the World  The defeated liberal be abash  so less confidently assertive  Anna Blundy  in a completely different essay a short column not a hefty work like Rachel Cusk \u2019 s also address make sense of truth with word  Language distance u from our real thought and feeling in an almost defensive way  the fact that it make u feel well to have name something  perhaps be even indicative of that  \u2026 we \u2019 re try to repackage something into a digestible form that will make the symptom of the sufferer more bearable  Surely it be well to face the unvarnished truth  This essay say that news broadcast and advertising alike end up tell stories\u2026 the mastery of danger  the satisfaction of desire and the ultimate restoration of morality  But here  an effort be make to lead people to believe that the story accurately depict people and event  As a result  all end up profoundly falsify what they portray  once again mix faithful and manipulate image  and fact and fiction in seamless way so that it can be hard to tell where one end and the other begin  The attack be mitigate by the fact that the essay itself have a similarly comforting structure  where the restoration of morality be u all become more sceptical about the medium  It be not at all reassure to say that I can \u2019 t bear another phone conversation with the benefit authority  I could say  well I have hundred before  many of them successful  or simply that I should eschew prediction of the future  which may just be paranoia  and concentrate on the actual task  I know what the task involve  Fear of what bad thing will happen and how I will respond when I fail just get in the way  This be my two thousandth post  on a blog about me  truth  trans  the world  and everything that interest me  I do it to be read  and achieve less of that than I would like  Joanna write a short post recommend one of mine  and I be grateful for the recommendation  because my post get more than three time the view from it  than 75  of my post get from all source  This be my least worthwhile goal  to see that I have have more view  Writing of Donald Trump stretch my writing  but get few view  a most of my reader come from a Trans site  so I restrict my choice of subject to get more view  Posting daily get more view  I get a tiny dopamine hit when I see my pageview number have increased nearly 198000 view in five and a half year  I might be good to write long essay  I could develop an ability to analyse an idea in great depth  This be not that  I have quote undigested screed from three essay and some of my own thought on truth  rather than explain the essay  create a satisfying narrative argument in my own word  and polish it  Writing around 500 word a day be good practice  but I want to edit and structure something more satisfying than these short piece  I have publish just one 2000 word article  I love Rachel Cusk \u2019 s essay how I would love to write something like that  I blog to tease out my understanding  as well  It be psychoanalysis for me  repackaging reality into that digestible form  So I have write how transition or surgery be the best thing I could have do  and the bad  in separate piece  and wonder how to unite them  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 17 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
