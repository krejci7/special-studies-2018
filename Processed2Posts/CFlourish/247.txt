politically unattractive  Another radical feminist article on Trans  Political philosopher Rebecca ReillyCooper do not like the word \u201c ci \u201d  It create  s  a false binary between those who conform to the gender norm associate with their sex  and those who do not  In reality  everybody be nonbinary  We all actively participate in some gender norm  passively acquiesce with others  and positively rail against others still  Indeed  everyone do  and some  a radical feminist  make a particular political point about it  It would be irritate to be call \u201c ci \u201d if you load onto the term all you hat most about conformity to patriarchal gendered culture  but it do not mean that  It mean \u201c not trans \u201d  The radical feminist be fight gender in their way  point out privilege and oppression  show gender concept don \u2019 t really fit people  and we fight it in ours  with breastbinding  T injection and genderneutral pronoun  As she say on her blog  Another generation of bright  committed  impassioned woman be be wear down  Being kill by the power of sisterhood  While that privilege and oppression exist  it make no sense for those of u subvert it to squabble like this  Some of u subvert through patient philosophical exploration and explanation  and some through play game  We all do it through be  insisting on the pronoun \u201c they \u201d rather than \u201c she \u201d be an overt way of escape femininity and gendered expectation  Kudos to all who escape it  subtly or unsubtly  She do not like that gameplaying  gender a a label to adopt so that you now have a way to describe just how large and multitudinous and interesting you be  That word \u201c interest \u201d  with such heavy irony   T  hey be far too interesting and revolutionary and transgressive for something a ordinary and conventional a ci  I be frivolous  It be my way of survive  I niggle and provoke  with a little giggle a a defensive measure  I don \u2019 t deny her interestingness  why should she disparage mine  I be not a philosopher  I be not like Humour in Babi Yar  but he be my example  Tsars  king  emperor  Rulers of the world  Commanded parade But humor \u2013 humor they could not\u2026 He be use to stern glance  But it do not hurt him  And humor look upon himself At time with humor  He be everlasting  He be smart  And nimble  He will walk through everything and everybody  And so  glory to humor  He be a courageous fellow  I be so peeved to read of the concept of  name  gender  a I come up with it spontaneously in November  and want to be original  My gender be \u201c Clare \u201d  There be no other accurate label  How well could I dance  a if the bar of the cage do not exist  The logical conclusion of all this be  if gender be a spectrum  not a binary  then everyone be trans  Or alternatively  there be no trans people  Either way  this a profoundly unsatisfactory conclusion  and one that serve both to obscure the reality of female oppression  as well a to erase and invalidate the experience of transsexual people  Please don \u2019 t insist that I be logical  Thank God I be inconsistent  because consistent people be either inerrant  this be unlikely  or their consistency force them beyond what the observed fact justify  We be paradoxical  in an unknowable world  see through a glass darkly  I don \u2019 t know why I want to transition  but I want it so I do  She call me a jailer  and I feel so unfree  I love her Doctor Who reference  because I be a fan  and I want to make connection here human personality  be  \u2026 more like a big ball of wibblywobbly  humanywumany stuff  A slight concession to dance humourists\u2026 She summarise the trans position  An oftrepeated mantra \u2026 be that \u2018 gender be not a binary  it \u2019 s a spectrum \u2019  What follow from this view be not that we need to tear down the pink and the blue box  rather  we simply need to recognise that there be many more box than just these two  No  we be in a state of change  but the liberation struggle take time  We need to chip away at the pink and blue box  If they might collapse like a wet paper bag it would have happen by now  This be part of grow and mature a a human be  All our life we be in tension between conformity and individuality  If we be all to deny that we have an innate  essential gender identity  then the label \u2018 agender \u2019 would become redundant  a lacking in gender would be a universal trait  Indeed  I don \u2019 t know what the world will be like without gendered expectation  but give that not everyone be radical feminist there be people who be not actively oppose gender why should you turn your ire on me  Gender a a hierarchy perpetuate the subordination of female people to male people  and constrain the development of both sex  Yes  That be the problem  Please let me work on my own solution to it  The idea that gender be a spectrum be a new gender prison article  Rebecca
