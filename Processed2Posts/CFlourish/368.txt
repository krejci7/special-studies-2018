about what exactly be involve when she transition  Also in HD  Wow  Half an hour to tell \u201c what be involve in transition \u201d  physical  emotional  social to an audience of million on one of the top four TV channel  Three hour of TV in total  One acclaim Edinburgh show  I do not recognise you  I don \u2019 t watch this stuff  Had I be approach a starstruck fan or seek to make you a contact to get a toehold do that sort of thing  I would have approach in a different way  I could not have do it  My short piece  intend originally a part of a one woman show  have be well receive by audience even of a hundred people at open mics  I have a meeting with a TV producer in January  to discuss a film write by and star me about what be involve when I transition  One meeting  He do not want to proceed  I still have the note I produce for our discussion  if any TV producer read be interested  but have no idea how to end it  Life go on  I suppose  We go through Hell  and end up in Purgatory  I read you  I saw a trans woman  My friend do not read you  I be not certain  and it be mostly your height that give you away not your grooming  possibly something very subtle in the shape of your face even though there be cis woman with more masculine appearance  What I want be to talk of our feeling about the experience we have just share  the play Bakkhai  in which everyone \u2019 s

the theatre  I would like to  What do you do in the theatre  I work in the box office  At which time I decide I have be fib at  play with and mock enough  and end the conversation  So  why be so completely horrible  One do not normally strike up conversation with stranger in theatre  but in bus queue  bus  train  the Tate Gallery  even on the Tube  I have manage it  Most people be happy to talk  But one of the horror of our condition be that we do not associate with each other  It be a threat  We be more likely to be read  in twos certainly you be more likely to be read with me  everyone read me  Or I remind you of the difficulty of transition and the sheer fuck inadequacy of most people face it and of your own feeling of inadequacy  fear and anger under this burden  perhaps  how you felt before transition and perhaps even now  Rather than find sisterly solidarity  like Scots expats get together in Seattle  I become the focus of your ridicule  You don \u2019 t know me  I do not deserve that  \u2665\u2665\u2665 I have have this email response  Dear Abigail  Thank you for post an interesting if rather disconcert blog  I deeply regret that I seem to have \u201c rebuff \u201d you \u2013 this be not my intention  I be wait to meet somebody after the theatre  I be distract by the swirling throng of excitable Japanese girl await their idol  Ben Whishaw  I be very tired  I do not like be ask outright if I be trans  I be NOT be transphobic and the public accusation that I be be most distressing  I habitually go to the theatre alone and tend to take time to process what I have just see \u2013 I don \u2019 t like have to undertake an immediate postperformance postmortem  This be not personally direct at you  a total stranger  who approach me from nowhere \u2013 rather  I be like this with friend  family or foe  I sincerely do not intend to make you the latter  For the record \u2013 I do indeed work in a Box Office  and have do so for most of my work life  I have rent to pay  I be not proud and do not hide the fact that I need a day job in order to do so  until such time a my career take off   So I be not lie to you  I didn \u2019 t want to embarrass you  or appear an even big dickhead than you clearly think I be  by say \u201c Oh  but surely you must know who I be  haven \u2019 t you see Boy Meets Girl  \u201d I would have appreciate your writing to me before post your blog a I feel I have be unfairly depict in the public eye and I would appreciate it enormously if you would either amend it or post a detraction  or at least quote my defence  Thanking you  I wish you luck and happiness and peace and light  Rebecca \u2665\u2665\u2665 This blog be public  but very small circulation  and I have change the post title  formerly your name  to something inconspicuous  though you remain identifiable  I have not otherwise change what I originally write  The point be  apart from my own envy and respect  there be a difference between the question \u201c Are you trans  \u201d from someone ci  and someone trans  I try to allude  rather than ask straight out  I think we have something in common  Well  we \u2019 re both tall  er  be you trans  I do not want to embarrass you  then  Feeling isolate among all the ci folk  for there be so few of u  I want to make contact  especially a I have so love the play \u2019 s treatment of transition  But why should the question be embarrass  if there be nothing wrong with be trans  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 37 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
