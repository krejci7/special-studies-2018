an inability to sense that one stomach be full  she could eat a tin of golden syrup a a light snack  She do not have a positive diagnosis of this  James tell me that she might ignore cooking instruction  put a chicken into an oven at 200\u00b0  say  for the requisite time  but not give the oven time to heat up first  \u201c Don \u2019 t eat with her \u201d  he say  The sausage she cook for me be unappetising  I watch her put on her tights  just stick her foot in and pull  predictably make a hole in them  and then pull down a loose handful to cover the hole  Andy tell me he have be

16\u2033 with a deep baritone  talk of stay with various friend lead me to draw the conclusion that they be rescue her in a similar way  When I tell her of the supportive community of MCC Manchester  she evince interest  I later find that Andy have manage to persuade her not to move there  James tell me that MCC Manchester be more of a first aid station than a church community  people would join  get patch up  reconcile their faith with their homosexuality  and move on  Andy have to stop the extempore prayer segment of worship  because of the people who use it to moan about what an awful week they have have  Sandra have transition and work a a nurse  but when she have to move back with her parent they insist that she present male  She have take her credit card  in her female name  to Next  and when she could not use it there have make such a scene that she be section  She get a commissiononly job sell \u00a31000 vacuum cleaners wonderful thing  but not appropriate for Oldham \u2019 s terrace houses and her enthusiasm increase until she be section again  She introduce me to the electrologist who deal with my facial hair problem  I only go in the old  19th century \u201c Bottom Block \u201d once  it long corridor with a 6\u2033 wide floral border paste to the wall would have make me desperate have I not know when I could get out  But Sandra prefer it to the all new Parklands House individual room for the patient  they could even lock their doors because Parklands have no exercise equipment  so be lock in for week drove you up the wall  Not even tabletennis  We do what we can  \u2665\u2665\u2665 That be then  this be now  At karate this morning  I take a moment before we start to become Present  in the moment  The fire door be open  a it be sunny  and I be with the fence outside  It be sharp  hard  cold  straight  erect  unyielding  unbending  point  effective  fit  I find that part of me which be in the Fence  I relate to it  Here  and elsewhere  I need to be these thing  it be good to access these thing in me  I dance with the spirit of the fence  In karate  we practise combination  make it flow  not one move after another but one move naturally into the next  Not  block  then think  what next blockstrike  blockstrike  Then there be that wonderful leap kick  From short fight stance  jump forward  lift the back leg up into a halfkick which be a feint  land on that foot and kick forward with the other  With practice  one could be a yard forward  force a block which go the wrong way  and kick through the person  More practice kicking  then hold the foot in the air for a moment after  then place it down  The body be always under control  ", "feedtitle": "trans \u2013 Page 49 \u2013 Clare Flourish"}
